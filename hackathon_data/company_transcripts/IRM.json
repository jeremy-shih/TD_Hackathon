My name is Anita, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 2012 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Golden, you may now begin your conference.","Stephen P. Golden","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2012 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for your questions. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2012 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.","As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release.","With that, I would like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.","C. Richard Reese","Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. As you've seen from our press release this morning, our business performance is really pretty clean and as we forecasted, and since we spoke about our business to you only about 2 months ago, maybe with a little luck, this call may be shorter than usual. But we'll get started, and let's see where it takes us.","But before we get started and deep dive into the business, I want to update you on the status of our special committee work. The progress is ongoing, and we will meet our commitment to report the Board's conclusions and rationale for its conclusions no later than June 9. Since we're close to reaching a conclusion, we will not be entertaining any questions on this topic today or in any future meeting until we come forth with the final answers.","So having said that, I realize that may disappoint some of you, but we are getting down to the short strokes, and we're going to have to keep anything close to our vest, and I realize many of you will try to ask questions or want to ask questions to try to get some insight to how we're thinking about it, but we're just going to have to be pretty disciplined and basically, we're not going to answer them. So just be prepared for this.","One year ago, I returned as CEO, and we announced the new 3-year plan, which was focused on driving returns on capital and returning capital in excess of that required to operate our strategy to you, our shareholders. We have made excellent progress in all fronts. At the time, I committed to giving you a report card on our progress against our plan, and since we are one year from announcement and nearly halfway through execution, I'll review our progress on this plan and its impact on our business. ","But before I do that, let me make a few comments on the quarter. As I said in the beginning, performance showed consistent trends. We operated as planned. Total revenue on a constant dollar basis grew at 1%, and adjusted OIBDA grew at 2%. Without the impact of the declining in recycled paper prices we've been speaking to you about for a couple of quarters, total revenue would have been up 2%, and adjusted OIBDA of up 4%, as paper is a 1% drag on revenue growth and a 2% drag on adjusted OIBDA. FX is a 1% drag on both of those, by the way.","Our team is executing well, and the underlying business trends are consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters. We continue to focus on sustaining our annuity revenue stream driven by storage over the long-term and believe that we can maintain a low single-digit growth rate in annuity revenues over the long-term even in the face of the secular trends on the activity and use of physical information. Storage growth was up 3% in constant dollars for the quarter. This is 2% coming out of North America. International had a very strong 7% constant dollar storage growth. And as you know, storage is the annuity flywheel. It is the foundation of our business. It is -- out of that is what's all good things are derived because it's the beginning of the relationship and the center of the relationship with our customers and then also drives the majority of our margins.","Storage gains were partially offset by a service revenue decline of 2% in constant dollars. Activity trends remain the same. Our core service where these activity trends are shown, though was a positive 1% in constant dollars. Activity-based core service revenues were down moderately in North America and consistent with the past. But this impact was offset by strong international gains and by strong global growth in hybrid revenues. Comp services were down 9%. This is driven primarily by paper, which was down 31% on a price basis for the quarter from last year. And paper is expected to remain a headwind throughout the year. Paper -- the impact of paper though, is partially offset by some improvement in project revenues and some of our other core service lines.","Profit's performance was strong for the quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins were up 40 basis points. International adjusted OIBDA increased 15% on constant currency basis with margins up 200 basis points. And I'll talk more about this later. North America did as we asked and sustained their strong margins even in a headwind of some mix of businesses and recycled paper prices being down. As you know, it's a very strong margin business, at 41% adjusted OIBDA margins. So Q1 was a good start for the year and in our business, if you start behind in the beginning, it's almost impossible to make it up, but if you get off to a good start, the year looks pretty good. And we remain optimistic for the year because we've had a good start.","So now let me shift gears and talk to you a little bit about this strategic plan and where it's leading us, and so forth. As I said one year ago, we announced the 3-year strategic plan and made certain commitments to you. 2011 was the first year of the operating plan, and it runs through 2013. And the strategy featured 3 key elements: First is a refocus on our traditional physical storage and services business, which was primarily impacted in North America. And as you know, we sold our digital services business to Autonomy for $390 million last year. In North America, which is our largest business, our plan is and remains to be to build out on our market leadership position and to invest to sustain this business for the long term. It has a consistent storage growth of about 2%, sustained strong margins of 41% and good capital efficiency delivering an after-tax return on invested capital of about 15%. This is a high return business and our goal is optimize it by investing for sustainability. Continuous margin expansion is offsetting service headwinds and funding incremental investments in support of the annuity. In 2011, we increased sales and marketing investment by about approximately $20 million. It takes time for an increase in investment of this type to share results, but we believe we're seeing a return on investment in excess to 15% on our sales and marketing investments. We're seeing a slight uptick in unit growth, the storage on the margin and expansion of other services helping offset the core service trends. We've shown that if we can increase the input investment, we can get a good return. And we'll likely make several investments from time to time in the future where we see a clear path to returns.","Additionally, one change we're seeing in North America since we announced our plan is an increase in acquisition opportunities that we may take advantage of from time to time. We have a particularly strong network to acquire into and realize significant synergies from and therefore, great returns on invested capital. We will be disciplined as we look at these opportunities, and they will all be return on investment capital-focused, not \"strategic\". ","Now let me shift and talk about the second leg of our strategy, which was our International business, where our focus is on driving returns from our previous investments. We have the leading information and management services company internationally. The business has good growth, currently 7% storage, and which is the foundation and 5% total. And our portfolio as a whole, achieved good returns beating our hurdle rates through our work we did last year. We built this business using footprint strategy to acquire critical mass for customer coverage and to expand our access to future high-growth markets. In doing so, we have a mix of businesses on our portfolio with varying levels of performance, and as part of our strategic plan, when it took -- undertook a strategic review of all of our business units and developed strategies to drive returns based upon certain criteria. ","Our analysis show that being a market leader is the key to driving great returns. In our International markets, where we have a leadership position, which is the majority of our markets, our margins and return on invested capital are in line with those of North America. Our analysis also showed that in 8 markets where we are not leaders, we need to develop plans to improve performance and drive returns up. For 6 of those 8 markets, France, Germany, Spain, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore, we have plans that are already bearing fruit, and we'll be bringing them in line with our expected returns by 2013. And in 2 markets, New Zealand and Italy, we decided to exit, and we're executing on that strategy, one we've completed and the other, we've almost completed. ","The last category in our portfolio is the BRIC markets, where we currently have small but fast-growing businesses. We expect to invest to achieve market leader position where we can do so at attractive prices. More on this in a minute.","The International business portfolio performed very well with strong margin accretion of 200 basis points in Q1. This is on top of 220 basis points of margin accretion last year, and puts us on target to get the 700 basis points of improvement we planned for by 2013. Last year, the focus and the margin accretion came primarily, the 220 basis points, out of the optimization of our biggest International business, the U.K. This year, the focus is in Western Europe and Latin America, where we're taken the same playbooks we used in North America, and exported those to the U.K., and now exporting those into LatAm and Western Europe, and it's already showing great results, as I said it, 200 basis points in Q1 of this year. So we're off to a good start on the International, and we're on track for the full year there also. ","As I've said, investing in high-growth markets to achieve market leadership is a key component of our International strategy as market leadership drives returns. Consistent with this strategy, we acquired Grupo Store based in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil in April. The purchase price is approximately $80 million, and this is a business with approximately $30 million in revenue growing at double digits. It's a good, solid, clean business with great fold-in synergies with our existing platform in Brazil, which we will realize over time. We're breakeven for -- on this on this business on a contribution basis in 2012 due to integration costs, but we expect over the 24- to 36-month timeframe to see this to drive great returns. It has strong revenue growth, and expected post-integration margin expansions will help us drive both strong continued growth and returns beyond this year. When combined with our existing business in Brazil, we will become the market leader in this important emerging market. It's a large market, already estimated to be approximately $1 billion market potential. There's a very active group of competitors pushing the outsourcing conversion trend. We estimate that even with this consolidation of these 2 businesses and the market leadership position, that we have less than 10% share of market, so there remains lots of room for us to continue double-digit growth. And as the market leader, we expect this trend to double-digit growth to continue for quite a long time, and we expect to generate the kinds of returns that the market leadership generate for us and the rest of the world and Brazil over time.","You are likely to see us do more international acquisitions of this nature. As I said, the goal is where we can find good, clean businesses and strong growing markets and help us solidify -- based upon our past work, consolidate and solidify the #1 market leadership position and drive returns. We will take the opportunity to do so. So again, great progress on the strategy and a really good move on the part of our International team. And I think you're going to like what happens there over the long period of time.","The third element of our strategy was a focus on capital allocation. We've committed to return $2.2 billion over 3 years with $1.2 billion coming in the first year. We met that first $1.2 billion commitment with April's dividend payment. This first phase was -- consisted of $1 billion of stock buybacks that we executed, as well as about $200 million in dividends. We are committed to strategy to return the excess capital to shareholders as efficiently as possible, and through the special committee, the Board process, we examine most effective ways to do so. And as I said, we will have more to say on these subjects before June 9.","So in summary, we're off to a good start on our 3-year plan. But as with most plans, this one will not exactly unfold as expected. Lower paper prices, some divestitures and lower service revenues will reduce our expected revenues and OIBDA in 2013 versus the plan. Acquisitions and other positive trends will likely add to the plan. But we expect that the fundamentals of improved operating margins internationally and greater capital efficiency will remain a core part of our plan and our reported performance.","So let me reflect for a second. As I said, we introduced this 3-year plan, approximately a year ago now. It was last April when, as you know, I came out of semi-retirement and came back to the company. And we looked to refocus the company back to its core. And so let me reflect a little bit on that job. I'm very pleased how the business and the organizations have responded in the last year. The business is becoming more and more focused on the core, and more and more focused on driving returns of invested capital out of those core businesses. We have significant opportunity ahead of us. I mean, it's not for a lack of opportunity that we're doing this focus. It's to make sure that we can really be disciplined to execute against this opportunity. And I personally remain very optimistic about the future, which I predict will be dominated by 2 key themes, one is investments to sustain this wonderful annuity business, which has a great return on capital, and to do so over a long period of time. To me, the key is durability or sustainability of the business, and we believe that we have the tools, the capital and the opportunity set to do that. And if we do that well, we will be returning significant capital with our shareholders on a very consistent basis, over a very long period of time.","So as we've shifted our focus on returns, it is clear that though that we should fight the urge to be too greedy. Our market leader businesses are all great return businesses that we want to optimize for the long-term. By driving to even higher margins -- but driving for even higher margins is really not the answer. We need to continue to drive costs down and reinvest those savings for long-term sustainability, and we have an opportunity set that will allow us to accomplish that if we invest correctly. And I think we have the talent to be able to do so. The emerging market businesses and even the non-leader markets that we now remain in, will improve out over time and produce a balance of more growth and better returns. Personally, I wish I were younger and had the opportunity to play off the next phase of the life of Iron Mountain. I see nothing but great opportunity in its future. But of course, I'm not. We have an active search for CEO. We're getting great candidates, but it's not a process to be rushed. This is a great opportunity and we want to find the right leader that can balance the needs of all of our constituents, you, our shareholders, our customers and of course, our employees over the very long period of time. ","As I have often said and many of you shareholders said, one of the real great things about Iron Mountain is not only the annuity business model but this ability to drive this annuity and sustain it over an extremely long period of time. As you know, we spent a lot of capital to build the flywheel, to build the annuity. As I said, this next phase is about having net capital come back out of the business and back to our shareholders. And of course, the longer we can foresee doing that, the much more valuable the company is. When I returned last year, I did state that I expected to be here for 12 to 24 months. We're about halfway through my estimated timeframe, and I expect that I'll meet my original target. But I want to make sure you all know that I remain committed to the company until we find the right leadership for the long-term. But stay tuned as we get closer, we'll talk to you more about where the next phase may be in that area. So with that, let me turn it over to Brian and then we'll take your questions and answers.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Richard. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's financial review. We delivered solid performance in Q1, in line with our plans, reflecting consistent business trends. Our financial results were again, supported by solid storage revenue growth and strong performance in our International business. Reported revenues for Q1 were $746 million, up 1% on a constant currency basis as 3% storage gains were offset by moderate service declines, including the impact of lower recycled paper prices. Profit performance was in line with our expectations, with results supported by strong gains in our International segment and sustained high margins in North America. ","Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $221 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis. International adjusted OIBDA margins increased by 200 basis points to -- compared to Q1 of 2011, keeping us on track to achieve our margin improvement goal of 700 basis-point improvement by the end of 2013. Adjusted EPS was $0.29 in Q1, and reported EPS was $0.35 including the impact of foreign exchange gains and discrete tax items. We continue to expand our International business while driving higher returns, consistent with our 3-year strategic plan. Adjusted OIBDA in the International segment increased 15% on a constant currency basis in Q1, supported by strong growth in emerging markets and benefits from cost improvement initiatives in Latin America and Western Europe. ","As Richard noted, we recently acquired Grupo Store in Brazil, which will position us well to build on this momentum. We're off to good start to the year and are on track towards our full year financial goals. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2012 outlook and adding the impact to the recently completed store acquisition for the balance of the year. We continue to plan for 1% to 3% internal growth excluding the effect of lower paper prices and constant currency adjusted OIBDA gains of 1% to 5% x paper impacts. The store acquisition will add $25 million to revenues and $5 million in CapEx for the remaining 3 quarters of 2012. Adjusted OIBDA gains from this acquisition will be offset by integration costs in 2012.","Let's now turn to Slide 4 and review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2011. As noted, Q1 results were as expected and consistent with recent operating trends. Enterprise revenue growth was flat year-on-year as 1% constant dollar gains were offset by unfavorable year-on-year foreign exchange impacts. Overall revenue performance reflected sustained storage revenue internal growth of 3%, global expansion of hybrid services and higher project revenues. These gains were offset by moderate declines in North America, activity-based core service activities and lower recycled paper revenues. ","From a segment perspective, North America posted flat constant currency revenue growth. Consistent 2% storage internal growth was offset by a 3% decline in service revenues, including the impact of lower paper prices. Service growth continues to be constrained by reduced retrievable and refile, transportation and data protection handling activity. These impacts, along with lower recycled paper revenues, more than offset strong gains and hybrid revenues, increased project revenues and benefits from higher fuel surcharges. Our International segment posted 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, supported by a 7% storage growth reflecting sustained growth in Europe and continued double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These gains were again augmented by strong hybrid revenues which offset impacts from lower paper prices and lower revenues from product sales and shredding services.","Gross profit was $431 million in Q1, yielding a gross margin of 57.8%, up slightly compared to the same prior year period. Storage gross margins increased 240 basis points driven by lower occupancy costs. Service gross margins were down year-on-year due to decreased recycled paper revenues, the previously disclosed reclassification of certain overhead expenses to cost of sales, and the growth of relatively lower margin businesses including our hybrid services. Adjusted OIBDA was $221 million or 29.5% of revenues, up 40 basis points compared to Q1  2011. Sustained high margins in North America and continued strong performance in our International business were key components of the year-on-year margin expansion. Included in adjusting OIBDA is approximately $2 million related to the work of the special committee of the Board. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share. Reported earnings per share of $0.35 include a $3 million of other income and the impact of a lower effective tax rate due to foreign currency gains and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39% as expected.","Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by a major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, compared to our full year expectations. Our internal growth rates for the first quarter were within our expected full year ranges supported by consistent 2% core revenue internal growth. As noted, storage internal growth remains solid at 3%. North America reported consistent 2% internal storage growth, and International storage internal growth remained strong at 6%. Net global Records Management volume was up more than 1% on a year-on-year basis in Q1, reflecting continued strong gains in International and flat year-on-year growth in North America. Pricing trends remain consistent.","Total service internal growth was minus 2% or down about 1%, excluding impacts from commodity changes. These results are also consistent with underlying trends in recent quarters. Core service internal growth was flat in the quarter, as strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher fuel surcharges offset moderate declines in activity-based core service revenues. Complementary service revenues, which represent about 11% of total revenues, decreased 9% internally. Results were impacted by, as expected, by declines in recycled paper revenues reflecting substantially lower recycled paper pricing, as well as lower revenues in our fulfillment business.","Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our segment results. Slide 6 shows key metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to the first quarter of 2011. Consistent with our 3-year strategic plan, we're sustaining high returns in our North America segment and building momentum in our International segment, as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. In Q1, our North American business segment reported revenues of $552 million and sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 41%. While storage revenue gains remained solid at 2%, overall North America growth was constrained by lower service revenues including the impact of lower recycled paper prices. ","We continue to drive operational improvements in North America to offset these impacts and maintain our high returns in this business. Our International segment continues to post solid constant dollar revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. As noted, adjusted OIBDA increased 15% excluding FX impacts, yielding 200 basis points of margin expansion. We're benefiting from the expansion of operational excellence initiatives in markets like Latin America, and from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets as part of our portfolio improvement plan. Benefits from these initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International business is keeping us on track towards our business plan goals of 25% margins in 2013. Corporate expenses were consistent with prior year levels including $2 million of costs related to the work of the special committee.","Overall, we're delivering consistent solid operating performance across our business, which is driving sustained strong cash flow. This performance is supporting significant shareholder payouts.","Let's turn to Slide 7 to review our stockholder payout program. Slide 7 shows the substantial progress we've made in returning funds to stockholders over the past 2 years. Since first announcing our plans to return cash to shareholders in February of 2010, we returned $1.4 billion to stockholders through $300 million of dividend payments and the repurchase of 38 million shares for more than $1.1 billion. In Q1, we acquired 1.1 million shares for $35 million. Share repurchases to date, through this program, represent more than 18% of the shares we had outstanding at the end of 2009. As part of our 3-year strategic plan that we presented in April of 2011, we committed to $2.2 billion of payouts through 2013, including $1.2 billion by May 2012. We've completed our initial $1.2 billion commitment and we're well-positioned to continued advancement of shareholder payouts supported by our strong operating performance. We remain committed to driving strong cash flows and driving an optimal approach to our capital structure to support shareholder returns.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review how we're managing our balance sheet to fund our business and drive our strategy. Strong consistent cash flow generation has enabled us to maintain a strong balance sheet while supporting substantial shareholder payouts. As planned, we recently increased our leverage by approximately 1\/2 a turn in support of our payout program. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is 3.5x at the midpoint of our target 3x to 4x leverage range. We remain well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $700 million with $178 million in cash and $529 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our debt portfolio at March 31, 2012 also remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was down to 6.7%, and we were 80% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is more than 6 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our 3-year plan, and we're well-positioned to fund our business strategy.","That concludes our review for Q1 2012 results. Overall, we continue to drive solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our goals in 2012, as we continue to advance our 3-year plan. ","Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our 2012 outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our current 2012 outlook. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2012 financial guidance and adding the impact of the store acquisition in Brazil. As a result of the store acquisition, we're increasing our revenue outlook by $25 million. There will be no impact on adjusted OIBDA as operating profits will be offset by integration expenses in 2012. As noted, we're planning for consistent revenue growth trends excluding impacts from recent declines in recycled paper prices. Supported by consistent storage internal growth of about 3%, we're expecting constant dollar revenue growth of 2% to 4%, excluding paper. ","As noted, our internal growth outlook x paper impacts remains at 1% to 3%. A 30% decline in paper prices compared to the average for 2011 and negative year-on-year impacts from foreign exchange is projected to reduce our reported growth to a range of minus 1% to plus 2%. Our outlook for constant currency adjusted OIBDA growth, excluding the impact of lower paper prices, remains between 1% and 5%. At current levels, lower paper prices are projected to have a negative 5% impact on our adjusted OIBDA growth this year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.36 per share. Our calculation of adjusted EPS assumes the structural tax rate of 39% and 172 million shares outstanding. We're planning for capital spending of $220 million including $5 million associated with the store acquisition and about $25 million of spending for real estate. Our outlook is for free cash flow performance -- our outlook for free cash flow performance remains in the range of $320 million to $360 million including about $20 million of negative impacts this year from higher prior year capital spending accruals. Finally, based on our outlook for 2012, we expect our return on invested capital to be in the range of 11%.","In summary, Q1 as was another quarter of solid financial performance and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2012. We continue to execute against our 3-year plan, completing our $1.2 billion payout commitment, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we're well-positioned to build on this progress. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to ask about core services. We're flat now. We've been flat for 2 quarters. The forecast for the year is unchanged at negative 4 to 0. I surely heard that you had a couple of things moving around there and that activities, meaning moving boxes around, is still dead, at least in North America. But why after being flat this quarter and flat in the fourth quarter, is the forecast for the year kind of unchanged to be -- being 0 to minus 4? The very least, you would feel better about the high end of that.","Brian P. McKeon","Well, as you know, it's early in the year, Andrew, and we are within the range. I think there is always noise on those type of numbers at the margin. As Richard said, we're off to a good start to the year. We feel good about the track that we're on and...","C. Richard Reese","We don't like to predict things we don't see for sure either, Andrew, but basically, we didn't focus on making a change there. It's in the range.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And maybe let me just ask the question one more time. Is the flat, the 0, more a function of how strong hybrid is? Or has there been some improvement, meaning less negative in terms of moving stuff around?","Brian P. McKeon","A couple of things. We're getting about 1 point benefit from fuel surcharges. It helps a little bit. The -- it's more similar trends than different trends. I think our International business is doing well, and I think the activity trends in International are relatively stronger than what we've seen in North America. I think North America has been a very similar place. We do record, as you know, some of the hybrid revenues through the -- we record some of that in our core service, the more recurring nature where we have more recurring projects, and that's a double-digit growth. We're doing very well on that front. So that's [indiscernible]. But on balance, more similar than different, but I think we do have some positives.","C. Richard Reese","And Andrew, the International business is much less of its portfolio has any in healthcare in it. And healthcare is the major drag factor in North America.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of James Samford with Citigroup.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to, I guess if I could just follow-up on that a little bit. If you could just sort of frame the activity cycle in terms of the macro environment, I'm just sort of curious whether activity internationally is a function of -- if there's a lot of changes going on there and that's sort of driving activity levels. I just want to sort of frame it on from a macro perspective.","C. Richard Reese","Yes. Look, no. I think International is more driven by the 7% storage growth, and that drags along with it more services. Newer records are far more active, and they age fairly quickly in terms of activity patterns. So the faster you grow on them, the greater the amount of newer records you got, and therefore the more active they are. And plus part of that activity is the charges of bringing things in, so if you're growing faster, you got more service activity to assess or bring things in. No, I don't think it's an economic impact. Although services have -- do respond to the economy quicker than storage. Storage growth is a real lag on an economic rebound. And like in North America, we've seen no real clear trends in the economy. And we expect to be an 18-month or so lagger there. On services, we would pick up a little faster.","Brian P. McKeon","What's tough for us parse, too, is just obviously, the first quarter in North America, you had better weather. And I think when weather is bad, you hear about the negative side of it. When it's good, no one's saying that's helping to support performance. But that could be at the margin. Something is helping us a bit. I don't -- to Rich's point, I don't think we've seen kind of a change in the economic environment. It's more reflective of kind of what's going on underlying it.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a quick follow up on -- it looks like volume growth picked up a little bit here. You got stabilization on the output and distractions. I think the organic piece, is that International organic? Or how should we think about sort of the mix of volume growth on the Records Management side?","Brian P. McKeon","It's very, again, very similar. I think you're looking at our encashment where we show kind of the quarterly numbers annualized. It's very similar in the U.S., kind of flat volume trends. We're seeing benefits from the sales and marketing initiatives that we advanced and that's helping us to stabilize the incoming volume, which was down a bit. And now, it's more in the stable zone in which we feel very good about. And international is in a similar zone of solid growth. There is some seasonality in the quarterly numbers. We do tend to see more add lots in the first quarter, and so when you seasonal-ize those numbers, that's part of the dynamic you see there, but it's a similar trend. We feel good that we've moved from where we had more pressure on our growth to where we're more stable and seeing positive flowthrough from some of the investments, and looking forward to building on that.","C. Richard Reese","And that we spoke a little bit about the investment sales and market. It's a long cycle to see it come through. But we're seeing better performance. We're seeing better pipeline growth. We're seeing better conversion ratios. We're seeing a variety of things that make us feel like we've kind of pulled out of the bottom and we started back in another direction. But it's very, very slow cycle. And I really caution people that this is not a business that you can take sort of a data point and sort of draw line up or line down. It's a flywheel, it takes a while that move either way. But I think we feel like it's moving in a better direction now than it was moving in say, a year's plus or so ago. But I would -- again caution you, don't go re-forecasting things. You'll be absolutely wrong.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Richard, did you tend to talk about a kind of a longer-term trend on the storage side in terms of revenue growth? And was it low single-digits, or was that within storage itself? Or just -- can you put some context around that?","C. Richard Reese","Yes. What I'm really saying is I think we can keep our business overall growing in those ranges but build on a foundation of storage, annuity-based kinds of businesses in effect. And we're going through some shifts and changes. We've talked about healthcare restructuring itself. Look our healthcare business is growing, but the big service component is coming out of it, it was our most active business. It will take a while take for them to absorb. I know people believe that, that foreshadows what's going happen in the rest of the market. They're wrong. Not that -- we have records aren't going to get less active. Like we've announced, we have been doing that for 30 years, and they will for over the next 30, 40 years. But not at the same pace as healthcare. But we've got those headwinds, and those headwinds of healthcare will take a while for us to eat through, but we've got a bunch of other positive things and we got some new things in the hopper. And if we look out over the long haul, and we've done quite a bit of work on this and look at a very long period of time, what we're saying is we believe net-net, we have the opportunity set, and we have the tools, staying within our core business, not going throwing big, long passes or anything. Staying with that core business to keep the core -- keep our business, all annuity-based by and large, growing in the low single-digits. And that's why we talk a lot about confidence around the ability to sustain the flywheel and sustain the cash generation capabilities of the business.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Understood. And then just -- it seems like on a relative basis, acquisitions are starting to pick up a little bit. Is that just purely opportunity? Kind of how you're feeling about the business overall? Or just any thoughts on that?","C. Richard Reese","I have been saying around here for a couple of years that we're going to see -- if we're going to see another mini consolidation wave in North America and like everything else I predicted, it takes a long time for it to happen. That's our business. It's starting to happen. That is the nature in North America of just the -- the impact of the first consolidation wave was to consolidate the market, create a bunch of new competitors. Now, there's new competitors. We have a reasonable number of them. I have been out there a while, invested capital for a long time, and looking to monetize. It's just the cycle. I think we'll go through that cycle again. And we will play that opportunity cycle because unlike the last time when we were a driver of that cycle, we were building footprint. This time, we're not building footprint. We're building returns, and we're going to do it by -- if it's a great consolidation economics and it's a good, clean business, in a fair price to both parties, we'll do it. If it's not, we'll pass on it. And so on, okay? But we are in the market. But we want to make sure the market hears us that way, and if anybody's interested in selling, you can get my phone number, you know how to call, we'll talk to you. Now that's North America. International, although in certain parts of International, there's some of that same dynamic but a much smaller scale. The other part of International, it's about us being a bit more targeted around our strategy that says market leadership. Where we -- where there are great markets particularly those with lots of growth left. And yes, I've spoken before and now a lot of the emerging markets have a 20, 20 to 30-year cycle just like the North American and the mature European markets went through, of the one-time outsourcing decision that for customers to accumulate their existing records, to get it organized and move from inside to outside. That's the kind of a once-in-a-lifetime decision. And during that cycle, it takes a long time. It took us over 30 years in North America to physically move all those records and we only about halfway through it, okay. But that long cycle in the emerging markets and a good part of the International places like Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and so forth, is a very large business opportunity for us. And so we want to be market leaders in a good part of that space. We have leadership but quite a bit of it, but there are places where we don't. Brazil was a good example. And so internationally, we would be more targeted towards finding those place we can go ahead and achieve leadership, get to scale and ride that outsourcing conversion curve and then what we've been able to do on North America, build great returns and much bigger businesses. The International play gets a lot better over time. It just takes time for it to grow because each of those countries -- it's not like a foreign company -- country operation is not analogous to a city in North America. It's got a different overhead structure. It's got a different cultural bias. It's got a different way of selling. It's got variations. And the bigger you get, the better you get at adapting to those variations, the more efficient you get. There's just a lot of positive things come out of it. And like [indiscernible] fill out in our business, that takes patience. But now that we've done our portfolio review, we're in good shape. We're just going to keep adding to it. And so net-net, North America is more opportunistic strategy where the returns make sense. International is a more strategic M&A strategy where it is about driving leadership to drive returns.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Understood. And then just one final, if I could? Within the context of overall capital return, kind of M&A versus kind of dividend and buyback in aggregate, out of 100%, how would that play out over the next couple of years?","C. Richard Reese","Well, you're really talking the capital allocation strategy going forward, and I'm not going to comment on that because that just gets wrapped up into the whole issue of what we do next. And so we'll talk about that sometime between now and June 9.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","As I was going through the 10-K, one thing jumped out that maybe I'm making too big a deal out of. But it was interesting to me that on your cash flow statement, the portion of the customer acquisition costs that you capitalize, that addition to customer relationship\/acquisition cost line, it was larger in absolute terms than as a percent of revenue, than any point is better in the last 10 years, and yet -- revenue growth is pretty slow. I guess I wondered, is this may be another sign that the sales investments you've done are working? Or is there something that's changed that would be driving that, maybe like higher customer turnover, but you're doing a better job of adding to offset that or something?","Brian P. McKeon","We have a lot of tools in terms of how we build new business and in some cases, we will acquire business, what we call a pick-up-and-moves. So basically, we're acquiring businesses from competitors without necessarily taking the real estate...","C. Richard Reese","You'd be buying a portfolio of customers basically, and moving them into existing sites.","Brian P. McKeon","And that is an area where it's a similar judgment in terms of deploying capital and looking at returns, and we've had opportunities on their front, and that is an area that we'll continue to deploy to grow as well. And we understand the economics of those types of investments very, very well as you might imagine because it's clearly defined. And we can swab that into areas where we have excess capacity and help to manage our facility utilization. So that's what it's reflective of.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, I was thinking back to, I guess now, 1.5 year ago, your last investor day, and I remember one of the themes of that, that was a focus on where you could be more targeted in trying to get pricing? Has there been any change in that? Or is it sort of the economy where it is, and not having gotten better enough, kept you from making any major moves towards that strategy you talked about?","C. Richard Reese","Well, we restructured pricing in not all of our business, but a reasonable amount of our business in over the last say, 3 years or so, where we went to more list price and then discount off a list and try to rationalize pricing, and looked across the board at the value proposition, and so forth. That would be the sort of the, what you might call a big move in effect of things. And since then, if you think about it, we have a significant part of our revenue where it's a sort of on an annual cycle and we're going through those annual increases. But we also have a significant part of revenue that's on multi-year contracts that are indexed by-and-large, one way or the other inflation. But in the last few years, those indexes have been down and so that puts a limit on just the natural limit on price. The flip side of it is, if you believe we will see inflation in the future, we'll be well-protected on the way back up. So...","Brian P. McKeon","Strategically, we're increasing our focus on being more segmented in our offering by a customer vertical and looking across the scope of the services that we offer and linking that into our pricing strategy. So I think we're looking for ways to increase the value that we bring to customers and capture that through the pricing strategies. That's really the next wave. Building on what Richard said, I think we've got a very good foundational structure for how we approach pricing and are advancing the same strategy, and trying to look at ways to increase our value add through segmented approaches to growth. And that will be the next wave and where we might be able to get some incremental value out of our pricing approach.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last one. Everybody's noticed that Brambles didn't sell recall at the price or the timing they wondered -- they wanted to. I wondered if you had any comment if that would be something that might make sense as something for Iron Mountain to look at? Or maybe would be willing to say if you have not really been involved in that or not?","C. Richard Reese","We have not been in the process. I think, it was Brambles' choice. It's not that we wouldn't have been interested in looking because we would have. If I think for their own reasons, and probably good reasons, they chose that -- not to bring us into the process. So we're are sitting on the sidelines and watching like everybody else.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Co.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm just curious on the pick-up-and-moves. I'm just curious if you can just talk about, quantify how much of the volume growth you're seeing is as a result that today, and given that it just sounds like this is a little bit of a shift there, and kind of what was it maybe a few years ago?","Brian P. McKeon","You said a relatively similar range. I think it's less than 1% on the margin. I do think we're increasing our focus across a number of areas, including acquisitions in terms of growth. But I don't think it's a fundamental change from where we've been. We'll take a closer look at that. But it does go up and down depending on the nature of the opportunities that are out there. And I think we've seen a better pipeline more recently. This just tie into some of the themes that's Richard's talking about with -- in North America, more things being available for sale. This is a -- in many ways, a different form of the sale for smaller businesses.","C. Richard Reese","And we -- as we go forward, we will use various tools that keep the drive and the sustainability of the business. As a company, the theme we said is, for this year and for our 3-year plan, is to refocus back on our core physical business. The reason we stated it that way is, looking prior to that, and it's not that we lost focus on the business, but there's a few tools we had put down and just weren't using, and this is one of them. We just -- we were not looking at any form or fashion to speak of -- particularly North America, the opportunity set that came up. And so we're just opening up and looking at those sort of things.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Makes sense. And just on the service business, Richard, are there any knobs that you have on your arsenal to maybe induce some level services there? Is there a pricing strategy that maybe lines up the marginal costs and marginal revenues there better? Or is there anything you're doing today to maybe offset some of the headwinds you're seeing there?","C. Richard Reese","There are some new services that we have introduced, and they're getting traction. But like everything, they take a long time. I mean, that's the good and bad side of our business. What I'm -- for example in the healthcare space is an approach to pathology customers. It's -- we've repackaged and come up with a better value proposition, and we're getting good traction on it. But it takes a few years before you see any major impact under that. So we're doing things like that, and it's more about the theme of vertical-izing our services and being much more specific around specific industry needs. And we had some other new service programs or new product programs related to our core in what I'd call beta phases. We're not going to pound a table on them for a while until they turn real, but yes, some of them look very promising, and some could be substantial big businesses over time. And so rather than coming out and hyping them, what we're going to do is go through some betas and get into the markets a little bit. And when we have some real results that's significant, we'll come back to talk to you about them, and so forth. And that's all part of us maturing as a company, learning how to look across our own customer base, and we've been evolving those skills in project management-type skills, and so forth, to be able to verticalize, to be able to be more creative and look for opportunity sets and custom-design what we do and then repeat it over and over, and so forth. And we're getting better at that. We'll have to keep getting better at it, and that's where a reasonable amount of money has been invested in the last few years, and I think we'll continue doing that.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just kind of another one, just touching on -- in your sales process here a little bit. On the digital business, it's been out of your portfolio now for a while. Can you talk a little bit about kind of how the new relationship with your digital vendors is going, maybe what you've learned from that process? And maybe Brian, can you give us -- or quantify how much of revenue we're seeing today from you selling digital services that are not assets or technologies that you own?","Brian P. McKeon","That's a small number.","C. Richard Reese","It's a small number. We -- because we shifted 100% of the sales force that sold the technology services, and chose not to rebuild that sales force. Having said that though, we are selling a lot more connected [indiscernible].","Brian P. McKeon","It's a very small number. Immaterial.","C. Richard Reese","And what we did was is -- frankly, at the request of my leadership in North America, they asked me to slow down on doing that. Not slow down on selling it per se, but on focus because what they found was that they really wanted to get their sales force refocused and requoted back towards the core business. We had -- the quarters in focusing on very much towards the new services side. And that's one of the reasons that storage started to come off and by refocusing and making people focused on going back and digging out the storage, they're doing it. We just didn't want to confuse people.","Brian P. McKeon","We continue to own in the intellectual property management business, which is a great business for us, and it's roughly $30 million of revenues. So that was part of the digital business that was doing well.","C. Richard Reese","And we've -- look, we were coming back. Some of those the beta services talking to you have a strong partner technology component potential. But we're going to take our time, and we're not going to spend a god-awful amount of money trying to do this stuff.","So I think that's the last question, operator, in my understanding. So -- hey, I was right, we finished 5 minutes earlier, so that's a record for me. So thank you very much. As I said, the business is performing as we expected. We're off to a good start for the quarter, and hopefully, the rest of the calls this year will be equally good if not better, and so forth. We are really busy though. There's a lot going on between, I'd like to say looking at an acquisition pipeline and looking at -- and so forth. But the real focus of the, some of the organization, is on being prepared to have a conversation with you prior to June 9. And I know everybody's eager to hear us talk and we will be prepared, and we'll let you know, probably the day of or some number of, when we come forth and talk. So we look forward to talking to you again in the next couple of months. Thank you very much for your support, and we will talk to you later.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv. Please go ahead.","Greer Aviv","Thank you, Chuck. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that will be referred today, in today\u2019s prepared remarks, are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today\u2019s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information.","On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain\u2019s President and CEO, who will discuss third quarter performance and Project Summit, the transformation program announced this morning. Stuart Brown, our CFO, will then cover additional financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today\u2019s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance and expectations from Project Summit.","All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Meaney","Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. On today\u2019s call, I would like to cover two main topics. First, we delivered another solid quarter showing adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis, further demonstrating the strong and consistent organic growth we are building in the businesses as well as continued progression in the year.","Second, we announced Project Summit, which is a transformation program we are commencing in November that will leave us with a simpler and more dynamic management structure, better supporting our future.","Before we get into our discussion of the Q3 results, I will first address Project Summit. At a high level, this transformation program focuses on three key areas. First, we will simplify our global structure by combining our core Records and Information Management or RIM operations under one global leader, whilst also eliminating unnecessary work in rebalancing resources.","Second, by simplifying our global organization, we will streamline our support structure, whereby we will condense the number of layers and reporting levels from our current average of 6 levels, down to 4 levels. This will create a more dynamic agile organization.","And third, we will more efficiently leverage our global and regional customer-facing resources across RIM product lines, creating better alignment between new digital solutions in our core business, resulting in an enhanced customer experience.","All in all, Project Summit is expected to deliver $200 million in annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits with all actions expected to be complete by the end of 2021. We expect to incur total restructuring cost to achieve these benefits of $240 million. Of the total benefit, $50 million will be implemented during the course of November and December, with a restructuring cost of approximately $60 million being recognized in the fourth quarter.","Whilst there will be little to no benefit from this first phase of Summit in our 2019 results, benefits are expected to start flowing through in the first quarter of 2020 on top of our normal growth.","Before diving into more detail on Summit, let me provide some context. Over the course of Iron Mountain\u2019s nearly 7 decade history, we have developed unmatched trust and scale. We have built the global player in the Records and Information Management business today, storing nearly 700 million cubic feet of records with extremely deep customer relationships, including 95% of the Fortune 1000.","This global growth, which has in large part been executed through acquisitions, has resulted in certain complexities in areas such as business processes, IT systems, lines of accountability, decision making and other redundancies across our organization.","To be able to compete most effectively in any industry today, you must be flexible, have efficient lines of communication and be able to react quickly to evolving customer needs. We have heard from our customers that we need to be more integrated in our approach to solving their problems. This means, tearing down our internal silos, equipping our teams with the necessary tools to better meet customer needs across our business offering, and continue to standardize, streamline and simplify our systems and processes.","But in order to take fully \u2013 and to fully take advantage of this significant opportunity, we also need to better align our resources and capabilities, so we have a more simplified and efficient operating model.","Whilst the underlying health of the business is solid as demonstrated by the 3% organic storage revenue growth year-on-year, we believe Summit will allow us to continue that momentum, so we can capitalize on future opportunities faster and more efficiently.","We expect Summit to enable us to better execute on our strategy, so we can continue to grow both in revenue and profit, whilst also generating more free cash flow. This improvement in financial results will come from furthering our position as the global leader in the Records and Information Management industry, as well as continued investment to build further scale in data centers and create digital solutions for our customers whilst reducing leverage.","Moreover, through Summit, we are simplifying our global structure with a view to provide an environment where people can work in a dynamic workplace, all whilst identifying and vigorously pursuing the highest potential opportunities to serve our customers. In doing so, we will undertake steps to improve the efficiency of our operations and increase the pace at which we are able to affect change.","And our operations and cost structure will be better positioned allowing us to sharpen our focus on higher growth areas that can provide solid returns to our investors and enable us to enhance the strong customer relationships we already have across the enterprise.","As I mentioned earlier, key catalyst for this change, both from a customer service viewpoint as well as an operating efficiency standpoint is to place all of RIM under a single global leader. To this end, we are proud to announce that Ernie Cloutier, our International EVP and General Manager, will now lead global RIM operations in our new structure.","As we mentioned in this morning\u2019s announcement, Patrick Keddy will be retiring as EVP and General Manager of North America and Western Europe. Patrick is a seasoned executive who had led developed markets for several years and he will take on a consultative role, assisting Ernie, during the transition into his new role and provide support to Iron Mountain through the beginning of 2021.","We are extremely grateful to both Patrick and Ernie for their leadership and efforts to position the RIM business for sustained success under a united structure.","In addition to Ernie taking on this expanded role, he will be supported by Greg McIntosh, who is now charged with establishing and leading our commercial operations along with Strategic Accounts. Strategic Accounts is a relatively new area for Iron Mountain as we upgrade our ability to grow and service some of our highest potential customers.","In addition to Greg, Ernie will be supported by Deirdre Evens, who leads the North American RIM business. Additionally, Deirdre will report to me, leading the continued development of consumer storage, which includes our partnership with MakeSpace.","In terms of transforming the company to be more agile and dynamic to the benefit of our employees and customers, we will condense the number of layers and reporting levels which is expected to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%, including the impact of these reductions, approximately 75% of which will be actioned during the next two months.","The program is expected to reduce our total managerial and administrative workforce by 700 positions over the next two years. It should be noted that Summit is causing us to say goodbye to many friends and colleagues.","We are now in a situation that we need far fewer senior leaders if we are to serve our customers in a more responsive way. We are committed to providing the right support to these employees that it negatively impacted including appropriate severance and outplacement support.","Iron Mountain is a close-knit community. So it is never easy to part ways with team members, but the needs of our business continue to evolve and this realignment will prove to be value-enhancing for our organization, our team, our customers and shareholders over the long term.","Turning now to Q3 performance, we delivered constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.7% and 5% year-over-year respectively. This has resulted in a 120 basis points expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin to 35.4%, reflecting the benefits of revenue management and lower overhead costs, as well as the positive impact from the efficiency initiatives we began work on earlier this year, offsetting lower recycled paper prices.","Turning to business performance, Global Records Management volume trends continue to be positive with net organic volume increasing by more than 3 million cubic feet or 40 basis points over the last 12 months. This was driven by modest improvement in new sales, whilst destructions were in line with Q2 levels.","In developed markets, volume declined organically by about 3.5 million cubic feet or 70 basis points. More specifically, declines in North America RIM volume are in line with prior quarter, down 1.2%, while Western Europe grew organic volume by 1.5%.","Other International net organic volume increased by 6.6 million cubic feet or 3.6%, a modest acceleration from previous quarters as new sales growth was strong and destructions moderated.","We remain encouraged by the resilience and durability of our core records management business, and believe unifying the RIM organization under 1 global structure will result in unlocking incremental opportunity in the core business and beyond. We will better align resources across the RIM organization to both to bolster our customer experience, globalized processes and extend our reach beyond our core records management offering.","For example, the North American RIM team has been successful and leveraging our assets to grow non-core storage opportunities in the area such as consumer, library services and other channel relationships contributing more than 3 million cubic feet year-to-date to our storage portfolio.","We continue to make good progress in penetrating some of the historically unvended segments of the North American markets including the federal government. Our federal team had its best quarter yet in Q3 with revenue growing double-digits year-over-year with solid wins across multiple product lines, including core storage, shred, IGDS or Information Governance and Digital Solutions and data center. This is a great example of the sell all culture we are driving toward.","Our IGDS business is showing strong year-over-year growth with a focus on increasing the contribution from recurring revenues, we have seen good success with our digital solutions increasingly enabling the pull-through of other revenue opportunities across multiple product lines allowing us to engage with customers on a different level, when addressing a more comprehensive solution that meets their evolving business needs.","Just 1 example of this was a recent $4 million win, including scanning some 250,000 cubic feet of documents, where we combined our insight platform with our digitization capabilities. It was this unique offering, which compelled this engineering customer to choose us.","Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our growth trajectory across our Global Data Center platform. Q3 was a busy quarter with new turnkey data center capacity brought online in key markets around the world, including Phoenix, London, Amsterdam and Singapore. In addition to the hyperscale lease we signed in the critical Northern Virginia market in early Q3, we are encouraged by the retail-focused enterprise demand we see as evidenced by a growing pipeline.","Looking at data center leasing activity in Q3 more specifically, we signed 8 megawatts of new and expansion leases, primarily driven by the lease in Northern Virginia. Excluding that we signed 2 megawatts driven entirely by enterprise demand with nearly 75% of the kilowatts attributable to new logos to the Iron Mountain data center platform. Through the end of the third quarter, we have leased a total of 15.2 megawatts and continue to expect to achieve the high-end of our 2019 target of 15 to 20 megawatts.","As we have shared with you on previous quarters, a clear differentiator for Iron Mountain in the data center space is our strong brand recognition and the power of our ability to leverage customer relationships of our traditional sales force.","In summary, Q3 was a solid quarter, which highlights the continued durability and stability of the core Records and Information Management business whilst demonstrating the growth opportunities available to us in faster growing markets and businesses. Once implemented, Project Summit will simplify our day-to-day operations and enable us to move faster and ease our ability to capture growth opportunities and execute on our stated strategic priorities through building a stronger, more nimble organization that enhances our service to customers and generate solid returns for all stakeholders.","I should add also today, we announced a 1.2% increase in our dividend to $2.47 per share on an annual basis. We are continuing to grow our dividend albeit at a more modest space given the solid pipeline of data center investment opportunities we see ahead in 2020. Durable provide more financial details for Q3 as well as the impact of Project Summit, both near and longer term. Stuart?","Stuart Brown","Thank you, Bill. We have a lot to cover today, so let me jump in. Before reviewing business performance and outlook, I want to give you some perspective on Project Summit in the impact on our longer-term financial framework, a framework showing our plan to generate more cash flow to fund our growth investments and an increasing dividend over the long term. The benefits of the structural transformation we announced this morning are expected to expand over the next several years, helping to fund significant opportunities to create value by investing in both our physical storage and data center businesses.","Looking out, we expect our storage business to continue to exhibit as consistent and durable characteristics, and see strong demand for data center capacity resulting in low-single-digit annual organic storage rental revenue growth. Service revenue, while more lumpy in nature, should remain flattish as declining core services are offset by new customer solutions.","The revenue growth and ongoing continues improvement initiatives should grow adjusted EBITDA organically and consistently around 4% or approximately $60 million per year. Project Summit will continue to help drive higher AFFO, generating increasingly more cash flow. As Bill noted, with Project Summit we intend to invest in higher growth opportunities including data center development and continued scaling of our international operations, while simplifying how we operate.","Our strategic priorities and capital allocation plans remain unchanged, as we continue to leverage our global leadership and records management and information governance as well as our enterprise relationships. We will continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation decisions, balancing investments that create value for shareholders, while providing more solutions for our 225,000 customers.","The framework demonstrates our commitment to fund the majority of our growth to robust free cash flow, and in turn, reduced leverage. As we grow AFFO, we plan to operate with lease adjusted leverage in the range of 4.5 to 5 times [EBITDAR] [ph], depending upon where we are in the cycle and with our dividend payout ratio more in line with data center and other faster growing REITs.","Now turning to quarterly results, we generated revenues of nearly $1.1 billion in Q3. Total reported revenue grew 10 basis points or 1.7% excluding the impact of the stronger dollar. As you can see on Slide 8, our total storage rental revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis in Q3 driven by organic storage rental revenue growth of 3%, reflecting results from revenue management and global volume growth. More specifically, developed markets organic storage revenue was 2.3% for the quarter, reflecting continuing contributions from revenue management and volumes trends that were largely consistent with Q2.","In the Other International segment, we continue to achieve healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.5%. In data center, organic storage revenue growth was 4.1% in Q3, a little lower than previous quarters with churn of 2.4% matching the expectations we had messaged last quarter. Our Adjacent Businesses were also performing well, growing organic storage revenue by 5.2% in the quarter.","Total service revenue declined 2.1% in constant currencies with organic service revenue down 3% in the quarter compared to growth of 7.1% a year ago. This change mainly reflects the swing in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of last year and are currently less than half of those levels. If we exclude the $13.8 million impact of lower year-over-year paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 20 basis points in Q3, which is below recent trends due mainly to lower project revenue in our international markets.","We now expect annual organic service revenue to decline approximately 1.5%, while annual storage organic growth is expected to generate \u2013 to increase about 2.5% resulting in total organic revenue growth around 1%. Remember that generating gross margins of 74%, storage remains the key driver of our profitability.","As you can also see on Slide 8, third quarter SG&A declined about $16 million from a year ago, reflecting cost management actions as well as lower variable compensation compared to a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA increased $13 million year-over-year or 3.7% to $376 million, despite the lower paper prices. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA increased $18 million or 5%.","AFFO in the third quarter was $225 million compared to $227 million a year ago. This decrease is primarily attributable to $9 million of higher maintenance in non-real estate growth investments, including the completion of the number of recent shredding plant upgrades to reduce transportation costs to improve capacity. Slide 10 details adjusted EBITDA margin performance by business segment. In total, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.4%.","Turning to Slide 11, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio of 5.8 times remains in line with other REITs and was flat to Q2. We expect leverage to remain flattish through the end of the year held back by lower paper prices and exchange rates as well as the cost of implementing Project Summit ahead of our benefits flowing next year.","Importantly, we opened the crossover debt market in early September, raising $1 billion of 10-year bonds at 4.875%, an offering that was 3 times oversubscribed. We use the proceeds to pay down borrowers under our credit facility, which in turn extend our average maturity to 6 years. Further, we have good line of sight to exceeding $100 million in net capital recycling proceeds from the sale of real estate this year after having closed on 2 purchase options in Northern California and selling a portfolio of Midwest properties in Q3.","Turning to 2019 guidance on Slide 12, while our core storage and records management business has been strong, this year has had some headwinds that we are not fully anticipated when we laid out the guidance. This includes, of course, paper prices which will impact adjusted EBITDA by almost $30 million for the full year. To a lesser degree, we experienced lower growth in project revenue \u2013 project service revenue than we\u2019d expected. But we have successfully implemented a number of cost savings initiatives. They\u2019ve only partially offset these challenges.","We expect Q4 EBITDA to be up slightly from our performance in Q3 with little to no benefit from Project Summit in the quarter. This is below previous growth expectations due partly to lower service results in developed markets. As a result, we now expect fully year adjusted EBITDA to be near the low-end of our previous guidance or a range between $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion, with this change flowing through to AFFO and adjusted EPS. This implies year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of constant currencies of 2% to 3%. While we will provide formal 2020 guidance in February with our Q4 earnings call, given the size and impact of Project Summit, we want to provide some important components to help in modeling.","At a high-level, we expect organic adjusted EBITDA growth to continue to be about 4% year-over-year or approximately $60 million. Incremental to our normal organic adjusted EBITDA growth, we should see $50 million of benefit from Project Summit actions taken in 2019 and $30 million of in-year benefit from Summit actions taken in 2020, which will be second half weighted.","In addition, current paper prices and exchange rates indicate $25 million to $30 million of headwinds, relative to results anticipated for full year 2019. Putting this altogether, we would expect to see a year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million.","Also, we plan to treat the cost to implement Project Summit as restructuring, which will be excluded from our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. To conclude, the transformation program that we announced today is expected to yield significant benefits as we simplify how we do business, bringing value to shareholders and to our customers.","Implementing this program provides a clear path to delivery of our strategic priorities, including generating cash flow to fund our growth, while helping ensure that Iron Mountain\u2019s position as the trusted guardian of its customers\u2019 most precious assets is protected for years to come.","We look forward to sharing our progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. With that, Chuck, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you to open up the line for Q&A.","We will now begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Nate Crossett","Hi, good morning. I\u2019m curious to get your sense of how the $200 million in annual cost saves will be allocated, I guess, just in terms of how you\u2019re viewing growth projects like data centers versus, say, deleveraging, what\u2019s the kind of breakout of uses?","William Meaney","So first of all, the Project Summit is totally driven in terms of reorganizing the company, so that we\u2019re simpler to work with from the customer standpoint and it allows our mountaineers to work more efficiently and quicker with less obstacles internally. So it\u2019s really about reorganizing the way we do things rather than businesses that we\u2019re conducting. So they\u2019re quite separate in that sense.","So if you think about overall in terms of the project is as we said that $50 million will be actioned over the next 2 months. And that\u2019s \u2013 the big change in the feeling of the company will be in terms of the way when we change kind of the leadership hierarchy of the company. So that first $50 million, 40 \u2013 is about really getting us 75% of the way in terms of getting what I would call the top of the house structured in a way that\u2019s going to make us more efficient to both interact with our customers as well as to action things internally on their behalf, because that\u2019s really looking at 45% of the changes or 45% reduction in our VPs and above.","So that\u2019s really the first $50 million of change. And then what we talked about was the $30 million of in-year benefit on top of that $50 million for the 2020 guidance. That equates to about $70 million worth of action of the $200 million program. So by the end of 2020 will be up to around $120 million of cost improvement of a $200 million program.","So that\u2019s how the things sequence. But they\u2019re very separate from our investment data center. Data center, we continue to see strong growth as both Stuart and I highlighted. If you think about it this year is we\u2019re up about 10% since the beginning of the year in terms of leased capacity.","And if you normalize for the churn that we talked about on the last quarter call, which was known when we bought IO; then we\u2019re up about \u2013 we\u2019re up in mid-teens in terms of year-on-year growth in terms of leases that we\u2019ve actioned and brought into online. And then if you look going forward in 2020 is we gave guidance that would be 15 to 20 megawatts that we would book this year. And at the end of the third quarter we\u2019re up a little over 15 megawatts.","So again, quite \u2013 yeah, consistent with our guidance that we continue to expect to be able to grow data center between 15% and 20% a year. So \u2013 but it\u2019s very separate from Project Summit. Project Summit is really about reorganizing it, so we can be more effective.","Nate Crossett","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, just maybe on the DCs since you talked about it a lot. There is obviously been a lot of chatter in this space in terms of M&A. Just curious to get your thoughts on whether you guys continue to look at opportunities from time to time and what your appetite is to maybe accelerate that DC build-out as a percent of the overall EBITDA of the company, because it is a higher growth area.","William Meaney","I agree with you, Nate. But also a lot of these acquisitions are pretty pricy. And fundamentally, when we\u2019re looking at capital allocation, it can\u2019t be just about bulking up. It needs to be a good allocation of capital and it needs to be accretive on both earnings or an EPS as well as an AFFO per share basis.","So we\u2019re pretty disciplined on looking at that. We feel really good about the acquisitions we done today. Obviously, the IO being the larger of the ones, which was about \u2013 it\u2019s much about building a platform. But I think now we really have been able to build up the platform and attract the talent that we need to lead that.","So I don\u2019t anticipate us doing any major acquisitions. I mean, there are what I would call smaller acquisitions like what we did with EvoSwitch in Amsterdam, which is close to \u2013 those types of acquisitions, when you pencil them out, are close to or near the same cost as it would be cost to build, right? So if there is an acquisition where we think the economics would give us similar cost as a cost of building it, allow us to action quicker into the market, we will do that. But I don\u2019t see us doing any major acquisitions just to bulk up.","Nate Crossett","Okay. And then, maybe just one last quick one, organic storage growth 3%, looks like that\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been since 1Q 2018. Just wanted to get your sense of how sustainable that 3% market is going forward. How far along are you in that revenue management initiative you put in place and how much runway do you have on that piece of it going forward?","William Meaney","Yeah, we feel \u2013 it\u2019s a great question. We feel really good about it. And exactly, really the two drivers, one is the revenue management now is rolled out globally. So we see that there is still more runway in terms of continuing to get more out of revenue management across all the business lines. And I would say it\u2019s rolled out globally for RIM. But we\u2019re also expanding it to some of our other business lines in terms of the non-RIM. But \u2013 and some of those are storage and some of those aren\u2019t.","I think the other aspect in terms of volume, we\u2019re continuing to encourage in terms of the growth that we see in the international markets, and even in North American market, where we see slightly negative headwinds in terms of volume what I would call in the traditional records management business. I think I highlighted in my remarks that year to date, Deirdre and her team have actually brought in about $3 million of non-traditional storage, which has similar returns as our box business.","So we see also some of the new areas of storage. So net-net, you put it altogether, is we feel really comfortable to be kind of maintaining in this kind of zip-code for our organic storage revenue growth.","Nate Crossett","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","Yes, good morning. Bill, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more description on Project Summit. After the Recall acquisition, you did have significant cost savings initiative. How does this project compare to that? And did you engage outside consultants for the analysis?","William Meaney","Okay. It\u2019s a great question. So the \u2013 so let me kind of \u2013 let me back up in terms of \u2013 I think your question, the other question is the catalyst for this. Is that the \u2013 first of all, when we looked at \u2013 at some point, we knew that we wanted to bring our records management under a single business unit globally. And I think the timing first of all is right for that. So that was the primary catalyst.","And you say, well, why is the timing right to bring records management together into a single business unit now? For those of you who\u2019ve been following this story for a while, six or seven years ago, when we started on this journey, is emerging markets were only 10% of our sales as a company and it\u2019s now approaching 20%.","We originally set our goal to get that to be 15%. Now, it\u2019s approaching 20%. And it was important to have a separate, a near separate leadership if we wanted to be able to make sure that we are allocating capital in a thoughtful way in getting the returns we needed as we built out that footprint. And both is through one-off acquisitions as well as the Recall acquisition. We feel really good. First of all, we doubled the size of our footprint effectively in those markets. So we feel really good in terms of what Marc Duale and now Ernie and his team has been able to do. That\u2019s point one.","So now we actually do have the scale internationally, so having the, what I would call, separate and siloed focus to execute that, is for sure what\u2019s necessary. On top of that is we talked about earlier this year and we talked again today, we have been hearing more and more from our customers, both internal and external.","We have \u2013 our employees are telling us how difficult it is to get things done internally sometimes on behalf of a customer. But also, customers are looking for us to show up with integrated solutions seamlessly across the geographies they operate in. And we started setting up a strategic accounts organization under Greg McIntosh earlier this year.","We put those two together. We knew that we had to simplify, first of all, the organization by bringing Ernie\u2019s organization together with Patrick\u2019s onto a single leadership. The timing being quite good, because Patrick\u2019s intention to retire in early 2021. We thought now was the time to bring those 2 organizations together. When we brought those 2 organizations together, there is a bunch of costs that just naturally flows out, because you don\u2019t have 2 support functions, supporting 2 different business units. You now have 1 support function serving a single business unit.","And we wanted to make sure we took that opportunity to look through the organization completely, especially service part of the organization on how we could actually operate the business differently. So starting in January, if we are taking out 45% of the vice presidents and above as a result of this amalgamation and change, which was the catalyst to relook at the organization. This gave us an opportunity and we think, in terms, of the people who can be around the executive leadership team now. It will be a bigger and more inclusive group, but it will be smaller than the numbers we have before.","So our ability to actually communicate strategic intent into action request on customers will be much faster, because we can get more \u2013 we can get the right people around a single table to execute. So that\u2019s really the thing that\u2019s behind it. And then, the good news from a shareholder standpoint, when you do that kind of organizational efficiency, there\u2019s a lot of benefits that flow through.","The last thing, I\u2019ll talk about Summit, and I\u2019ll come to your question about advisers is the backend of the project of Summit is \u2013 the front end is really actioning, so by the end of this year, 75% of that reduction of the management cadre will basically be in place. As we go through the program over the next 2 years, is that we will start building new systems capabilities that allow to support that organization, which a lot of it is IT-led.","Last thing to your question on advisers. Actually, this is something that we\u2019ve been working on for a number of months, but when we got closer to the execution phase, we did bring advisers in the middle of August to make sure that we were actually executing in a way that was consistent and with speed. So we did bring in advisers and towards the tail end of the project.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Great. A couple of quick follow-ups. You mentioned this was customer driven, do you have to make any meaningful changes to your sales approach? And maybe for Stuart, where will we see these cost savings? Is it more in corporate G&A? Or will it be in segment margins?","William Meaney","Okay. Sheila, I\u2019ll take the sales, and then, Stuart can follow on your follow-on question. On the sales, you\u2019re absolutely, right. I mean, one of the things that we hear from the customer. Our customers and this is probably consisting a lot of industry, our customers are asking much more for solution oriented approach to them rather than selling them a product and a product might be digitization, a product might be box storage. And I highlighted the case where we won a project with an engineering company in Europe, where they had 250,000 cubic feet. It started out that they just wanted us to remove the 250,000 cubic feet and may be digitize some of them. And it turned out to be a project, where we really understood what they wanted.","We realize the combination of the insight platform to create \u2013 to automate the creation of more metadata as we actually digitize their boxes. And then they said, well actually we want everything digitized and the boxes will be destroyed. So it\u2019s an unvended opportunity. These boxes were stored in their facility. But by actually having a different sales team that\u2019s actually engaging them with a broad set of solutions, we were able to actually do more for our customers. And as a result, win a bigger and better project from an Iron Mountain standpoint.","So you\u2019re absolutely right, is that this allows us to actually collapse a lot of sales enablement \u2013 well, sales operations, sales enablement, strategic accounts and marketing will all be under Greg McIntosh, who actually is in Ernie\u2019s organization, so that we\u2019re delivering that our RIM customers. So there is a big part about it, in terms, of changing the way we go to market.","Stuart Brown","And Sheila, in terms of how the benefits will flow through, the actions that we are taking here in the fourth quarter, we talked about mostly people action so that will flow mostly through the SG&A line is where you\u2019ll see that. And then the actions we\u2019ve talked about that we\u2019re taking in 2020 are more around cost of sales are continued to be some SG&A improvement as well. And so you\u2019ll see that flow through more in the back half of 2020. And then when you think about sort of the flow through from there, right, in terms of the impact on our customers, as we rollout things like mobile customer tools, so we get fewer touch points between our customers ordering boxes or services or shredding or things like that, we\u2019re going to enable more mobile tools for our customers that have been asking for.","And actually simplify some of our billing as well that through the number of M&A acquisitions and things like that that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve got a number of manual processes around billings, which frustrates internally creates a lot of inefficiencies as well for our customers, it\u2019s not always easy for them. So those will flow through in various lines and that will continue to flow through within the later years.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Eric Luebchow","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Curious, Stuart, you mentioned that your net lease adjusted leverage were kind of remain flat throughout the year, but ultimately you wanted to get down to 4.5, 5 times range. So maybe you could kind of help us give a bridge for how you will get there and kind of the mix of EBITDA growth and\/or capital recycling and data center development CapEx? And how long you think it will kind of take to hit that target?","Stuart Brown","Yeah. Thanks, Eric. I think, if you look at what we talked about in our opening remarks, really, our aim is to grow our free cash flow to cover the majority investments, which were obviously, generating good returns on acquisitions and data center. And so our capital \u2013 deployment capital allocation strategy in terms of where we\u2019re putting capital to work and the amounts are not really changing, there\u2019s no change in strategy there.","From a leverage standpoint, our leverage is in line with other REITs today. And actually from a rating agency standpoint, the credit markets already treat as if we\u2019re rated higher than we are. You can see that in the results from the bond offering. And so to get to 4.5 to 5 times, is really about optimizing our flexibility over time. So if you look at sort of where the deleveraging should come from, right, with organic EBITDA growth of around 4% and the Project Summit benefits, it will grow to $200 million, those in of themselves will reduce our leverage, right, that will allow us to reduce our leverage.","We continue to see this strong demand in data center and other projects, and look at even what our pipeline is today, we\u2019ve actually taken our data center capital for the fourth quarter up a little bit to get some projects started, particularly in Amsterdam and Virginia, where we see strong demand. And so we expect that our leverage will be flat to slightly down in 2020 as the benefits from Project Summit start to flow through from there. And so going back to sort of longer term financial framework at 4.5 to 5.5, obviously, optimizing between 4.5 and 5.","Eric Luebchow","Great. And then, just a follow-up on the data center, if you look at your pipeline, how should we think about the mix of kind of the more hyperscale business, which I know has slightly thinner returns and your kind of traditional retail enterprise business. And maybe \u2013 if you could maybe provide an update on the kind of Frankfurt JV process and how you\u2019re thinking about that?","William Meaney","Okay. It\u2019s a good question, Eric. I think that the \u2013 if you look at this quarter, for instance, where it\u2019s obviously biased towards the hyperscale win that we had in July. I think that kind of smooths out over time. I think that I would say that we anticipate, we look at size that lend themselves to hyperscale like Northern Virginia, I think, when it\u2019s fully built out, it would be around 50-50 or even 60-40 hyperscale just in terms of a large facility like that, which will still give us blended cash-on-cash returns of the 11% to 12%. So for us, it\u2019s all about speed of fill in terms of the mix between hyperscale and what we call, normal enterprise.","The one thing I would add though is the other aspect about hyperscale, which is not lost on us, is we do have some hyperscale customers that have similar returns as enterprise, when they actually deploy an edge-type deployment, so smaller deployment. So when you say hyperscale is a customer for us, but there\u2019s even segment within a hyperscale, they have some requirements that look more like enterprise, when they call edge, and then they have other ones, which are pure large deployment. So \u2013 but we still net-net we think about half of our business will be hyperscale, and we\u2019ll end up with the kind of 11%, 12% cash-on-cash returns.","In terms of Frankfurt is we continue to have positive discussions about putting that into a joint venture. It\u2019s not absolutely critical that we do that, but we would like to do that, because it just allows us to stretch our balance sheet or expand faster into other areas. And as you can with the pipeline of 15 megawatts already sold or booked year-to-date, we\u2019re doing \u2013 we\u2019re pretty pleased with that, and we don\u2019t want to slow that down.","Eric Luebchow","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Andrew Wittmann","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, the dividend increase here wasn\u2019t the 4% you guys talked about kind of mentioned that you\u2019re going to use these proceeds that you\u2019d otherwise putting the dividend towards deploying into the data centers. Is this the right way to think about the long-term growth rate of the dividend, considering that you\u2019re probably going to continue to have data center investments?","William Meaney","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question, Andy. I think that \u2013 and you\u2019re right to kind of cite, because if you think about what we\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s about 3 or 4 megawatts that to be by growing the dividend at this rate, allows us \u2013 the exchange is about 3 or 4 megawatts. And given the pipeline we have right now is we think, it definitely gives our shareholders better return, if we\u2019re actually taking that cash and given the 11% to 12% cash-on-cash returns and buying 3 or 4 \u2013 building out 3 or 4 megawatts based on the demand pipeline you can see that we\u2019re \u2013 our occupancy is pretty tight on the data center side.","So then if you say on a go-forward basis, we\u2019ll continue to make those kind of trade-offs, it\u2019s probably not lost on anyone, as most of our data center peers are \u2013 have a payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO kind of in the mid-60s to low-70s. So my guess is that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going to settle out just given the demand that we see on data center.","Andrew Wittmann","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I also wanted to ask about the margins in your core North American RIM business. They were noted as down year-over-year, I think, the revenue management techniques were pretty clearly a benefit to the quarter. I was just wondering, how you can reconcile good revenue management likely in North America with the margin performance. What are the things happened there, Stuart, in the quarter that fed into that?","Stuart Brown","No. The main reason is obviously the paper price, right. So if you adjust for paper price margins are actually up year-over-year for the quarter. So that\u2019s really the main driver.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. And then could you just \u2013 because there\u2019s always a lot of moving pieces in your numbers, Stuart, could you just help us understand the change in the midpoint of the guidance, what were the key factors there? I mean, you kind of listed some of them paper, obviously, was one of them as well, but if there\u2019s some other things. Just maybe here, can you just help bridge the new guide to the old guide?","Stuart Brown","Yeah. I mean, the old guide, the midpoint of [$1,460 million] [ph]. We now lowered that to the midpoint of [$1,440 million] [ph], which is actually the lower end of our previous range. The key drivers are, again, even just since the last earnings call, paper prices are down, so down about $15 per ton. So that in and of itself is about $4 million or $5 million of lower paper price, actually the stronger dollar has also impacted us, so that\u2019s right, given where the dollar is right now, again, that can vary a little bit. That\u2019s about $5 million.","The other piece of it is the North America records management. The core services are down, part of it is due to actually lower destructions, which is good for volume. But that\u2019s obviously a headwind or negative for the revenue that comes from the destructions. But we also have lower service gross profit in the UK and France, and a little bit of higher bad debt. Those things have been partly offset with the lower global SG&A due to the cost actions that we\u2019ve taken and lower incentive comps, not where we wanted to be, but I think sort of clear path to where we are in this range.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. So just on that the \u2013 Slide 13 kind of calls out paper separately. So your guidance is actually a little bit lower than the nominal number you just gave there. The biggest chunk that you just reconciled there was paper price for, I think, you said $15 million or so. So all those other factors, how does that go in?","Stuart Brown","Yeah. There are different periods is what you\u2019ve got, right. So one of them is, I\u2019m reconciling guidance in 2019 versus what\u2019s changed from 3 months ago. On Slide 13, if you look at where spot paper price is today compared to the average of 2019 is down about $35 per ton. And then we talked about on the last call that every $10 change in price per ton is about $6 million that get you into the low $20 million impact. Paper prices stayed where they are today compared to the average paper price that we\u2019ve recognized in 2019.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. Cool. Yeah, that period is the key thing on the year-over-year guide, that\u2019s the difference here. Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I\u2019d like to dive a little bit deeper into the pricing and volume growth trends you\u2019re seeing in the storage business. Once you strip up the benefits of your very strong data center growth from storage performance. Can you discuss broadly any changes that you may be seeing with pricing and volume growth?","William Meaney","Yeah. Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Actually, if you strip out data center, we said it was 3% growth total, including data centers, it\u2019s like 2.8%, 2.9%. So the data center is a bigger impact on EBITDA growth, and it does on the revenue growth. As we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s about 7% of our sales as a company, it does contribute about 1\/3, close to \u2013 coming up to 30%, 35% of our consolidated EBITDA growth, but on the sales side it\u2019s actually fairly minimal.","George Tong","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019d like to go back to your strategy around managing a financial leverage, I know, Project Summit is definitely going to help with leverage. But then structurally longer term, what are your strategies around changing or improving the translation of growth CapEx into generating EBITDA, such that your EBITDA growth accelerates and can support increases in gross leverage over time.","Stuart Brown","Yeah. And then \u2013 I appreciate you asking that question, because you get sort of a little bit of multiplying effect, right. You\u2019ll get increasing EBITDA from the results of Project Summit on top of the normal organic EBITDA growth. And so if you look today from a capital allocation standpoint, we\u2019re generating plus or minus $100 million of cash flow after dividend to fund growth, well, that will grow over time, right. So free cash flow after Summit will end, we talked about $200 million or so of EBITDA take a little bit of tax of that. So our free cash flow available for growth investment themselves will allow us to borrow less. So you get higher EBITDA, you won\u2019t \u2013 we won\u2019t be borrowing as much to fund growth. And then you get the benefit of the growth itself.","So as we\u2019re putting capital to work, the EBITDA that comes off of the acquisitions as well as comes off the data center growth will then accelerate the deleveraging. So while, you won\u2019t see as much deleveraging in 2020, because of the cost of Summit, as the flywheel starts going, you\u2019ll continue to see leverage come down. And again, long term, our \u2013 we\u2019ll live within a range of 4.5% to 5.5% \u2013 4.5 to 5 times [EBITDAR] [ph] depending upon where we are in the cycle. 4.5 to 5 times, it\u2019s really optimally where we want to be will provide the most flexibility over time.","George Tong","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Adam Parrington","Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you talk more about the trends in record management volumes this quarter, particularly in the developed markets with volumes declining again sequentially?","William Meaney","Yeah. Actually \u2013 thanks for the question. I think, actually we were pretty pleased, actually moderated the decline in North America. And you have to remember, this is on a very large base. But if you see this quarter, it\u2019s actually an improvement over the most recent trend.","Partly it\u2019s driven by what Stuart said, on the other side it\u2019s a drag on service revenue, because we\u2019ve seen less destructions. So we\u2019re not picking up the revenue there. And then \u2013 so it is slightly negative as you pointed out. And where we\u2019re picking up some volume is on the new storage areas which we picked up about 3 million cubic feet.","But overall, actually the trend is that, it\u2019s moderating. We don\u2019t see a major difference. The thing that\u2019s driving the trends in North America, you could look at North America which is slightly negative and you can look at \u2013 in Western Europe, actually which is slightly positive in terms of volume trends, very similar economic statuses, both very mature markets.","But I think it really comes down to the rate of change of incoming volume and whether or not boxes are aging out or the average age of our inventory is increasing. So we continue to see a fairly steady trend, but not much of an improvement, not much of a degradation and this quarter is actually a slight improvement.","Adam Parrington","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Andrew Steinerman of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Cho","Hi, good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. Just a couple of quick ones on the data center segment, just given the healthy activity, really healthy leasing activity, maybe can you just remind us what the revenue growth goals of the data segment are? And the second part of that is, maybe you could provide some pricing commentary as well in terms of the environment you\u2019re seeing? Thanks.","William Meaney","Okay. Well, so first of all, we maintain consistency. If you look at it right now, as I said, going back to this year, we\u2019re up about 10% since the beginning of the year in terms of leased up activity. And if you correct for the churn, the customer churn that we called out at the last quarter, which we knew when we bought IO, we\u2019re actually up mid-teens year-to-date if you correct for that.","I think that if you look at our bookings this year of 15 out of 20 megawatts target, and so \u2013 I think we\u2019re on track to hit the upper-end of that original range. That again is going to put us in kind of the mid-teens to 20%, so like 15% to 20%, set us up for 15% to 20% growth next year. So we continue to see the growth of our data center business to be mid-teens.","In terms of pricing, I would say that the pricing is fairly consistent. In other words that if we\u2019re looking at enterprise, we\u2019re still getting the cash on cash returns anywhere from 12% to 15% depending on the size of the deployment for an enterprise customer.","And on the hyperscale deployments, we\u2019re continuing to get 8% to 9% cash-on-cash returns, blended 11% to 12% over an entire site or campus. So the pricing is staying pretty stable from what we see and we\u2019re very pleased with those kinds of returns.","Michael Cho","Thanks. And then if I can just squeeze one more on the dividend. I know you \u2013 Bill, you mentioned the dividend comment along with AFFO. So I just want to make sure I got it right. So are you saying that the dividend growth will moderate towards the range of AFFO that you mentioned and you can track AFFO from there?","William Meaney","Yeah, I think most likely. I think the thing that drives it obviously is capital allocation, right? So we do want to continue to grow our dividend at what we think is a reasonable rate to get back to our shareholders. But then, if you kind of look at \u2013 if you look at this year, as I say, the difference between what \u2013 we\u2019re growing the dividend this year versus last year, equates to being able to build out another 3 or 4 megawatts for our data center as an example.","So if you think \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to think of a proxy on that, if you look at data center peers, they are all kind of in the mid-60s to low 70s as a payout as a percentage of AFFO. And my guess is we\u2019re in kind of the high 70s right now. So my guess is we\u2019ll probably settle out somewhere in that range with our data center peers, given the pipeline of opportunities we see.","Michael Cho","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Marlane Pereiro of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Marlane Pereiro","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one, can you discuss MakeSpace in terms of how much accounted for growth in consumer and other cubic feet in storage volumes this year?","William Meaney","Yeah, all right. Thanks. It\u2019s a couple of million. I called out we had about 3 million of what I would call other or of new kind of storage. And it\u2019s about 2.5 million. We expect the full year to be about 2.5 million to 3 million cubic feet coming from MakeSpace. So a small but growing and we\u2019re really pleased with the partnership we have with MakeSpace.","Marlane Pereiro","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. Hey, you folks are pretty clear. But I wonder \u2013 pretty sizeable restructuring, when did you kind of make the decision that it\u2019s kind of had to happen? And then, the design aspect of it, how long did it take to kind of, number one, determine you\u2019re going to do it and then put the structure in place to announce it?","William Meaney","Well, that making the decision to do it was literally this week to how should it be, because you don\u2019t do these things lightly. We want to make sure we had full discussions with our Board before we tackle them. But obviously, we\u2019ve been looking at this for months. So, I mean, that you can imagine that we\u2019ve been looking at this for pretty much the \u2013 since the winter time.","Kevin McVeigh","And then, I guess, from a cost perspective, is it primarily on the storage side, where it\u2019s going to sit or the service? And then, ultimately, is there any way to think about \u2013 the 2020 framework on the EBITDA was helpful \u2013 does it assume there is no revenue slippage or any thoughts on what the cash flow impact, like if you were to think about free cash flow in 2020, Stuart, is there a way to maybe just help us frame that?","I know it\u2019s not formal guidance, but it seems like the EBITDA is pretty \u2013 there is a range there. But just any thoughts on what that cash flow would like, and again, is there any kind of revenue impact from these actions or is it kind of revenue continues on trend?","William Meaney","Kevin, just to be clear on this is what we\u2019re doing \u2013 this is probably atypical that what you hear in a lot of restructure. This is not about the coalface or the people who are actually delivering and picking things up with our customers every day nor about the people at the frontline for the most part. This is really about changing the way we manage and lead the company from the top.","That\u2019s why if you \u2013 coming back to it is 45% of people from Vice President and above are impacted, which is difficult for all of us. But the main benefit of this, so coming to your revenue question, is a year from now \u2013 it\u2019s painful going through these kinds of realignments and organizational change, so you can imagine that people are feeling that, because it\u2019s a close knit company.","But a year from now, we\u2019re going to have a much nimbler and agile leadership structure, which allows us to action quicker on behalf of our customers in giving them integrated solutions, which quite frankly none of our competitors in specific business lines can do, because most of our competitors are either doing storage or scanning. None of them are doing storage, scanning, artificial intelligence have the data center and have a relationship with them that\u2019s \u2013 with the customers that are global.","So this is really about speed. So what we see, we haven\u2019t built any of that into our guidance, but we\u2019re doing this, because we expect to have a positive impact on the revenue side. But we haven\u2019t built that in, because we\u2019re much more saying, we\u2019ll tell you when we see it, we don\u2019t promise something that we don\u2019t see.","So, right now, what we laid out with the program by actually changing the way we lead and operate the company, we\u2019ve outlined the cost impact that naturally flows from them. But this is all about speed and ease, both for our internal mountaineers, make their job easier, as well as our customers to interact with us.","Kevin McVeigh","Understood.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q4 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. Please go ahead.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Kavita. And welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and year end 2014 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and year, as well as progress towards our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and updated guidance for 2015. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","As we have done for the past couple of quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on our Investor Relations page of the website at www.ironmountain.com under investorrelations\/financialinformation.","Referring now to page two of that supplemental package. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","Bill Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I think, given recent new stories following on from our December announcement with respect to a proposal to acquire Recall. I think, I should just make a statement before we get into discussing our results for both the quarter and the year.","We strongly believe that our acquisition of Recall would provide both companies shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in the growth of the combined businesses with attractive growth prospects.","We believe that there is significant value creation potential from such a transaction for both companies customers as well. We continue to try to figure out ways to narrow the valuation gap, but will only pursue a deal at the right price. We have nothing to report at this time.","With that, let me turn to our results. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, wrapping up an eventful year of good progress on our three-year strategic plan and our successful conversion to a REIT.","During 2014, we continue to improve results in our developed markets, expanded our exposure to faster growing emerging markets and generated momentum in our emerging business segment.","In addition, we expanded our REIT investor outreach and we were added to the MSCI REIT in the FTSE\/NAREIT indices, inclusion in these important benchmarks is important for generating a high level -- a higher level of awareness of Iron Mountain as an attractive REIT investment.","Let me now turn to financial highlights, Rod, will have more in a few minutes. On a constant dollar basis, our financial results for 2014 were right in line with our expectations.","The significant strengthening of the dollar in the fourth quarter impacted our reported figures as it did for most multinational, resulting in growth in total revenue and adjusted OIBDA of over 3%, including restructuring charges.","But on a constant dollar basis, we believe more -- which we believe more accurately reflects core operating performance, growth in these measures was just under 5% at the top end of our ranges.","These results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our three-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth on a constant dollar basis in both total revenues and adjusted OIBDA.","Turning to operating highlights, total storage revenue, the key economic driver of our business was up 5.4% in constant dollars for the year, driven by strong growth of 13% in our international business and roughly 3% gain in both our North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments.","These results reflect our continued focus on driving net positive Records Management volume in storage rental revenue growth in developed markets and further penetration into higher growth emerging markets.","In developed markets, we further sharpened our focus with the fourth quarter sale of our shredded operations in the U.K., Ireland and Australia. We chose to divest these businesses because they were much smaller than our North American operations and we did not benefit from the same scale.","At the same time, we acquired Securit Records Management in Canada, which brought us nine facilities in 3 million cubic feet of records, including available space to support the on-boarding of a major new customer.","In Records Management, we added more than 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a base of 500 million cubic feet at the beginning of the year or 3.6% net growth.","The growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround from negative to positive internal volume growth, in other words, before any impact of acquisitions, we achieved in North America. Importantly, North America represented 20% or more than 20% of our gain for the year, excluding volume from acquisitions.","Globally, we maintained customer churn of under 2%. This is unchanged from Q3 levels but represents a 30% improvement over the level of customer losses experienced two years ago.","This combination of improved customer retention, growth in new sale and consistent new volume from existing customers drove 3.5% internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter, continuing the steady improvement we achieved throughout the year.","Our strong fourth quarter growth rate did benefit from favorable comps relative to the 1.3% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, but even when normalizing for that we saw a nice pickup and are pleased with the momentum as we head into 2015. Our internal storage rental revenue growth expectations for this year are in the range of 2% to 2.5%.","Turning to emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth countries represent 13.9% of our total revenues at the end of the year on a constant dollar basis using our 2014 FX budget rates and a 12.8% on reported basis.","You\u2019ll hear from Rod that FX currency rates will be a drag on reported performance this year. Whilst our operating margin in virtually all our countries are naturally hedged and preserved, like most multinationals we\u2019re not immune to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings impact in U.S. dollars.","However, given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we like the fact that we have the benefit of investing in U.S. dollars overseas during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in these markets as they\u2019re beginning to embrace outsourcing of enterprise storage, especially given the durability of our business.","Both internal total revenue and internal storage rental growth in these markets was more than 15% in the fourth quarter. In addition, unlike more mature multinational growth rates are fairly similar around the globe, we are in a unique position to invest in our capital markets where we are still early in the growth cycle enabling us to capture higher growth rates of a lower basis, thereby enhancing our returns in the medium-to-long term.","Given this is a backdrop, acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy with a focus on high-growth emerging markets. We completed $190 million of acquisitions in 2014, including the records inventory of smaller Records Management companies with more than $125 million of the total in emerging markets through Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific regions.","We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in emerging markets with more than four times the coverage needed to achieve our goal of 16% on a constant dollar basis and will continue to evaluate those opportunities in light of our targeted returns in favorable underlying growth dynamics that support the durability of our business. Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to make progress in our data center operations.","We have invested more than $70 million to date with $35 million of that in 2014 expanding our capacity in the underground facility in delivering our first phase in Boston. Whilst absorption in our Boston data center is just beginning to pick up on a blended basis, we have achieved stabilized unlevered return on invested capital in this business of 9%, which we feel -- which we feel is good given how recently we added our new capacity and expected this return will stabilize at 11% to 12% on a fully utilized basis.","We continue to evaluate other emerging business opportunities that leverage our unique platform as a leader in enterprise storage. We see the potential to extend our brand strength in chain of custody and logistics to a broader range of offerings. Many of these opportunities are customer driven where they asked for our assistance in solving an enterprise storage need whether it be upstream in their supply chain or downstream to support distribution. We expect to have more on this at our Investor Day in October.","These facets of our strategic plan, all support the durability of our business, the sustainability of our cash flow and are fit as a REIT. When you consider the nature of our business, our enterprise storage foundation compares very favorably with self-storage. We have superior customer credit quality given our service to more than 92% of the Fortune 1000.","We serve more than 155,000 business customers, which leads to a diversified revenue stream in low customer churn of less than 2% per year. Unlike consumer self-storage where customers tend to be in transition and frequently have more temporary need, the average life of a box in our facilities is 15 years.","This means we have very low volatility. In fact, we posted 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, which persisted even throughout the great financial crisis. And like self-storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers underlying storage needs.","We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector if you think about the nature of our operating facilities. The major difference is that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot. We're essentially renting air. This multiplier effect generates a significant spread between our costs and our return on investment. It yields a very high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders.","Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invested incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shell, we can generate very strong returns due to this volume dynamic.","As we\u2019ve talked on recent calls, we intend to buy $800 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. This supports our REIT status but it also means we have more optionality over the long term. If we consolidate in the market and exit buildings that we own, we can leased them to customers for other industrial or distribution uses or we can create value by selling them or redeveloping the underlying real estate in infill markets for alternative use.","Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and execute our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and\/or equity issuance, similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth.","You may have seen that the board declared our first quarter dividend of $0.475 per share this week at a $40 stock price. Our implied cap rate is about 7.5% well above where other property sectors are trading. At the same share price, our dividend represents a 4.8% yield, well in excess of most REITs, combined with our goal to grow adjusted OIBDA by 4% on a compounded rate. Our dividend level supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in line with the 8% to 9% TSR or total shareholder return of the S&P 500. And this goal is prior to any potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rod.","Rod Day","Thanks Bill. We continue to execute well against our strategic plan. And we're pleased with our strong operating performance for the year. Our results underscore the durability of our storage rental business and demonstrate the benefit of acquisitions we have made in emerging and developed markets.","I\u2019ll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. Please note that throughout my prepared remarks, I will reference selected slides from our comprehensive supplemental reporting package, which can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","Turning to our financial results for the quarter and the year, let me direct you to the financial highlights on page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $778 million, up approximately 1% compared with Q4 of 2013 and up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, total revenues grew by 3% to $3.1 billion, or by 4% on a constant dollar basis and in constant dollars at the top end of our guidance range.","Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $220 million, compared with $195 million in 2013. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4% to $926 million or by 5% to $934 million on a constant dollar basis.","For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for 2014 included $3.5 million of costs associated with the company\u2019s restructuring initiative. In addition, adjusted OIBDA in 2013 included $19 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million in the full year of restructuring costs.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per diluted share, compared with $0.21 in 2013. For full year 2014, adjusted EPS of $1.36 was within our guidance range. As we highlighted on our Q3 earnings call, adjusted EPS for the full year was impacted by REIT compliance costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our conversion to a REIT as well as acceleration of real estate consolidation and some of our acquisitions.","It\u2019s important to note that adjusted EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Our structural rate for the year came out to 14% as a result of lower pre-tax income in international jurisdictions, which was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long term.","The fundamentals of our business remained strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth.","On page 9, topline growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis was up 5%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 4%. The growth in service revenue was driven by increased project activity, improvement in paper revenue, and recent acquisitions. On a constant dollar basis, full year total revenue growth was 4% driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 3%.","Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvements in net volume growth in Records Management, with total year-on-year volume growth of 3.6%, including acquisitions or 1.9%, excluding acquisitions.","Growth, excluding acquisitions, maintained the steady improvements in performance that we have seen in the last two years. Within this, we continue to see strong volume from existing customers, provided approximately 30 million cubic feet of storage worldwide in this category. This number of boxes is consistent with prior years, but the percentage growth dipped to just below 6% in Q4, driven by the denominator effects of our growing base of records under management.","Let\u2019s turn to page 12 where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q4 and full year segment results were generally in line with our expectations, as our strong storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American records and information management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of 38.5% during the fourth quarter and the year.","North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. During the fourth quarter, the strong storage rental growth in DM more than offset the decline in service revenues, resulting in adjusted OIBDA expansion of 130 basis points. Declines in service revenues and Data Management continue to reflect the trends towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues, as our customers rotate their taste less frequently and the business becomes more archival.","The International segment continued to generate attractive results, with 8% storage rental internal growth and 4% internal service revenue growth for the quarter. For the full year, storage rental internal growth was 6% and internal service revenue growth was 2%. The international business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in line with our mid 20s targets for the year. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to continuous improvement in integration expenses and other IT project expenses.","Let me direct you now to page 11, where we lay out our performance for the year against our guidance. We will cover this as a high level noting that constant dollar revenue and adjusted OIBDA were at the high end of our growth expectations. Our full year FFO and AFFO were also in line with our expectations, excluding the impact of FX. Our total distributions for the year, including the E&P purge or special distribution, were about $1.1 billion. Approximately $200 million was return of capital representing less than 20% of the total.","It is common for a REIT to have some portion of its distributions characterized as return of capital, particularly in its initial year. In order to qualify as a REIT, it was critical that we purge our entire legacy E&P, including the E&P from our foreign QRS entities, before the end of 2014. We intentionally built the level of conservatism into our distribution estimates, as we did not want to risk on this distributing and filing to qualify.","Also highlighted on this page, our investment and capital expenditures we have made during the year. Real estate investment of $200 million for the year is in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Our maintenance CapEx was $83 million at the low end of the guidance range. Non-real estate investment of $43 million was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This was driven by timing of certain IT investments, which will now occur in 2015.","Acquisitions for the year were $189 million at the low end of our guidance range. Although the acquisition pipeline is large, we are very selective in the acquisitions that we undertake and we ensure that they are meeting our hurdle rates.","Turning now to our outlook for 2015 on page 10, business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, we have updated our 2015 guidance to reflect FX headwinds and our new constant currency rate, which was based on rates at the beginning of this year.","We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 1% to 5% in line with our strategic plan. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.30. To be clear, this guidance similar to the preliminary guidance we provided at the last earnings call reflects our anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars offset on a per share basis by the impact of shares issued in connection with the special distribution and in addition the impact of FX.","Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $425 million to $465 million, with AFFO between $480 million and $520 million. Please note that for 2015 guidance, we have deducted non-real estate investment from our AFFO calculation in response to constructive feedback.","While not strictly maintenance related capital expense, these expenditures are necessary for us to support our RIET IT and customer interface systems and a somewhat recurring in nature. Therefore, we believe this change to our definition of AFFO is a more conservative approach.","As you saw yesterday, we announced our first quarterly dividend for the year of $0.475 per share. We continue to believe that our cash flow supports our dividends at current levels and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance.","From a capital spend standpoint, we expect investment in real estate be to $230 million to $270 million, including investment in racking. Maintenance CapEx consistent with prior years is expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range. Non-real estate investment is also expected to be in the $70 million to 90 million range, which is higher than recent years due to the inclusion of REIT compliance related CapEx and the timing of certain IT investments.","Acquisition investments are expected to be $150 million to $250 million. It\u2019s difficult to be precise here, as acquisitions are opportunistic in nature. We will update our outlook again on our Q1 earnings call to reflect any changes, if any, including the impact of any further changes up or down in FX.","Shifting to the balance sheet, pages 26 and 27 present all debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $700 million. As forecasted at our Investor Day last year, our lease adjusted leverage ratio would increase to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. In quarter end, it was 5.4 times as planned. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%.","Turning now to REIT specific metrics on page 20, we provide our global real estate portfolio, which highlights our leased and owned facilities worldwide. The number of leased facilities increased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2014, as a result of our international acquisitions through which we assumed a few operating leases. As we begin to consolidate facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by a square footage.","On page 21, we have provided storage net operating income, or NOI, per racked square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI from combined Records Management and Data Management of approximately $29 per racked square foot worldwide, due to the multiplier effects of renting our space by the cubic foot. This level compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector.","On page 22, our racking and building utilization rates are high and have improved slightly since the last quarter at 91% and 83% respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time.","On page 29, we have provided components of value, the summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area.","We think about our valuation as a REIT by applying the self-storage or industrial cap rates to our annualized NOI from our storage rental business. On top of the market value of our storage business, we add the value of the services business by applying appropriate multiple. We also provide other tangible assets, our current investments in buildings and racking, as well as the book value of recent acquisitions.","We also provide liabilities, including our annual rent expense, to which we apply cap rate and deduct as another form of debt. We hope you find this disclosure useful. And as we've said in prior communications, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting and welcome feedback.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Bill.","Bill Meaney","Thanks, Rod. Before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to summarize this morning\u2019s key points. Our 2014 financial results were on track with our expectations prior to the impact of foreign currency and in fact revenue on a constant dollar basis was at the top end of our range. Moreover, we look for similar constant dollar growth in 2015, consistent with the three-year plan we laid out at our Investor Day nearly a year ago.","Our fourth quarter operating results demonstrated the success of our initiatives to drive volume in storage rental growth in both our developed and emerging markets and we\u2019re maintaining momentum as we move into 2015. We have attractive high return investment opportunities in all of our segments, including potential acquisitions in developed and emerging markets, and interesting initiatives to leverage our enterprise storage rent through emerging business opportunities.","We are maintaining our dividend in line with the growth in operating profit, which represents an attractive yield whilst providing cash flow to fund required CapEx and a portion of our growth investment. We\u2019ll continue to maintain our capital allocation discipline. And like most REITs, we'll look forward -- we\u2019ll look to fund external growth with new capital after first demonstrating our ability to generate the appropriate returns. Our business is durable and predictable and is characterized by attractive fundamentals compared with self-storage and industrial property types.","While FX has been a drag in the recent quarter, we also see the current FX environment has an opportunity to take advantage of the strong U.S. dollar to increase our small but growing investment in the high growth emerging markets at favorable rate.","With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","At the internal growth in service up 3% and actually, I did catch also that, it was an easier comp? You mentioned even normalizing for the easier comp, this looks like a recovery? Could you go over some of the components of what drove a positive experience in North American service on an organic basis and looking into 2015, do you think this will be a volatile division or do you think that will be firming up?","Bill Meaney","Andrew, I think, you were slipped at the beginning. But, I think, your -- I don\u2019t think we -- I hope we've got all of your, you are asking about the internal growth. And we called out the fact that we\u2019re guiding for 2% to 2.5% and we had a very strong quarter. You want to understand how volatile that is and what drove the improvement. Is that correct?","Andrew Steinerman","On the service side of North American box","Bill Meaney","On the service side?","Andrew Steinerman","Yeah.","Bill Meaney","Okay. I think on the service side, I will let Rod talk you through because you also asked for the different components and I think I would say as an introductory mark before, Rod takes you through the different components of that? Because there as you know, there are multiple things in our service revenue, some of it is driven by paper prices. Some of it\u2019s driven by the ins and outs associated with our Records Management business. There are different components that are more volatile and more in direct control of the operations.","So, I think we have seen an improvement around our imaging business and paper prices and we have a new dedicated leader that\u2019s just looking at our digital or scanning operations, so we have seen an improvement in that area. But we still see some of the underlying trends, especially in our Data Management area in terms of the some of the service associated with transport but Rod, you may want to talk about it in more detail.","Rod Day","Yeah. I think that\u2019s right, Bill. The way I think about service revenue and I\u2019m sure, I think you do as well is that service revenue that we can directly influence and this is more sort of independent, if you like from some of our core Records Management business and then there is service activity that is dependent on the activity of what\u2019s going on within whole storage side. I think what was positive for us in Q4, we look at the first areas of the stuff that we can influence directly. We had a particularly good quarter in what we call projects. So that\u2019s where we do specific assignments for customers to sort of help them more with Records Management issues and that was a good strong performance.","In addition, we also have the benefit of a good shred performance during Q4, some of which was driven by an improved paper price that we\u2019ve seen take-off bit in Q4. In terms of the activity associated with our records business within the RM side, although there was still a sort of modest decline, the decline is not as serious as we\u2019ve seen. And so again, I think you know we were nervous about calling the bottom of that. But at least, it was a more favorable quarter than we\u2019ve seen and actually follows on from Q3 in that regard.","I think the contrast of that would be, as Bill said, within the DM side, we did see quite a significant drop in service activity associated with tight and sort of tight rotation. Now let\u2019s talk about 2015. As Bill said, we\u2019ve actually done a bit of reorganization on the service side, particularly within North America to give more focus to our scanning business and our shredding business, which I think will benefit us. And I would hope that within the RM side, although that\u2019s probably still be continuing declines with activity associated with box, but that should be it and that would be at lower levels.","But on the DM side, I do think we will continue to see quite significant reduction so. In terms of summary, in terms of the activity that we can control, I think will be -- I\u2019m hoping for a good performance there on the stuff that is more difficult for us to control. RM more positive than it\u2019s been. DM, I think will continue to struggle.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay.","Bill Meaney","The other thing I would add to that, Andrew, is on the DM side, there is a couple of initiatives that we are doing to try to mitigate that. First of all, we do have a new offering in Secure Destruction, which we are seeing, albeit off a small base but very rapid growth on that base. So, I think you'll start seeing that come through in some of the service numbers associated with the DM business.","The other aspect is that we have taken a focus on maintaining and in some cases, trying to add additional volume and what we call our premium transport services around DM, which is dedicated transport. So there are couple puts and takes in initiatives that we've just started in last quarter, last year and we expect those to continue to come through. But the overall trend in DM, as it becomes more archival, like the box business. The DM business is a little bit behind in terms of the lifecycle of that.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh","A real nice job. Hey. Obviously, I don\u2019t know if you can\u2019t comment on Recall at all but they reported, they said there is further discussions, things like that. Just any update in terms of how you are thinking about that, Bill, particularly given the pullback in the Aussie dollar, does that impact, kind of the approach? And are there any milestones that as you think about the potential transaction from a timing perspective or is it just -- any update at all, if you can talk to it?","Bill Meaney","Thanks for that. I guess, Kevin, you probably expect -- I don't have much more to say than what my statement is that, we\u2019ve obviously seen attractiveness of such a transaction, which is the reason why we put a proposal forward in December. And we look at different aspects of the business that is attracted by it. But it's really a question of whether or not we can get to a value that works for both sides. But I think I don't have any more to say than in my opening statement.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. That's helpful. Hey. And just wondering, if I had a rate, it looks like on the initial \u201915 guide, the internal growth was 1% to 2%. Now, we are saying two to two and a half percentage, is that right?","Rod Day","Say that again? I'm sorry.","Kevin McVeigh","I\u2019m sorry. The internal growth overall in the 2015 guide, I thought initially was 1% to 2% and if I have it now, I think you bulk that up to two to two and a half percentage, is that right?","Rod Day","Yeah. I think just to be clear, there is probably a distinction between -- so if there is a distinction means total internal growth in storage, internal growth side. Bill referenced storage internal growth of being sort of 2% to 2.5%, which is kind of the number that we would expect for 2015, which is distinct from total revenue growth.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. Because it seems like you are doing a really nice job there. And then just one other question in terms of -- with the drop in fuel, I know you had fuel surcharges, did that kind of work against you, so I guess it seems like the internal growth is probably even stronger than what you'd suggest if some of those surcharges were starting to runoff or Am I thinking about that incorrectly?","Rod Day","No, you're right actually. It does don't have an impact. It did have a relatively small impact to be honest in the backend of Q4. And it obviously doesn\u2019t impact the EBITDA but it does impact the revenue slightly.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. And then just one last and I apologize. I will get back to queue. It sounded like, Bill, you announced a major new customer. It doesn\u2019t look like the CapEx from a racking perspective picked up. Was that a secured customer. or was that kind of an organic and any sense as to just what\u2019s vertical that\u2019s in?","Bill Meaney","I think you're referring to, is in relation to the Secure acquisition, I\u2019d say it also helped us on-boarding a major new customer, is that what you are referring to, Kevin?","Kevin McVeigh","Yes.","Bill Meaney","Yeah. No, I think that -- well, it did help us a little bit in terms of the amount of CapEx for racking that we needed to deploy for that because we were able -- we bought Secure, they had some spare capacity in some of their other facilities, which we are able to use to onboard this new customer. So, I think that is true and that\u2019s up in Canada.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. Super. Thanks so much, nice job.","Bill Meaney","Thanks.","Rod Day","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittman with Robert W. Baird.","Andy Wittman","Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start by digging into some of the restructuring costs in fourth quarter. You may have said this on the conference call rather but I missed it. What were the restructuring costs this year and last year in 4Q specifically?","Rod Day","Okay.","Andy Wittman","Sorry, just want to get a sense of the comparability of the margins?","Rod Day","No. I got it here. So the restructuring charge for this year in Q4 was zero and for last year was $18.6 million.","Andy Wittman","Okay. So that implies that the margins are somewhat weaker here as we look at the segments, it looks like some of that was driven internationally, it looks like the guidance for next year takes a low end of the EBITDA or the OIBDA growth down a smidge? I guess, Bill, when you think about that, what\u2019s the driver there, is that continue to be the international performance or is it something else? Could you help us understand that little bit better?","Bill Meaney","Well, I think that, if you look at our international performance is still in the range, though we said slightly below the 25% that we reported last year. But it really is dependent in terms of how we grow the emerging market portfolio, because it\u2019s a -- it will ebb and flow as we add new countries into that portfolios. As we said before it\u2019s -- you put something in the funnel and it grows to mimic U.S. margins, which are even much higher than the 25% that a year ago we reported in the international segment. So that will ebb and flow in that range as we actually add new investments as we build market leading positions in the various geographies on the emerging market portfolio.","Rod Day","Maybe, I\u2019ll just make a comment on FX just, because that\u2019s the difference if you\u2019d like between the guidance, say we have approximately 40% of our revenues internationally and we\u2019ve seen a 12% decrease in FX on those revenues across those basket of currencies, so as a kind of impacted around sort of 4%, 4.5%. So you can see that the scale of the issue if you like and that\u2019s what\u2019s -- that\u2019s really the only thing that\u2019s driven the change in guidance.","Andy Wittman","Got it. And then, just how much of the factor is pricing and I know several quarters ago now there were some large customers that you decided that wasn\u2019t worth to loss the customer to keep down the churn, I think, that ultimately was, obviously, I think a smart decision? How much of that continued, Bill, and how much of pricing is maybe a factor in your margin performance?","Bill Meaney","It\u2019s a good question, Andy. The pricing -- the beginning of the year, we probably weren\u2019t as sophisticated as being into on pricing. In the middle of the year we hired a new person in-charge of pricing and we on boarded in November our new Chief Marketing Officer with that comes under. So we have seen during the course of the year being able to up our game in the pricing area.","So this year, obviously, we turned around the performance in North America from a volume perspective. So that helps as well and we put those two together, which especially towards the second half of the year in terms of adding more sophistication and more horsepower in our pricing area, you put those two together and that\u2019s why we feel pretty confident that, when we talked about internal storage revenue growth for next year in the 2% to 2.5% range.","And if you recall, in quarter one last year we started off at 1.3%. So it\u2019s been a nice trend and we've been building some momentum through the year, both on the volume side and now on the latter half of the year on the pricing side.","Andy Wittman","That\u2019s really helpful. If I -- could you allow me one more question, I guess, this one to, Rod, on the capital structure. Debt-to-EBITDA now at 5.4 times, just wanted to get your sense of your comfort level there? I guess, last time we checked that was at the high-end or slightly above your targeted range? Is there been the change in the way you look at the range or is this really kind of staying there recognizing that you maybe able to get a lot more EBITDA, if you can come to terms with Recall, without having a lot of incremental debt, therefore taking you better into your targeted range that way? I just trying to understand, how you are thinking about that, if there's a need for fresh equity through a public offering, or if you feel like you are going to re-equitize the balance sheet through a deal and if that's, what\u2019s preventing you from maybe reducing the leverage that way?","Rod Day","Actually, I don\u2019t really want to talk about on sort of Recall and how that would may or may not impact things. Let me just talk about in isolations. I think the first point to say is that the leverage ratio of 5.4% is exactly what we predicted at our I Day presentations. So there\u2019s actually no surprise in that. And we\u2019ve landed in a preciosity of the point where we thought we would. But our stance is over the long-term -- a range of 4% to 5%, we think is optimal from a sort of cost of debt or cost of equity and trade off.","But in terms of -- and raising any further record as Bill referenced in his remarks, we would do that on the basis of having compelling investments to make in a bid in acquisitions or in real estate in particular. Very, very common for a REIT, that\u2019s the situation that we are in and that\u2019s how we would look to fund things going forward.","Andy Wittman","Okay.","Rod Day","No, do you want to add on that, Bill?","Bill Meaney","I think that\u2019s spot on.","Andy Wittman","That\u2019s fine. Thanks guys for the answers.","Bill Meaney","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","If you look at Record Management volume growth this quarter ex-acquisition, it was relatively consistent on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But if you look at the fourth quarter organic storage revenue growth, it accelerated from 2.2% to 3.5%, given the volume growth was consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis, is the different essentially coming from stronger pricing trend?","Rod Day","Yes. That\u2019s good. There was actually a slight improvement in terms of our volume growth quarter-on-quarter. But you are right and George, it doesn\u2019t explain the full difference by any means. Two things that are going on. One, we benefit from relatively weak compared to last year because as you may recall on our earnings call this time last year, we were talking about a number, sort of pricing adjustments down with what we have to make during that period.","So in a sense, the sort of the year-on-year comparison and it slightly falls. But even if you strip that out, we have seen an improvement, a disproportionate improvement relative to our volume. And that comes back to -- in terms of the overall mix price and that\u2019s what Bill was referencing earlier in terms of our ability, if you like to get more pricing traction than we\u2019ve been able to do and maybe earlier in the year.","Bill Meaney","Yeah. No, I think that\u2019s right. So as you called out, we started off Q1 at a storage rental internal revenue growth of 1.4%. We ended up the year at 3.5%. As you say, even if you correct other things that Rod\u2019s talking about, you were in the upper half of the 2s in terms of internal revenue storage growth rates. So, we've seen a really nice trend in pick up during that area.","I think we also guided at the beginning of the year that we were -- we did call out that we were underperforming and we are very comfortable that we could get to the 2% to 2.5% range and we think we\u2019ll be able to continue that momentum this year. And just to pick you up on one other thing is that, we have seen a nice progression in terms of the volume growth, the storage volume growth over the last say two years where we've gone from Q1 in 2013 in terms of internal storage volume growth before acquisitions of 1.1% net growth and we progressed up to this last quarter of 1.9% growth.","So, we've seen a very nice expansion and that's really been driven by both better offense and defense in terms of retaining customers and also gaining new customers, so we feel like things are starting to come together. So, we feel pretty confident that we'll be able maintain that momentum into 2015.","George Tong","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And last quarter your C dollar OIBDA growth was indicated to be 2% to 5%, while this quarter the range was widened to 1% to 5%. Can you talk about how your views on margins have evolved over the past quarter?","Rod Day","Really, no material shift other than the issue of FX, as I was referencing earlier so and that's really the only change that we have to our thinking.","George Tong","Okay. And then last question for me. Real estate acquisitions, I think in the past you've indicated, they will be largely funded by ATM offering, which is typical of RIETs. Can you discuss returns you\u2019ve seen from recent real estate acquisitions you\u2019ve done and what the plan is for 2015?","Bill Meaney","Yes. So in terms of the returns that we would expect from acquisitions, I would distinguish between acquisitions that we make in developed markets and acquisitions that we make in emerging markets. And given the sort of the risk profile within emerging markets, we look for higher returns than we would expect than in developed markets.","The range that we look for is 9% to 11%, so that the -- I'm always worried about quoting averages here because each day when we look at on a case-by-case basis and risks adjusts and make sure that we\u2019re getting good quality returns on a case-by-case basis. The average is 9% to 11% typically higher in emerging and it is easier to take lower returns in developed where it\u2019s more predictable.","George Tong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Good morning. Could you -- it looks to me that the service revenues -- just following up on Andrew\u2019s question, it is better than it\u2019s been in a very long time. Can you give us just the organic services revenue in North America in aggregate, was it positive?","Rod Day","The North American service revenue for the quarter, Andrew, or just for the year?","Shlomo Rosenbaum","For the quarter. For the quarter.","Bill Meaney","Sorry. Yeah, definitely. On a constant currency rate, we are at 2.4% in the Records Management, which is a good performance. But we have seen a decline of 4.2% in Data Management but certainly in the North American space that was a strong -- sorry, the RIM space that was strong performances compared to where we\u2019ve been.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","If I put them together, North American general services is positive now?","Bill Meaney","Yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Very good. And then what\u2019s going on in the U.S. government market. You guys added some capacity, I saw in news like a month ago. Is the government right to go after that really huge market that you guys have been talking about for years?","Bill Meaney","Yeah. Shlomo, I think it is a good question. And you probably also noticed, I think we had a press release just a couple of weeks ago that we had a new head of federal who has a wide of depth and experience in that that area. We have as you know that we invest when we can see the revenue coming. And I think we feel like we\u2019re getting pretty close on a number of discussions with the federal government and we still see that has a very big unvented opportunity for us.","So yes we are and it\u2019s probably little bit overstated to say we\u2019re bullish but we feel that we're building momentum in that vertical. And we\u2019re really pleased by how fast our new leader of the federal business seems to be getting his feet under the desk.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Great. And then middle-market, any update over there in terms of kind of a strategy post the acquisition you made a little while ago?","Bill Meaney","I think that the -- on a Cornerstone acquisition, which I think you\u2019re referring to, we talked about that we\u2019re getting some of the D&A to go after that market. We do think that that's a real opportunity for us because as I think I\u2019ve said before is our market share or representation in that market is almost a quarter of what it is in the large enterprise market. And that is the market that tends to have better internal growth rates among themselves and good pricing. So that is an area where we have taken some of the D&A from Cornerstone and we have some of our folks working on how to better go after that.","And also the reorganization that we did a year ago is already starting to show some benefit in terms of better penetrating that market and that was breaking -- getting the feel people aligned with the local territories much tighter. So I would say we\u2019re still in the early part of the game on that, but we're starting to see -- we definitely see the opportunity and we\u2019re starting to slowly see some results in that area.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And this is for Rod. Just going and looking at a kind of change in the AFFO calculation. Is this $70 million that you moved out of AFFO because some focus somewhat more recurring, is that non-real estate investment correct line on slide 10?","Rod Day","That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s exactly right. And just to get a little bit history on that, we were talking to a number of REIT investors and there was kind of confusion around what\u2019s maintenance for a company like us. So we\u2019ve always had the real estate maintenance expense within our AFFO and following feedback, we thought it was appropriate to include this additional spend which is generally sort of recurring in nature. And therefore it gets sort of more conservative and more prudent view of what the AFFO number should be.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So is there a difference between the $70 million that came down in the $70 million to $90 million range?","Rod Day","So I don\u2019t \u2026.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","In other words, if I take AFFO in the old definition to the new definition, it\u2019s down $70 million but the range of $70 million to $90 million. Is there an improvement somewhere else?","Rod Day","No. No that\u2019s the only adjustment.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Would you mind just walking us through kind of sources and uses for next year? From starting with an AFFO that should be roughly $500 million and I take kind of the midpoint of real estate investment, maintenance CapEx, business and customer acquisitions. I netted out on the $500 million and I would go to issue about negative $30 million, use about $400 million of dividends. Is there -- there is clearly you have about $600 million of liquidity, if you pulled that all with debt you kind of bump out of our debt. How should we think of it from a modeling perspective?","Rod Day","I think while I draw that, try my best for the case that would be long sort of detailed analysis. If we could do that offline, very happy to do that but it will take quite some time to work that through with you.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll take your appointment. Thank you very much.","Bill Meaney","Bye.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Dan Dolev for Jefferies.","Dan Dolev","My question, I won\u2019t take step back and kind of look at the last few years and ask you if I look at the last three years you spend about all-in $1.5 billion in CapEx. And if I look at the EBITDA progression, so called since 2011, it\u2019s down about 2.5%. So what kind of return were you aiming to get on the CapEx and why isn\u2019t EBITDA growing if you did get return on that CapEx? Thanks.","Rod Day","I think that what you disentangle is Sort of what\u2019s been going on with the some of the underlying performance of the business, certainly in the sort of \u201811 and \u201812 period and the returns that we\u2019re getting from the CapEx that we spend. So during the sort of the \u201811 and \u201812 period, the two things were happening. And one is we had a sort of poor performance on our services side of the business but it impacts our business negatively.","And the second is depending on which EBITDA you\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re investing in REIT costs which obviously has the benefit further down the P&L in terms of tax. And if you then just strip out the CapEx, the investments that we\u2019ve made. The typical returns we look to get on those certainly in excess of our WAC which is 8% and obviously that will vary depending on the secured investment that we are making. But then if you sort of layer them back on top, that will then contribute in a positive way to EBITDA.","Dan Dolev","Okay. Understood.","Bill Meaney","Okay.","Dan Dolev","And one last follow up, on the dividend, you sounded a little bit more reserve, if I understood correctly on \u201915 dividend? Are you still committed to $4.10 to $4.20?","Rod Day","I think, we are -- so the reason why we gave the -- this is a dollar guidance in the previous quarter, was really because there was so much going on with the dividend, with special projects and an E&P projects and special payments. And we are happy that we were getting questions coming in from investors because it was quite a confusing pitch. So we thought that would be helpful number to put out.","Now we are through all that. We will just go, I don\u2019t know sort of quarterly basis in terms of our per dividends payment. So, I think Bill, referenced in his remarks. Our policy like is to grow that dividends in line with our operating performance and that\u2019s what we were doing.","Bill Meaney","Yeah. That the only I was just saying, I think, we are -- I think it\u2019s also clear, where we are guiding now is on a per share basis and I think I kind of fumbled over cents whatever, but its $47.5 of per share is what we are guiding over and that, as Rod said, grows in line with operating income, because we are now through the project. I think, with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to the operator.","Operator","And at this time, I will turn it back over to Bill Meaney for closing remarks.","Bill Meaney","Yeah. I think I have already done the remarks, Operator. So I just want to thank you all for joining us this morning for our call and we look forward to speaking to you in three months.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12710":["Iron Mountain Inc.

I will now like to hand the call over to, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Melissa Marsden. Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Keyva and good morning, everyone. This morning we\u2019ll begin our call with remarks from Bill Meaney, our President and CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and progress towards our strategic initiatives followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial and operating results.","After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations\/Financial Information.","Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and supplemental package do contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s supplemental the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to those measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","Bill Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to be reporting solid second quarter results that we\u2019re in line with our expectations on a constant currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds, we\u2019re comfortable maintaining our guidance our for 2015 as we typically see a bit of a ramp in the second half of the year.","It was a very eventful quarter with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Recall Holdings and the initiation of our transformation plan, which will drive significant improvement in our overhead cost structure and support strong cash flow generation in years to come, even prior to the substantial and additional synergies we anticipate from our acquisition of Recall.","I\u2019ll get to the last two items shortly, but first I would like briefly cover certain financial and operating highlights. Our momentum in the storage rental business continues to build and drive durable results in line with our strategic plan. On a constant dollar basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 2.2% reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.1% and service revenue declines of just 0.6%, foreign currency impact year-over-year in total revenue by roughly 6%, reflecting the strong appreciation of the dollar experiences at this time in 2014.","We also continued to see good internal growth with storage rental, up 2.7% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year-to-date reflecting continued strong growth from data management or DM and the other international segment and stable performance in Western Europe and North America rim. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 in the mid 2% range. The realignment of our data management business we initiated last year is yielding good result. DM storage continue to show very strong internal growth with 5.3% increase over last year. Total service revenue internal growth was flat for the quarter and down just 0.5 point year-to-date in line with our expectations for continued yet moderating top line headwinds.","Looking at volume in records management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12 months basis, representing 2.8% net growth. This growth was maintained in part as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or in other words before benefit from acquisitions.","Net volume growth in North America was 1.2% or 0.4% on an internal basis excluding acquisitions in line with Q1 levels. Globally we maintain customer retention of 98% in line with the first quarter and a 20% improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just two years ago.","Now turning to our transformation overhead optimization program we announced in June prior to the Recall acquisition news. We\u2019ve spoken with many of you about this over the past several weeks and highlighted our reorganization in April in which we put a single leader over our developed market has facilitated this important program.","This initiative calls for taking $100 million out of overhead costs or SG&A between now and 2018 in this independent of and additive to the Recall acquisition. This will bring us from our current overhead of more than 28% of total revenue down to the mid 20% range, and more in keeping with best practices for companies with similar size in global reach.","Importantly, we have already implemented a portion of this program and achieved $50 million of cost reduction or half of these savings with a charge to be taken in Q3 and the full benefit of the $50 million to be realized in 2016. With a partial year contribution from this program we expect the net impact for 2015 to be neutral.","Also in recent communications we\u2019ve illustrated how the decline in our service margins over the past few years and more recently FX headwinds have offset the attractive returns we achieved from investment in real estate in acquisitions. In fact, during this period we have been achieving unlevered returns on invested growth capital in the low teens and have seen significant contribution flow through in the past couple of years.","We initiated some programs last year and are continuing to implement changes that we believe will allow us to stabilize the service margin trend line and get back to around 27% by the end of the year.","It is important to keep this in perspective. While service represents 40% of our total revenue, today it represents just 17% of our total gross profit. Again to be clear, we are talking about a slowdown in the activity of physical records and tapes being retrieved, not a slowdown in incoming volume of records and tapes to be stored.","Whilst demand for typical office cut sheet paper has declined between 2% and 4% in the mature markets, in the past few years, we continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded from our existing customer year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business.","We do continue to expect service revenue headwinds of negative 1% to negative 2% annually over the next few years and in fact we did see flat service revenue this quarter compared to a year ago period.","And whiles we can\u2019t completely offset the impact of lower service revenues due to a decline in retrieval and re-file in transportation activity, we can do more to align our service cost structure with this decrease in activity levels. So what are we doing to address this service margin decline? First we are looking at ways to variabilized more of our cost.","Second, we are exploring efforts to make more efficient use of third party logistic suppliers or 3PL where we can be assured they will maintain our quality and focus on secured chain of custody. We have used this in Europe on a smaller scale and believe we can expand the use of 3PL elsewhere.","And third, we are using technology more proactively such as using sensors to detect when shred bins are ready \u2013 are ready to be emptied to make roots more efficient.","Additionally, in this quarter we have seen an uptick in our bad debt. This has come out of our North American business and is primarily the result of refining our billing process over the past 18 months to 24 months. During this transition we didn\u2019t adequately refine the process before moving responsibility for the North American billing offshore. Here is now our robust plan in place addressing this.","Now let\u2019s turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of industrial logic and strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. I assume by now you are familiar with the basic terms of the deal, so I won\u2019t review all the information but rather just touch upon the highlights. In the announcement presentation, we illustrate estimated total net synergies of $155 million with $110 million of that to be achieved by 2017.","These synergies are driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead, and when fully realized, will lead to double-digit accretion in adjusted EPS, FFO per share, and AFFO. At 25% of our size, Recall is managing a similar global platform in terms of country coverage as they are in 24 countries, compared to our 36 which drives much of the overhead synergies.","Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. With the additional cash available to us from our transformation plan as well as recall synergies, we can not only fund a stable and growing dividend per share, but we also generate the capital we need for growth.","Additionally, we have complementary market platforms with Recall having a more developed presence in the small-to-medium businesses whilst we have significant presence with the larger enterprise customers.","We\u2019ve been on the road over the past several weeks and have met with a number of our shareholders, as well as recalled major holders in Australia. And what we\u2019re hearing is universal agreement that our two companies are worth more together than they are separately. You can see that several Recall shareholders have increased their holdings and appreciate the attractiveness of owing the combined company. Even our most seasoned devices have noted that they cannot remember a deal that delivered 26% EPS accretion in three years time. In the next several weeks we expect to file the shareholder meeting document, seeking approval of the acquisition, which will have additional detail, including proforma results.","Turning back Iron Mountain, on past calls we discussed progress on our three-year strategic plan which rests on three pillars, getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster-growing emerging markets and continued to explore adjacent opportunities in our emerging business segment. Whilst the Recall acquisition and transformation plan have guarded a bit more internal and external attention of late, we continued to make good progress on our base plan, achieving consistent positive storage volume growth in developed markets in completing an organizational realignment to put developed markets under common leadership, which enables our ability to implement our latest transformation program as well as to accelerate our service margin initiatives.","Additionally, in emerging markets, we continued to progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by the end of next year. We pressed the pause button on acquisition for a moment to assess some of the transactions in the pipeline, might be affected by the Recall acquisition, but we are resuming activity and continue to be pleased with the quality, size and scope of our pipeline.","We\u2019ve also discussed on recent calls how we have been impacted by the effects of currency, translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. While FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our gross and adjusted OIBDA margins is muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge.","On the other hand, we continue to believe that the current strong dollars \u2013 positive in terms of investments opportunity. Given our intend to expand what is today, a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle.","This may take the form of M&A, or in the purchase or development of real estate. In both cases, we can benefit from investing at a low basis.","In addition, we have deepened our focus in the real estate investment area, adding an experienced REIT asset manager to accelerate our plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next eight years to ten years. As we seek to shift our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties, on average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going-in cap rates and our market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership.","We think this is important and appropriate as a REIT, as it supports such being viewed more in line with traditional REITs by the rating agencies and investors. Importantly, our debt to total market cap and our debt to EBITDA measures, are in line with major REIT sector leaders [ph] and our internal storage rental revenue fared better than these sectors during the recent recession. When we did not have a down year. Our low volatility business is distinguished by a track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue. As we think about the opportunities to grow our storage rental business it is important not to lose sight of the durability of the business which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone.","This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. As we noticed in recent calls, the restructure is consistent with our capital allocation goals; it does not limit our ability to fund our business plan as we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline. We expect to fund that incremental investment with excess cash flow or additional borrowing.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Rod.","Rod Day","Thanks Bill. Our results continued to demonstrate that durability of our storage rental revenue stream and the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. Our performance is tracking in line with our full-year expectations.","To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, including overview of results by segments. Then I will address plans and expectations related to our transformation program and our next step to improve service gross margins. I will briefly touch on the recall acquisition calls and also our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since June on the constant dollar basis. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens.","Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring now to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, total reported revenue was $760 million, compared with $787 million in Q2 of 2014 down, by 3.5% year-over-year. This reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5.7% or $44 million. Excluding FX and so on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.2%.","Year-to-date reported revenues were $1.51 billion, compared with $1.56 billion in 2014. Again on a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was also 2.2%. Worldwide revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter and 4.63% year-to-date. This was offset by service revenue declines of roughly 1% for the quarter and year-to-date.","As we did for the prior quarter, we are providing bridging schedules for revenue, OIBDA and earnings which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These were on Pages 20 to 22 supplemental.","Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $223 million compared with $242 million in 2014, down 7.7% on a reported basis and 3.3% on a constant dollar basis. The constant dollar adjusted OIBDA decline was driven by investments in new product introductions for example in data management.","In addition, we had a $4 million increase in bad debt expense. As Bill mentioned, during the offshoring of our billing activities, our collection efforts fell behind. However, we now have a strong remediation in place. Service margin declines were further drive on the business although these were offset by improvements in storage contribution. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per diluted share, compared with $0.41 in the second quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution, which we made in the fourth quarter of 2014.","In addition to the earlier OIBDA write-down, adjusted EPS was also impacted by an increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt. As stated in our earlier calls, this year-over-year increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion related expenses, such as E&P purge and the depreciation amortization recapture payments.","On the subject to debt, please note that it\u2019s our instance to refinance our high coupon debt when conditions allow. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 13.9% compared with 15% in the prior quarter, primarily as result of mix change in income from foreign jurisdictions.","We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long-term. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share $0.48 for the quarter, $0.98 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $130 million for the quarter and $255 million year-to-date.","Let me now turn to Records Management volume trends on Pages 10 and 11. As you can see, we achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 3% in Western Europe and 9.7% in the other international segment, delivering global records management net volume growth of 2.8%. We continued to experience strong organic growth with second quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.8% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers. We continued to add approximately 30 million gross cubic foot of storage in the last 12 months, consistent with prior periods.","Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American records management and information, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was flat for the second quarter. Year-to-date North American RIM internal storage rental revenue grew by 0.2%. Internal service revenue growth showed a small improvement in Q2 with a decline of 1.3%, compared with decline of 1.8% in Q1. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 39.4% for the quarter and 40.2% year-to-date.","North American Data Management delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.3% in both the second quarter and year-to-date. However, service declined by 1.7% for the quarter and 3.8% year-to-date. As we continue to see declines in re-file and transportation activity. During the second quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 50.8% from 52.7% in Q1, as we continued to invest in new products.","The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 3.5% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by declines in internal service revenue, 4.8% for the quarter and 3.7% year-to-date. The decline in service revenue was driven mostly by the sale of our shred business in the UK and Ireland was at the end of last year.","Adjusted OIBDA margins declined in Western Europe this quarter due to legal cost related to a customer dispute. The other international segments, which is made up of emerging markets in Australia built strong growth in both storage and service revenues.","Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.3% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 13.5% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date. This quarter emerging market revenues represented approximately 14% of our total revenues on a constant dollar basis.","We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high-teens to low 20s range. We continue to expand our exposure in these fast growing markets.","As Bill mentioned, we are leveraging our new leadership structure to focus on integrating across \u2013 cost developed markets. Rail transformation program which was announced last month we expect to achieve approximately $100 million production in overhead expense by 2018. Actions we have taken this month are expected to yield a full year $50 million benefits in 2016.","We will see partial benefits this year at the end of the year. However, these will be offset by severance related charges. We are anticipating approximately $10 million of severance related expenses in the third quarter as a result of this program.","Let\u2019s now discuss our initiative to maintain and enhance service gross margins. As Bill outlined, decline in service gross margin [indiscernible] as a drag on our performance in the last four years. [Indiscernible] the strong returns that we\u2019re seeing from investments in real estate and M&A. That said, it should also be remember that on a constant dollar basis, we have seen good improvements in overall contribution year-on-year in 2014 and we expect the same in 2015.","As discussed earlier and as you can see in the supplemental on Page 26, in the second quarter, service gross margins have declined year-over-year. The actions we are now taking are not yet reflected in our results. In the second half of the year, we expect to see an improvement in service margins that continues to targets a year end run rate of about 27%.","Let\u2019s touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As Bill mentioned, we\u2019re making good progress with regulatory filings. To prepare for closing we incurred approximately $6 million professional and advisory fees this quarter. We expect about $10 million to $15 million of additional spend in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year.","In addition to these advisory fees we\u2019re expecting approximately $20 million to $25 million charge in the second half of the year to prepare for integration, including Recall\u2019s reconversion. Please note that these costs will be excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation, as they are one-time in nature. These costs are also included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.","As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in June, when we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Recall. Please note that at this time our guidance doesn\u2019t reflect the benefit or impact of potential Recall transaction. We\u2019ll provide detailed guidance for 2016 and beyond at our upcoming Investor Day in October. For 2015 although we expect revenue to be as anticipated on a constant dollar basis for the full year, given FX movements, we expect reported dollar revenues to be towards the lower end of our range. As regard to other metrics for both constant and reported dollars, we expect them to be well within our ranges.","Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels within 2015. And we intend to maintain our dividend per share rates for the reminder of the year, subject to Board approval.","Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains, $470 million, giving us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund our core real estate investments or bow cracking, which support approximately 2% organic growth in our adjusted OIBDA.","2016 and beyond, assuming the Recall acquisition closes and with the transformation benefits, we have excess cash that can support potential growth in the dividend and fund discretionary investments in real estate, M&A, or emerging business opportunities. These investments achieved returns of [indiscernible] and are accreted to shareholders. To sum up, we have adequate dividend coverage, excess capacity and attractive investment options.","Shifting to the balance sheet, at the quarter end we have liquidity of approximately $750 million. At quarter end, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7 times as expected.","Turning now to REIT specific metrics. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI approximately $28 per racked square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 84% respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90%s. When we enter a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time.","Investment page, Page 32, the supplemental, highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth related investments and exclude consolidation related expense. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns in our growth racking and building development projects.","Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of various metrics of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether facilities are leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area.","Overall, we believe this is a solid quarter and we\u2019re pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the business. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, improving service margins, achieving overhead cost reductions through our Transformation Program and realizing the synergy benefits of the Recall acquisition.","Now that concludes my summary for the Q2 financials.","Bill Meaney","Okay, thank you Rod. Before we turn to Q&A, just to wrap up, I just want to emphasize a few things. That first of all, we have a number of exciting developments underway. We have already executed on half of our plan for significant cost reduction of more than a $100 million and we will see the full benefits of the first $50 million for 2016. We have actions underway, that we expect will stabilize the margins in our service business.","We are keying up to close the Recall deal early next year and are organized internally to support a smooth integration of Recall. And our attractive emerging business pipeline is delivering interesting adjacencies that can further extend the durability of our enterprise storage business.","Finally and most importantly, the strength of our business, plus the transformation program support approximately 11% to 14% growth in the cash we have available already next year to grow our dividend per share over time and fund our growth investment. This is even prior to the Recall acquisition.","With that operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. Bill, very helpful comment, or there any type of goal post you can give us in terms of cadence on Recall, I know there\u2019s a process involved in any [indiscernible] so on and so forth. But is there anything, you could point to that we kind codage [ph] give us cadence as the deal progresses over the course of the year?","Bill Meaney","Hi, good morning, Kevin thanks. Well, I think the same goal post that we set on the beginning is that we started the regulatory review process, rent engaging the regulatory review process and that\u2019s a six to 12 months process. We feel that we should be able to do it at the lower end of that range. So our expectation is still the first quarter for 2016 and the net \u2013 we will continue to update that changes, but I think right now that\u2019s our expectation.","I think the other goal post as we said on this call within the next few weeks both us and Recall will be issuing documents for their respective shareholders for the \u2013 get ready for the shareholder votes. But those are probably just two goal posts that are important to highlight.","Kevin McVeigh","And then just the $20 million to $25 million of Recall we conversion costs is that something about right, does that mean it\u2019s a dual track in terms of you start that reconversion process now. So when the deal occurs, it was goes lot of day one?","Bill Meaney","Yeah, well, I think, that the \u2013 it\u2019s a very good point. Yes, we will start incurring cost and Rod can give you more detail on that. We\u2019ll start incurring cost as we speak now in preparing for the REIT conversion, because we need to convert before the close of the first quarter. So you\u2019ll also note us in the documentation is, that we have set it up the documentation that we will close at the beginning of a quarter. So the idea is that we will close either at the beginning of the first quarter, or either \u2013 the first month of the first quarter, i.e. around the month of January or it would be beginning of the month of the second quarter, again to give us time to actually execute the conversion. But the prep for that conversion obviously starts way in advance of closing the transaction, I don\u2019t know Rod, if you want to add any?","Rod Day","Yeah, I think, that\u2019s a good summary, Bill. Kevin I can\u2019t exactly tell you when but it is by the end of the first quarter and obviously given the limited amount of time that we have, it\u2019s important we get our preparation right in advance of that. So it\u2019s really worth spend is primarily related to.","Bill Meaney","And you\u2019ll see that in the documentation on the deal is that it\u2019s very clearly set out that if we miss roughly the first say four or five weeks of a quarter then it\u2019s been a delay for the next quarter because again we have to get the conversions done during that period.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And then \u2013 and this will be my last question, I apologize. Would there be any incremental tax expense like [indiscernible] step up from the racking on the initial conversion or that $20 million to $25 million had primarily professional fees things like that?","Bill Meaney","Yeah, that relates primarily to professional fees.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andy Wittman of Baird.","Andy Wittman","Hi, good morning guys. Bill I had kind of a strategic question. We\u2019ve seen some consolidation in the shredding industry. You guys have kind of aided that as you got all of your European shredding. I was wondering as you look at your business today, particularly as a REIT, does even more disposition of the shredding assets make sense for you, particularly if you could find a partner that would be able to do this with. Let me something, you\u2019d be open to considering or our considering today.","Bill Meaney","Well, I think first of all just from a general capital allocation standpoint we look at all our businesses and say, we the best owner for that or is that where we should invest capital. So we look across all our businesses. So to say that we are open to certain segments and non-open to others would be probably a false premise. But I mean we like you look with interest in terms of what seems to be happening in the shredding business. We feel good in terms of what we\u2019ve done over the last six, 12 months in terms of first of all divesting those shredding operations the one in Australia, the one in the UK, where we didn\u2019t think we have to scale, we get the kind of returns that we expect in demand.","Well, separating the U.S. operation to be more of a standalone unit so that it has the right focus and cadence associated with it to achieve the results that we think are possible.","So I think we feel comfortable where we are, but we were also very pleased in terms of the way the market seems to be valuing these assets, whether we own them or we sell them.","Andy Wittman","Yeah, okay, good, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess I wanted to gain a little bit more in the transformation business. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what some of those, maybe some confidence that they are not going to affect but the customer experience and your retention rates are rather business drivers.","Bill Meaney","It\u2019s \u2013 excellent question. So I think first of all, we need to start the top that we are starting from a base, where our SG&A is 28% of sales, which is clearly on the upper end of what our company with our scale and scope should be able to achieve. It should \u2013 company of our scale and scope should be in the, let\u2019s say the mid-20s, I mean, probably the lower side of the mid-20s, in other words, not \u2013 it\u2019s probably kind of more of the 23% to 25% ranges where a company of our size and complexity should be.","So that\u2019s the first thing to give you kind of a sense of what\u2019s possible. Then the thing that triggers it is, this \u2013 really if you think about it, there are I would say three buckets. One is just getting efficiency through the reorganizations that when we put all the developed markets under 1% then it allows you to rationalize. You know you have two finance groups, you have two HR groups, you have two commercial leadership groups, you have two engineering groups et cetera. So you\u2019re able to actually shrink that to one to get some of the efficiencies and economics of scale that you would expect.","I think the second aspect of it is looking at what we call just general spans and layers, probably it\u2019s triggered by that move by just saying, what is the right breadth of responsibility in the organization. Do we have too many layers? And I think that\u2019s just good housekeeping that all companies our size need to go through every so often to make sure that we don\u2019t have what I would call organizational tree or layers building into the organization and to me that\u2019s important not just from a cost standpoint but it also important from a dynamic standpoint, I mean, by dynamic is to be quicker, nimble, more nimble, less bureaucratic. So I think that\u2019s a \u2013 its shows up in the cost line but we also expect that to show up in the revenue line.","And then the third aspect is it\u2019s related a little bit to the aging of some of our aging of our receivable split which lead to a bad debt charge, is that we need to look at our processes first and foremost in terms how can we make those more efficient and then where should those be done, should they be done internally, should they be done internally offshore or should they be done by an outside party. And that\u2019s the third bucket that we are going through both optimized those processes. And then figure out where they should be done either within Iron Mountain or by an outside vendor. And that\u2019s kind of that the three buckets that we\u2019re going through. Now at last when you can imagine we are actually using also some outside help that have done this a number times.","So we feel very confident in terms of the targets and we feel very confident that we are doing this in area that doesn\u2019t impact the customer experience and service levels and in fact, I think, our expectation is it should improve, as we look to make the organization quicker, more nimble and less bureaucratic.","Rod Day","Yeah I mean, I\u2019ll just add to that, Bill, I think if you benchmark are announced and against comparable type companies, I think, you can say we are behind where we should be on some of the stock. And that gives us confidence around the program that we have. So things like offshoring, we\u2019ve done some of that, but nowhere near enough we have done some process improvement but nowhere near enough. There has been some improvement in our SG&A and as a percent of revenue over the last couple of years. But again if you look at benchmarks, if it is median benchmarks, represents 25%, Bill you know you compare that to where we are obviously. And again I think that gives us additional confidence to what we\u2019re trying to do is now rocket science it\u2019s just what we should be doing.","Andy Wittman","Yes, okay. I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi, good morning.","Bill Meaney","Good morning, George.","George Tong","You\u2019ve talked a bit about various puts and takes in OIBDA margin performance in the quarter and some of it appear to be transient in nature. Can you frame up how you think about OIBDA margin on a go forward basis? And any plan in reinvestments of the benefits you expect from the transformation program?","Bill Meaney","So I\u2019ll let \u2013 George, I\u2019ll let Rod kind of go through a little bit more detail, but the bridging to get at a high level and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we provide these bridging schedules is so that you can \u2013 we\u2019re highlighting the things that we \u2013 that in our view are one off either because of that something specifically had in the quarter or when we\u2019re talking about the service, where we think we\u2019re going to end up at the end of the year, in terms of service margins based on some of the improvements that we\u2019re making. So the intent of those bridging schedule is to guide you to where we think we\u2019re moving to \u2013 where we should being on a normalized basis on an OIBDA margin basis. But Rod, may want to comment in more detail on that.","Rod Day","Yes, maybe to answer the question in two parts. First, instances would be underlying not sure if you like \u2013 at the P&L, basically what we expect to see continuous improvement in performance as the year progresses. And that is to be expected as you know, that\u2019s key volume continues to build at the decent price closer to decent margin. So quarter after quarter after quarter, we should continue to build. Around that, obviously then you have to some of these one offs in the quarter and we pulled out a couple of them one with this bad debt expense issue and Bill referencing some of the deals related to the offshoring of our drilling activities. We also had a \u2013 an investment in the data management space around new product introduction, which obviously the expectation of that is there will be returns coming from that in future. So there were a couple of some key one-offs for the quarter. But to underlying that that sort of [indiscernible] fundamentals of the P&L, this was a relentless drive upwards on the storage side.","George Tong","Got it. And can you talk about how your storage pricing strategy compares with Recall, and how do you think about pricing as a contributor to storage revenue growth going forward?","Rod Day","Well, I think, first of all I can\u2019t comment in terms of compared to refocus. We haven\u2019t exchanged or shared any commercial information. We have to go through the regulatory aspects. So I can\u2019t comment on how we compare to Recall. But I think if you look at the results that we\u2019re getting, as you can see \u2013 I mean, I think, the way you look at it is couple of ways, is we\u2019re getting, I would say fairly regular yet modest price increase that offsets the inflation that \u2013 the low inflation levels. But I think as I said, I think, a number of times on calls, there\u2019s been low inflation environment, price increases are more challenging. I think the other thing to look at if you look with the \u2013 if you look at what\u2019s been happening to our gross margins associated with storage you can see they actually, there\u2019s a slight uptick.","So that gives you a view that in a low inflation environment obviously we have wage inflation that is still real in terms of what we pay our folks. But we\u2019re able to get both, productivity increases and pricing increases, that allows us to either maintain or slightly enhance our gross margin. So we feel pretty good in terms of what we\u2019re getting, in terms of pricing and something that we continue to work on, I think I told you we brought somebody in about a year-ago, just to our new leader for the pricing group that seems to be getting some good traction. But I also think it\u2019s important to understand that in the low inflation environment, these are small numbers that you are dealing with, you are not dealing with large order of magnitude. But the results are good. I mean our gross margins are stable and I would say it is slightly higher than they were a year-ago.","George Tong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi Bill, I just want to know if the data management, new products were as planned, should we expect a similar level of investment to $1.5 million, in the quarter in the second half of the year. And if you could just give us a little description or these new products in the area of capable all thing or is it something a little different with then data archiving?","Bill Meaney","Hi, Andrew, good morning. There is couple of aspects, first of all what we have in the bridge was a very specific one-off associated with our relaunch of a product that\u2019s associated with secured destructions. So that was a very specific one-off re-launch of that particular product.","I think that there even if you add that back, you will notice that our margins are slightly down from where they were a year ago, albeit they are very good margins. But they are slightly down. And we didn\u2019t bridge to that for the reason that your highlighting right now is, we are \u2013 we have made a conscious decision to incur some additional OpEx which is associated with launching new products in that area.","So one of the areas, I think, we\u2019ve publicized is that we have a partnership with EMC that offers both their customers and our customers a joint, it\u2019s kind of a combination of our datacenter, our Cap business and EMCs data to main business which a datacenter replication hardware offering they have. And that there is an investment associated with standing up those new products. Our expectation, the reason why we didn\u2019t bridge that is you could say that that was a one-off for this quarter, but our expectation is we will continue to make those kind of investments has we see a pipeline of further products like this one that we\u2019ve announced publicly with EMC. So I think that\u2019s the way I would think about. So what we have in the bridge was very specific to a product launch that we did this quarter that we really anticipate as a one off, but we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur some OpEx investments in terms of the new product launches.","Andrew Steinerman","And was that always envisioned in the plan like \u2013 so that spending now doesn\u2019t affect the guide for the year.","Bill Meaney","Yes, \u2013 no that was always in the plan and that was part of separating data management under a separate leader as you know that we brought in Eileen Sweeney just a year ago specifically, so that was part of the plan.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. And then if you let me one more. The bad debt write-off the 3.8, obviously that\u2019s a surprise. Are you hoping some of the cost initiatives that you\u2019re talking about could offset that? Or does that in some way kind of tilt the EBITDA guidance towards the lower end?","Bill Meaney","No, I think that what we\u2019ve said in the press release as you\u2019ve noticed that we think that on a reported dollar basis that we are still within the range of our guidance. On a revenue basis, we think we\u2019re in the lower end of the range, but on a reported dollar basis, but it\u2019s in the range that we\u2019ve guided to. So we still feel comfortable about maintaining our guidance that our OIBDA will be in the range as we said out at the beginning of the year. I think the specific \u2013 think about the specific highlight that we\u2019ve talked about on bad debt and I will ask Rod to comment further. But its more about an ageing issue in terms of when we moved the process, we didn\u2019t optimize the process fully before we moved to offshore and we move that offshore as we slipped behind on the dating. So we feel \u2013 we feel good over the next six months to 12 months that we are \u2013 we will be able to get that back in shape and we are well underway, but you can imagine that when you slip behind on the dating it takes a while to fix that back up, but I don t know Rod, if you want to add?","Rod Day","That\u2019s right, Bill in terms of the general component of our bad debt provision its driven by the aging of our receivables and as we move this offshore, the aging deteriorate and a little bit and therefore that triggers an increase in the bad debts and bad debt expense by half a point.","And we are \u2013 I think we \u2013 just to make sure as clear as I, we will get back to our normal range of about a half a point of revenue in terms of bad debt expense\u2026","Andrew Steinerman","Right.","Bill Meaney","Absolutely right, and though \u2013 I don\u2019t know we have various rigorous plans to ensure that that is the case. And just to be absolutely clear in terms of the contribution guidance, we\u2019re in no way signaling the lower end of the ranges very well, so within the range on that.","Andrew Steinerman","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Jefferies.","Dan Dolev","It\u2019s actually Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll ask few questions. We thought a few weeks ago, Bill you did the conference call, you mentioned service margins stabilizing. I see a 330 basis points decline. What gives you confidence that that you could actually stabilize margins in the coming quarters?","Bill Meaney","Hey, good morning Dan. [Indiscernible] it\u2019s a good question. So if we look \u2013 obviously this quarter was below our target of getting 27% by the end of the year. But if you actually \u2013 when we looked at the performance as part of the improvement program we looked at. If we took the month of May, May was a specifically weak month for us on this quarter in terms of our service margin and profitability. If we took the month of May out, we would have 26.1% service margin in this quarter, which is still a 100 basis points, but we know how to bridge that gap. And even when we looked at May some of the things that we\u2019re introducing, we get the sprit [ph] to manage them. So with the month of May, was particularly soft really two things, was one, is verbalizing some of our cost quick enough associated with a normal downtick in revenue, because there is some seasonality in revenue and plus it was a short month. But in terms of the way the holiday is felt.","So those two things that \u2013 which is part of our program, if you remember our three-pronged approach to this is verbalizing our cost base more which the month of May is a great example in terms of what that program is designed to offset. The second thing is using outside parties, and the third one is technology. So, again, the data for the quarter looks worse than it is if you know what I mean in terms \u2013 especially if we add back some of the programs that we\u2019ve introduced to minimize that going forward. So we still are sticking by our guidance that we think by the end of the year will be at 27%.","Dan Dolev","hank you and two more quick questions. On the bad debt expense, I know you\u2019ve addressed it fully, so the uptick from 50 basis points to 70 basis points, is that \u2013 was that a result of ageing or did I misunderstand it?","Bill Meaney","Yes, it\u2019s primarily the result of ageing, is the issue that we\u2019ve referred to earlier.","Dan Dolev","Got it. And without result in any impairment to the capitalized acquisition cost on the balance sheet or\u2026","Bill Meaney","No, no, not, no.","Dan Dolev","Nothing, okay. And then last question, when I was looking at \u2013 EPS obviously was a little slight outdated versus consensus. If you look at both FFO and EPS, it does imply a very significant acceleration in the second half of the year, can you maybe talk a little bit about how your components have actually getting it.","Bill Meaney","Well, I think first of all on the AFFO basis you see, we\u2019re actually been ahead of where the consensus status coming out. So first of all from a cash standpoint we\u2019re actually ahead. I think the bridging schedules I think do a pretty good job in terms of what the puts and the takes were in terms of why we ended up a bit below on consensus. But if you just look at our normal ramp in the second half of the year, part of this is just in terms that we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance we give a year guidance and part of this just a way that the [indiscernible] besides the carve out our annual guidance.","So if you just look at historical ramps in the second half, you don\u2019t find this is as surprise. That\u2019s why I feel very comfortable in terms of maintaining our guidance.","Rod Day","I mean may be just talk specific about EPS, year-to-date we\u2019re at on an adjusted basis $0.60 a share, the midpoint of our guidance for the full year is $122.5 million [ph]. And so you could see we\u2019re almost at the halfway point. As I was saying earlier, because of the dynamics of our business, the storage revenue and contribution growing and quarter-after-quarter, I think you can sort of see how we can reach that point.","Dan Dolev","Right, I was also referring to FFO, it\u2019s a midpoint is about a \u2013 it prices about 14% acceleration?","Bill Meaney","And I think what\u2019s deciding is the same logic, if you like in terms of the flow through, the P&L. So we expect contributions to continue to build, that actually has a disproportion of banks, in sense of the flow through to the FFO. So again we feel comfortable around that number.","Dan Dolev","Great, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Shlomo here. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Yes, Bill, could you go into little bit more detail what you mean about variabilizing the cost with third-party logistics vendors, and we talked about working with like UPS or FedEx or something?","Rod Day","Yeah, good morning, Shlomo. Well, there is two parts, it is variabilizing and is using third-party so that there \u2013 and you could say that there kind of two \u2013 there is two ways of doing it. We also look at variabilizing more of our cost under own our control and we do use temporary workers that are trained and certified and cleared by Iron Mountain, it\u2019s getting that mix right. So first of all we do have a variabilized workforce internally and making sure that we are using more of that which is the thing that helps to offset some of these variabilization of some of the service revenue that goes through and then service revenue for us don\u2019t forget it is more than just transport they rather bid that are contract based so that\u2019s one aspect.","And then on the 3PL side, yes it is like the \u2013 it\u2019s the FedEx and UPSs of this world and other courier services. We use some of them today, we use them more extensively in some European countries, where we \u2013 where the necessity has come even faster because of the size of some of our operations in some of the smaller countries. And we\u2019re using that same doll as a know-how to accelerate that in North America. So it is anytime those logos and others.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thanks for your clarification. Then maybe this is for Rod, the non-real estate investments in the maintenance CapEx, at least for the first half of the year is trending well below the annual targets. Is this expected to get a tick up in the second half of the year or for some reason, where just current levels are more of a good run rate. How should we think of that?","Rod Day","I think there will be a tick up in the second half of the year, but closer to the guidance numbers that we issued in June. It\u2019s just to do with the phasing at certain aspects of all activity.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Is that a \u2013 is there seasonal component to that or it just happens to be year-by-year, and works in different parts of your base and what your plans are?","Bill Meaney","It\u2019s actually largely based on our own plans. It\u2019s an element of seasonality around some of the maintenance activity that we prefer to sort of backload as opposed to doing in the middle of winter of January, February. But it\u2019s largely down to our own planning.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, and then am I understanding you correctly that while you are guiding to the low end of the guidance range because of currency for revenue, you are not winning [ph] to that for \u2013 what for \u2013 am I misunderstanding that?","Bill Meaney","Yeah, that\u2019s correct, that\u2019s correct. So we are taking action on cost to ensure that we still stay towards the midpoint of our guidance right from a constant and a real dollar perspective on contribution and cash.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And is that because of this program or largely because of this program that you just announced [indiscernible] third quarter charge?","Bill Meaney","No, actually that\u2019s not that specifically in fact that the transformation program for us is neutral because we incur severance charge during Q3, which will be offset by run rate savings in Q4. This is more due to other activity that we\u2019re taking.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Bill Meaney","Okay, well thank you very much everyone for joining us this morning and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in this supplemental financial information.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Greer, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, I first wish to welcome Greer to Iron Mountain in her role leading Investor Relations. Finding someone who has the skills, experience, and reputation to replace Melissa wasn't easy. We therefore felt very fortunate when we found that person in Greer. So, welcome, Greer. We're very pleased you are here.","To Melissa, who'll be retiring at the end of the year, I wish to take a moment to thank you as this will be your last earnings call. And Melissa, as you know, started at Iron Mountain the same time as me. And it is impossible today to thank her appropriately. But I do wish to mention that we will be eternally grateful for all she has done doing a superb job leading not only our IR function, but much of our communications as well over the last six years. She has done all this against a backdrop of the company executing an agenda, delivering significant growth to our business, which has been transformative. Thank you, Melissa. I don't know how we would have done this without you.","Now, moving on to the quarter. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial performance coupled with marked progress and our strategic plan as articulated four years ago designed to support the shift in our business mix. Our plan revolves around three pillars: getting more out of our developed markets in terms of yielding cash flow, expanding our Records Management model in the faster-growing emerging markets, and building on our strong customer relationships with 950 of the Fortune 1000 coupled with our know-how in order to expand into adjacent business areas.","To this end, we are very pleased by our progress across these three pillars. A few proof points of this can be readily illustrated at a high level. We continue to maximize yield from Records Management in developed markets with adjusted EBITDA margin in North America RIM now over 46% with growing internal revenue, albeit on lower volumes. We achieved internal service revenue growth of 7%, which is a result of growth in Shred in business areas such as Information Governance and Digital Solutions or IGDS. We progressed towards our goal in making Records Management in the faster growing emerging markets, a bigger part of our mix where these markets represent 18% of our revenue whilst continuing to improve EBITDAR margins which are now over 30%.","And we advanced the expansion of our data center business, which even at this early stage is now making a marked impact on our EBITDA and AFFO growth given it is now more than 8% of our adjusted EBITDA and is already expected to contribute 100 to 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA growth on a consolidated basis.","All told, the consistent delivery against our strategic goals has continued to drive strong growth in profitability as measured by year-over-year expansion in both gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin supporting healthy cash flow generation to fund our business investments whilst also reducing leverage over time.","As a result, this morning, we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend per share in line with our 2020 plan. This is supported by our year-to-date AFFO growth of 13.7%, which is well in excess of our 8% increase in share count. For the full year, our AFFO payout ratio is expected to be sub-80% versus our original guidance midpoint of 81% even after increasing the dividend.","Our third quarter performance outlined on page 3 of the presentation is highlighted by total revenue growth of 12% on a constant dollar basis, solid growth in adjusted EBITDA with an 80 basis point increase in EBITDA margins, continued durability of our storage business with total internal revenue growth of 2.3%, strong internal service revenue growth of 7.1% for the quarter, good progress on integrating our data center acquisitions illustrated by strong data center portfolio utilization of 91.1% and continued organic expansion of our global data center platform, through internal development including breaking ground on our second phase of capacity in Phoenix and entering into a development agreement in Chicago, a top 5 U.S. market.","In addition, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth across all markets supported by internal storage revenue growth and strong internal service revenue growth. We also continue to focus on optimizing both utilization and storage rates to maximize yield as evidenced by further increases in net operating income per square foot as shown on slide 4.","Volume across our Records Management business was down 0.1% on a global basis prior to acquisitions or about 700,000 cubic feet. This was driven by negative internal volume growth in North America and a slowdown in, albeit, continued positive volume growth in Europe. The May implementation of GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation is having some impact on behavior related to destructions.","Whilst a European regulation focused on protection of personal identifiable information, this regulation has global reach and covers record held by European nationals inside and outside of Europe. Beyond regulatory changes leading to increases in destruction activity from time to time, we have also seen a slowdown of incoming volume. As the incoming rate of new boxes decelerates, the boxes held in inventory naturally age during this period.","As the deceleration continues, we expect the ratio of destructions to remain elevated until the rate of incoming global volume normalizes. This interim increase in the rate of destructions is expected to flatten out over time. However, we expect this net volume dynamic to continue for the next few years, and are running our business based on this expectation.","Importantly, this impact is de minimis on a bottom line financial basis and does not affect our financial plan in terms of growth and profitability in cash flow as we continue to expect to offset any volume decline through revenue management, as well as growth in new services. Stuart will walk you through some of the financial aspects of all this in a few minutes.","In addition, I mentioned earlier that our Information Governance and Digital Solutions business is growing nicely and should, over time, offset some of the volume declines in physical storage as our customers increasingly manage a hybrid physical and digital world in terms of how they conduct their Records Management operations. IGDS provides our customers with the ability to convert physical documents into digital content through the use of migration services supporting customers' digital transformation.","Growth has been supported by a robust pipeline of increasingly larger opportunities, as well as greater customer traction. Moreover, in terms of further growing our digitization efforts, our newly announced partnership with Google shows early signs in its potential to increase our IGDS pipeline.","With our recently announced InSight Platform, we have already developed proofs-of-concept, working with customers in oil and gas, financial services, and an internal legal application. Additionally, within our services business, we are \u2013 Secure Shredding unit experienced another strong quarter, driven by a significant increase in paper prices coupled with a 13% increase in tonnage year-over-year. Moreover, we continue to see new opportunities in largely unvended channels such as the federal government.","Specifically on federal government, we were awarded a $65 million five-year blanket purchase agreement with the Department of Homeland Security or DHS. With this agreement, we have the opportunity to deliver significant efficiency gains for DHS providing not only storage and retrieval services, but also accelerating the digital transformation initiatives towards a more modern information governance program.","Additionally, we had another award to help the U.S. Army Heritage and Educational Center with their digital transformation and the preservation of historical artifacts. This is an example of what we expect to be an acceleration in U.S. government outsourcing and demonstrates that our efforts over the last few years are delivering results.","Another government win came from our Fine Art business where we were subcontracted to relocate the collection of the National Air and Space Museum to temporary storage as a result of extensive renovation that will take six years to complete.","Turning now to emerging markets for our Records Management business, we continue to deliver solid internal revenue growth as well as attractive acquisition opportunities to expand our presence in faster growing markets. For example, we recently acquired businesses in China and South Korea which together added more than 3 million cubic feet of storage increasing our scale and further strengthening our position in these countries.","Our data center business continues to perform well with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and investment forecast on plan for full year. Development opportunities to provide capacity to support customer demand in high absorption markets at attractive returns remain robust. To that point, as I mentioned earlier, in Q3, we began construction of our second phase of capacity in Phoenix, which is expected to be completed in June 2019. This phase of capacity will be a hyperscale-ready data center for which we have entered into renewable energy commitments that offset 100% of the power. The facility, including future phases, will add more than 530,000 square feet and 48 megawatts of capacity at full build-out.","In addition, we are entering the Chicago data center market through a development agreement with the Pritzker Realty Group to develop a 13-acre parcel in this attractive market, which has been tight on capacity for some time. We are currently finalizing design plans and at this time, have not invested any material development capital. The site is expected to permit construction of a 36-megawatt colocation facility to support the digital transformation initiatives of global enterprises, as well as meet the security and performance expectations of the largest public cloud providers.","Turning to our Fine Arts business, we continue to focus on expanding our presence in this faster-growing storage-related business, leveraging our core storage expertise and customer service capabilities whilst being accretive to our focus on maximizing yield across our range of storage offerings. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we completed two transactions in the Fine Arts storage business, further strengthening the market position of Crozier Fine Arts business. The first, L.A. packing, crating and transport, strengthens our position in the Los Angeles market. The second transaction, we will assume operations of Christie's Park Royal Warehouse in London, representing Crozier's first Fine Arts storage and service location outside North America.","As shown on slide 5, we remain firmly on track to achieve continued internal revenue growth on a global basis fueled by further yield management with ongoing expansion and development in our data center platform and continued growth in our adjacent businesses. Moreover, given the expansion of our higher growth portfolio, which consists of emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses, we are approaching approximately 19% of our internal revenue or 23% including the acquisitions in the last 12 months with a goal to be 30% by the end of 2020.","Additionally, we continue to deliver improvement across the organization in terms of optimizing utilization and driving margin improvement over time. Altogether, we are within reach to achieve a business mix delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in excess of 5% before acquisitions by the end of 2020.","On slide 6, I want to reiterate that we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets, which assume a 4% annual increase in dividends per share between now and 2020. We have increased the midpoint of our constant dollar AFFO growth guidance from 9% to 14.5% for the full year 2018.","Stuart will discuss the strength of our balance sheet shortly. Overall, we expect revenue growth in 2018 to be between 9% and 11% versus our original guidance of 7% to 9%. We continue to be unique within the S&P 500 in that we are a top yielding company with durable cash flow delivering low- to mid-single digit internal revenue growth, expanding margins, a solid balance sheet, and great long-term growth potential supported by acceleration and contribution from our faster growing portfolio.","These factors are driving consistent growth in both the top line and in cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share at an attractive rate whilst funding investments and delevering over time. This dividend growth model has been further underscored by our announced 4% dividend increase and solid balance sheet.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us this morning. In the third quarter, we delivered strong cash flow growth with solid progress towards our strategic objectives. Our leading Records Management business performed well with steady internal revenue growth and strong margin expansion. Our faster-growing emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses are gaining scale and expanding margins, and our disciplined capital allocation supports strong cash flows to fund our multi-year plan.","We continue to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders through maintaining healthy performance in our durable records and information management businesses, while investing in data centers and other adjacent businesses for further long-term value creation. This is all underpinned by a substantial high quality portfolio of owned industrial and data center properties.","I'll start off with the performance highlights, which you can see on slide 7 and 8 of the presentation. We are trending at or above all of our key financial metrics from our original 2018 constant currency outlook and have increased our guidance for both revenue and AFFO. For the quarter, revenue exceeded our expectations approaching $1.1 billion, growing about 10% on a reported basis, but more than 12% on a constant dollar basis, driven by contributions from our data center acquisitions and strong service revenue growth.","Total internal revenue grew about 4.1% compared to the prior year, and we grew internal storage revenue by 2.3% for the quarter or about $14 million and 2.6% year-to-date. We are pleased with the results from revenue management, but these are partially offset by slower volume growth, which I will discuss in more detail later. Internal service revenue grew by 7.1% in the third quarter and by 5.2% year-to-date primarily due to increased contributions from our Shred business, which Bill discussed, as well as additional digitalization and special projects.","Our adjusted EBITDA grew almost 15% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter to $364 million, with margins expanding 80 basis points year-over-year to 34.3%. The margin improvement resulted primarily from the flow-through of revenue management, the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and labor productivity including ongoing synergies from the Recall acquisition. I'll provide more color on performance by segment in just a moment.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding Recall and related costs, increased about 30 basis points year-over-year due mainly to investing in new growth initiatives and other technology. The adjusted EBITDA margin improvement came even while making these investments.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, down slightly compared to last year, due mainly to the increased depreciation and amortization associated with acquisitions, as well as an 8% increase in shares outstanding following our December offering to fund the acquisition of IO Data Centers. This is all in line with our guidance at the time of the announcement.","AFFO was $680 million year-to-date, up about $80 million or nearly 14% over the prior year, reflecting the strong operating performance, expansion of our data center business and a very disciplined approach to capital allocation while increasing investments in new businesses. We increased the midpoint of our full-year AFFO guidance by $40 million, of which $30 million was from business performance and $10 million was from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. Year-over-year, AFFO growth is expected to exceed 13%.","I'll touch on operating performance in a little more detail. On slide 9, you can see developed markets internal storage revenue growth came in at 0.7% for the quarter despite the negative volume growth, reflecting the impact of revenue management. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 7.1% for the quarter due mainly to growth in our Shred business, project revenue and digitization as mentioned earlier.","In Other International, we continue to see steady internal storage revenue growth of 5.1% \u2013 5.9% for the quarter on 3.6% growth in internal volume for the trailing 12 months with internal service revenue growth of 6.6%.","In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the data center business delivered strong internal revenue growth of 27% for the quarter, though off a small base pre-acquisitions.","Turning to slide 10, you can see the detail of our 80-basis-point adjusted margin \u2013 EBITDA margin expansion with growth in most of the segments. We did experience a margin decline in North America Data Management or tape business, driven by lower volumes as well as customer mix. In the tape-storage business, the amount of digital data being stored continues to grow; however, greater density on data protection tapes is resulting in lower physical volumes.","In Western Europe, margins in the quarter were lower than last year as we experienced higher bad debt in France where we are now integrating Recall's business. Note, though, the Western Europe margins are up 190 basis points year-to-date, reflecting our focus on continuous improvement.","In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins have improved over 44% year-to-date, reflecting increased scale of the business and progress on integration activity. We expect data center margins over time to move closer to a mid to high 50% range as we fully integrate recent acquisitions and add more scale to this business.","Year-to-date, we have executed 6.3 megawatts of new and expansion leases primarily with enterprise customers and the federal government while churn in the quarter was less than 1%. We remain on-track to achieve 2018 revenue of more than $220 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million, which includes integration cost of $7 million to $10 million. We continue also to expect leasing of around 10 megawatts for the year of new and expansion space.","Turning to slide 11, you can see that lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.6 times at the end of the third quarter, very much in line with our original outlook while having debt funded the acquisition of EvoSwitch data centers in Amsterdam. Our current leverage ratio was comfortably in line with other REITs especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors.","As of September 30th, our borrowings were 72% fixed rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.8% and our well-laddered maturity is an average of 6.3 years with no significant maturities until 2023. Our strong balance sheet and capital structure is supported by our significant real estate portfolio and long-term nature of our customer relationships.","Turning to our revised outlook for 2018, we now expect total revenue growth of 9% to 11% with total internal revenue growth between 3.5% and 3.75%, up from 2% to 3% initially. Our outlook for internal storage rental revenue growth is revised downward to 2.5% to 2.75% with total volumes expected to be slightly down for the year 2018 prior to acquisitions.","We've also increased our outlook for AFFO growth, while narrowing our adjusted EBITDA guidance. The details of which can be found on page 6 of the supplemental. We would also like to remind you about the exchange rate impact on our reported results that we communicated on the Q2 earnings call. Exchange rate headwinds have strengthened since then and we've added reported dollar ranges reflective of the headwind to our guidance page in the supplemental.","In addition, we have refined our cash available for dividends and discretionary investments schedule on slide 12 to reflect our expectation of lower cash taxes and interest expense, as well as a lower level of acquisitions in Records Management and slightly higher proceeds from real estate dispositions generating more internal cash to fund investments. While we plan to provide comprehensive 2019 guidance on our February earnings call, at this time, we're basing our business plan on an expectation that internal volume will continue to be negative in North America and total internal revenue growth to be in the low-single digits.","As in this quarter, we continue to expect revenue management to more than offset any global volume decline and to continue growing our internal storage rental revenue in 2019. While we continue to see good progress in our IGDS business, we do recognize that paper prices in our Shred business are at all-time highs which we do not expect to repeat in 2019. We remain confident in our ability to grow adjusted EBITDA, cash flows and, ultimately, our dividend in line with our 2020 plan.","To further underscore our confidence, I would like to provide some perspective around the volume moderation. For illustrative purposes, what for example might be the impact, if we had a global volume net decline as large as 1% of total volume or 7 million cubic feet, which is 10 times larger than anything we've experienced. If you assume the volume decrease comes from a combination of fewer incoming boxes and increased destructions, the revenue lost from the fewer incoming boxes would be largely offset by an increase in destruction-related fees even before any paper revenue.","So, in the first year, the EBITDA impact would be de minimis. In second year, the lost revenue would be about $20 million or $3 per cubic foot. So, even if the global level of decline was 10 times greater than what we're currently seeing, we could absorb the impact with faster growth in our other businesses, better revenue management or cost saving initiatives and continue to achieve our 2020 plan.","In summary, we remain on track to continue strengthening our balance sheet while funding our targeted dividend increases such as that announced this morning. We expect our strong cash flow generation to enable us to fund dividend increases while improving our AFFO payout ratio. We are pleased with our third quarter business performance and results year-to-date.","Our revenue management is working well, driving steady growth and strong margin expansion in Records Management business. Further, we remain intently focused on integrating and scaling our data center platform. We look forward updating you on our progress and providing more detail to 2019 guidance on the Q4 earnings call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we'd open it up for Q&A.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Stuart. To summarize, we've had a strong quarter both in terms of financial results, as well as progress on our strategic plan. Key financial highlights include upping our AFFO and revenue guidance for the year, increased dividend by 4% whilst improving dividend coverage. In terms of key strategic highlights, continued margin improvement, build-out of our faster-growing adjacent and emerging business areas. They now represent almost 19% of sales mix or 23% post-acquisition. This mix is already delivering 4% organic EBITDA growth, some 200 basis points better than three years ago and in line with our 5% organic EBITDA growth goal for 2020. So, we are well on track for our 2020 objectives, given our successful shift in business mix.","Now, operator, we would like to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You've indicated that you're largely done with implementing your revenue management initiatives in the U.S. Can you discuss your progress on rolling out your initiatives in Europe and Asia and frame how continued rollout will alter your internal growth rates going forward in storage?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Okay. No, it's a good question, George. So, I think \u2013 let me answer it in two parts. So, first is that when we say we've completed roll \u2013 we've rolled out the infrastructure but we continue to expect similar levels in absolute terms of revenue management benefit in developed markets next year as we did this year. So, continuing to get that kind of benefit that we've seen in this past year from revenue management for North America in Europe.","In terms of how we're rolling that out, you can even start seeing that in this quarter in terms of \u2013 historically, you'll recall that if you've looked at our internal revenue growth in the emerging markets, you would see that that was almost all driven by volume, and you can now start seeing that we're actually getting positive traction if you \u2013 I know one's on a sequential basis and one's on a year-over \u2013 or trailing 12 months basis. But if you look \u2013 the numbers aren't \"directly comparable\", but you can start seeing that they're starting to actually get a positive spread.","So, we've rolled out \u2013 doing this top of my head, we have a center now, I think, it's in S\u00e3o Paulo. We have one I think in Hong Kong. We have one in Budapest, and there's one in Sydney or Melbourne, I should say. So, we've got four new pricing clusters if you will or where we've actually invested in pricing expertise. And you're now starting to see that spread where we're getting even more in the emerging markets and we expect that to accelerate. So, if you say, if we go forward into 2019 just to underscore this, we expect to get a similar level of absolute dollar benefit or uplift from Western Europe and North America as we did in 2018.","And we expect to get further increases next year. So, we'll do even better on revenue management, but it will be coming from the emerging markets.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up shifting to look at your services business, you talk a little bit about shred paper price trends for next year. Can you talk about on a underlying basis, how service activity is currently evolving, how conversations with customers are changing there and how retrieval and new business activity will alter or not alter the growth trends in services?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So, yeah. So let me answer it at a \u2013 in a first cut and then Stuart may want to talk a little bit more about paper prices because paper prices are a big driver in terms of the results that you've seen in service, because we're benefiting from quite strong paper prices right now. So, if you think about it kind of in roughly three buckets of service as we have the Shred, we would have what I would call the normal transportation and activity service level around RIM.","And then we have new business service areas around IGDS. So on the Shred, there's two aspects and I'll ask Stuart to comment again about the paper pricing. But if you see that our volumes are up by 13%. So in other words, we are actually \u2013 so there is an activity aspect about Shred which we expect to continue through in 2019.","The other part is the benefit that we get on service revenue from selling the paper. If we look at the transportation, our transportation activity continues to slow down, but I think as we've said before on previous calls, if we look at the box business, that's starting to hit a more steady state level. On the tape business, we still see a drop in terms of transportation as the tape business is becoming more archival as well.","But where the real improvement has been in service, so the story of all of a sudden going to positive service is not so much a change in the transportation; it's more about these new digital services or Information Governance and Digital Services that we're operating. And over the last two or three years, we've seen a doubling in that size of that business.","So it's really \u2013 we're quite encouraged that as our customers are trying to manage this hybrid digital physical world, the relationships that we have developed with them on information management over the decades where it was historically more in the physical realm is really giving us the opportunities to help them manage that transition. And we think partnerships such as the Google partnership will continue to add products in that pipeline that can only accelerate that.","So, we feel really good in terms of our set-up for 2019 to continue to build out and grow the Information Governance and Digital Services. And we've had a great last couple of years in terms of growth and we expect that type of growth to continue. I think the transportation to me now is, it's still waning a little bit, but it's being more than offset by our growth in Shred and in IGDS.","And then going into 2019, I'll turn it over to Stuart, is that the paper prices are an impact in terms of what 2019 will look like.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. So just to quantify the impact of paper prices, were paper prices to revert back to the historical three-year average from where they are today, that would be about a 100-basis-point impact on service internal growth.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue management approach. Do you believe some of the elevated destructions are a result of customers revisiting these boxes under a higher pricing scheme?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","It's a good question, Sheila, and we continue to monitor it. We don't see \u2013 it could on the margin, but we don't see a major link in terms of what we're doing on pricing in terms of increasing destruction. The major increase in destruction, as I said, was in part by the GDPR coming into effect at the end of May. So, that was forcing people to re-look at the way that they retain Personal Identifiable Information. By the way, it also leads to more opportunities on the IGDS, I should say.","And then, the other part is is we have seen a deceleration in terms of incoming volume from verticals \u2013 or from customer segments. I should emphasize that virtually every customer segment is still sending us new boxes, but as the rate has reduced over the last months is what happens is that you get a deceleration of incoming, the boxes that they've already sent us are not being replaced at the same rate.","And, generally, what we find is in the 0 to 7 year mark is when people more \u2013 it's usually around the 7 to 10 year mark is when people do their destructions. If they keep things over 10 years, it tends to be kept for very long periods of time. So, it's in that 7 to 10 year \u2013 the number of boxes that are in the 7 to 10 year mark is the one where we see the destructions happen. And if incoming boxes are coming in at a slower rate, then you get an imbalance between what's being destroyed at year 7 or 10 versus what's coming in.","So, we just have to kind of go through this process of albeit it's still positive incoming volume, but get that into balance and then we expect it to even out over time.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","The other thing I'll add, Sheila, is just to remember, so if you look at implied price in North America Records Management, it's about 3%. So it's nothing really extreme. It's just higher than what it was historically. And you also have to remember, this is a pretty small part of people's cost base in terms of where they're trying to save money.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Just one follow-up question on margin. It was positive to see EBITDA margin increase 80 basis points in the quarter. Just wondering when you look at your mix adding the increase in the data center percentage, just the outlook of margin trends' bigger picture over the next few years.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. One thing. If you look at the margin trends in the quarter, we're impacted also by the increase in service revenue, which is a lower margin business. Over time as the data center business continues to grow, that will be at a higher average margin in the rest of the business. So you'll get some positive mix impact from that.","So, if you go and you look at our 2020 guidance, that implies basically from where we are at 2018 of 200 to 250 basis point margin expansion over time. So a lot of that will come from the continuous improvement initiatives that we have, around cost of sales, SG&A, obviously the pricing flow through on the revenue management that we were talking about a little while ago, as well as we'll continue to get margin expansion in emerging markets as we lever up with \u2013 continue to grow those businesses and get the leverage of higher revenue on a fixed cost base.","So, every part of that business should contribute including data center growing as well as the margin there expanding from where we are today.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll just keep going with the margins here. We've heard a lot of kind of outsourced business service companies talking about the impact of the tight labor market, as well as fuel costs. Stuart, probably for you, can you just comment on how that affected the quarter and how that's impacting your outlook as you move into 2019?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. If you look at what's going on in the \u2013 actually in labor in the third quarter, actually was one of our biggest margin improvement drivers and that's continuing synergies from Recall. So, actually if you look at our current results, actually our labor was favorable. Some of that are also driven by the health and welfare costs as we've changed our provider and continue to manage those costs well.","The other side of it, if you look forward, we are seeing labor pressure and there's lots of demand for warehouse workers and for drivers. There is a somewhat of a pass-through to our customers in terms of the revenue management, right? It's one of the things when we're talking to our customers, they understand that there's a labor inflation going on out there, so it's one of the reasons that we're able to get the pricing float that we do.","In fuel which we mentioned, fuel, there's \u2013 that we do have a fuel surcharge that we can pass through to our customers as well when prices move up.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. Just one thing I'll just add, Andy, to Stuart's comments is that the fuel, let's just say, from most of the logistics companies is positive, but the other thing is, is that we still have a long way to run in terms of the productivity that we think we can drive. So, whilst at one level, you're right, the competition for warehouse workers and drivers is keen. On the other side, if you look at this year, we consolidated 30 facilities and we expect to consolidate another 19 next year. So, we are looking for ways to continue to streamline our back end. It allows us to get more labor productivity.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Helpful perspective. Thanks on that. Just on the data center strategy next kind of to finish up on this one at least for me. Previously, I guess you reiterated the greater than $200 million of revenue. I think, previously, you guys talked about a little bit more EBITDA than you signaled on this call. Just curious as to what the differential is on that. Is it just \u2013 is it timing of when some of these kick in? Is it the rates that you're able to achieve, maybe just kind of an update on kind of on the lease-up and the profit margins that you expect here?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I'm glad you asked the clarifying question. The numbers in my script included integration costs. So, we've talked previously about exit run rate and we're right on track with those numbers.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","About $10 million of EBITDA.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes. About $10 million more of EBITDA over what the 2018 number is when you look at the exit run rate.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Nathan Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets","Yes. Just to kind of follow up on the data centers, I believe you said it's around 8% of EBITDA in your prepared remarks. When we think kind of long term maybe five years plus, how should we think about where that percentage could migrate to? Could we get to a level that could be 30%, 40% data centers for you guys?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So, Nathan, I think, at this point, we've only guided out to 2020. So, what we thought \u2013 so, yeah, I'd love to give you a longer-term guidance, but so good try. But, anyways, in 2020, we've guided it will be about 10% of our EBITDA. But if you \u2013 you can even see it at 10% given the growth rates that we're getting. That's why we're saying this is driving 1% to 2% of the consolidated EBITDA growth just in and of itself. So, it's already becoming an important driver towards our march to 5% EBITDA growth in 2020.","And just a reset because I know that you've come on to our story recently, when we started this journey before, we were only at about 2% organic \u2013 even a little bit less than 2% EBITDA organic growth. So we're actually making good progress and data center has already proving to be a large component. But we'll keep you updated as we start extending our horizon beyond 2020 in terms of how we see that shaping up. But you can expect it to be, continue to be a major driver in terms of our EBITDA growth.","Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets","Sure. And maybe you can comment just on potentially converting some of your storage facilities to data centers. I remember you guys saying when you did the EvoSwitch transaction, there was I think a few facilities nearby that were storage facilities that you could convert. So I'm just wondering if you did an analysis kind of across the rest of your portfolio and just wondering how many centers could maybe be converted over time?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","It's a very good question. So you're right. I'll be specific. In Amsterdam, there is a facility that we're looking at Amsterdam to do exactly that. And there's two other facilities in North America one which we've gone to a fair amount of detail and it's associated with a potential customer. And then in other case, it's because of the advantageous power rates that we can get because of our historical footprint. So there's two facilities in the U.S. that we're actively look \u2013 two locations in the U.S. we're actively looking at. And then obviously you just highlighted the Amsterdam one which we've talked about before. So those are three areas where we continue to develop our thinking.","Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick final question. Can you talk a little bit about the China storage acquisition and kind of how you view the long-term opportunity in China? Is that a large untapped market for you guys?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, it was \u2013 it's a really good question. So, China is growing low-double digits in terms of organic volume growth. So, it is an important market for us and we are now the leading international player. We were before, but now we're firmly the leading international player in that market after this recent acquisition.","There are two parts of the Chinese market, so I feel really good about our ability to serve multinationals in the China market. And the way we approach the market, the types of services we provide is very familiar with them because they expect that kind of service everywhere they go in the world. The other part of the market is the state-owned enterprise in China. And we do have some state-owned enterprise customers, but that's an area which is more difficult to penetrate quite frankly as a multinational.","So, our business case and business plans associated with China are more around serving multinationals or Chinese companies that are looking for that kind of service. And, over time, we think we will be able to access more fully say the state-owned enterprise channel. But, right now, I would say our state-owned enterprises and as you know is a big part of the Chinese economy is relatively limited.","Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Michael Cho in for Andrew. I just had a follow-up on the margin discussion that we just had. I guess, first, the clarifying question was does the change in the margin guide for 2018 is just a difference in business mix?","And two, just more longer term, Stuart, I know you gave some color on it. But, historically, we've thought about Iron Mountain's margin expansion from really two buckets of Recall and transformation or efficiencies, and then I realized there's pricing and other efficiencies in data centers that you talked of. Can you just help us frame a little bit better the magnitude of contribution from some of those pieces that you mentioned as we go from 34.0% margins to 36.8% at the midpoint in 2020?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, Michael. So, first of all, yeah, the 2000 \u2013 in terms of taking the revenue guidance up and keeping the EBITDA guidance largely the same, it is primarily mix and really in the service business and you can see that obviously the internal growth on the service side.","So, then, if you take that and look forward to the sort of the 250 basis point margin improvement, then that sort of is implied from the current midpoint of guidance in 2018 to sort of the midpoint of 2020 in terms of what that plan is. The 250 basis points, I think you can think about it in the sense that about half of that will come from continuous improvement and cost reductions. Bill touched briefly on productivity improvements we think we can keep making.","And then, on top of that, then you'll get some mix benefit from data center as the data center margins itself grows, as those businesses integrated, as well as that business growing. And then, you'll get leverage in emerging markets from M&A primarily as well as organic growth as we've over time built up the infrastructure to support a larger business. And you continue to see the margins in emerging markets expand quite nicely and then margin expansion in developing markets in addition from the continuous improvement also coming from revenue management.","Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Eric Compton of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to kind of switch back to the volume growth kind of discussion. So, I guess, first, as people are changing, not bringing as much physical paper storage or whatever and they're switching to digital, do you guys disclose any numbers on what percentage of the business is being replaced kind of with these digital initiatives?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","No. I mean, other than the segments we already report, no. But, also, let me just kind of put it back into context. So, if you look at the math that Stuart took you through and let's take the year two because the year two is after you don't get the benefit for the one-time charges when people actually pull things out for destruction is that we're talking about at the rates that we're seeing around a $2 million EBITDA impact because, remember, he gave you an example that's 10 times anything that we see or expect to happen in what we can see going forward.","So, this is really a very small impact. I mean, on a business that's approaching $1.5 billion for that matter in EBITDA, but over $1.4 billion as we sit here today, a couple million in EBITDA associated with this trend is de minimis, so it's not a major thing.","We don't break out the segments more fine than you want, but on the other side is where if you ask me the question a different way, are we getting more than $2 million of EBITDA from our uplift in IGDS services or Information Governance and Digital Services, absolutely. So, we're more than getting \u2013 we're getting \u2013 as we're helping our customers on this digital transformation journey going from the \u2013 in this hybrid world is we're more than picking up what we're losing on the volume side. So, it's not one versus the other.","Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Got you. That's super helpful. And then, my last one is, you said you kind of expect some of the change in customer behavior with this volume to potentially reverse over time. Is that just related to kind of, if I understood your first example correctly, kind of a silly example, you might have a client that was previously bringing maybe five boxes a year and now they've changed to four, so you'll kind of get that one-time downdraft. Then as long as they stay at four, kind of that initial decrease will sort of reverse so to speak. Is that kind of the main driver there or are there any other kind of longer term reasons you'd expect this kind of acceleration in declining volume to reverse? Thanks.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. You've got it. Absolutely. That's exactly the dynamic is going on. And then the wildcard, so to speak, on the up side is that if some of the un-vended market or less vended markets that we've talked about before is those things start coming in and those things can kind of offset that while you're going through that process. But that process alone is the thing that's the key driver at this point.","Operator","The next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Stuart, I think you said in your comments that there was about $30 million of business changes that drove the AFFO guidance increase. Can you just detail what contributed to that $30 million?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Karin, I think probably the easiest thing to do is to refer you to the year-to-date calculation in the supplemental of the reconciliation of AFFO. But a couple things that I talked about is, you've got taxes coming in lower than we originally expected, interest expense is favorable from a capital standpoint, continuing to focus. Yeah. I should also refer you back to the guidance page as well where you see some of the detail, but some of the efficiencies that we're getting around maintenance capital as well as then just sort of the underlying business performance. Those are the key drivers, and I did mention that of the total $40 million increase in the AFFO at the midpoint, about $10 million of that is from better flow-through to AFFO of revenue recognition change. So I did want to call that out because that is different than our previous guidance as well.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And I wanted to go back to that volume loss example that you described. You're expecting continuing volume pressure next year on top of what we've seen this year. So, if you think you'll see a bigger impact in year two versus year one, given the fact that you no longer have the fees offsetting, should we expect more pressure on revenue next year given that sort of pattern there?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So I think as Bill discussed with \u2013 the trends that you see are really incredibly small, right. So, even if it was the same global volume declines we saw now, it was around $2 million. So, the example I gave is what I would probably classify almost as an extreme scenario, right, 10 times what we're seeing today. And which Bill talked about was easily offset by digitization services, but there's lots of other things we can use to offset that as well.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Got it. But understanding that the numbers are in the $2 million range, just trend wise, we should expect to see a little bigger impact if volumes continue to come down next year versus what we saw this year, right?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","It's not a \u2013 we expect it to maintain around this level, Karin. So, we're not seeing a compounding effect if that's what you're getting at.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. That was my question.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So, we're not talking about next year would be compounded on top of that. We would see it at a similar level as what we have now. Yeah.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Great.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","That's what we're planning for and then we'll issue guidance in February.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. Just a question on pricing; so developed market internal revenue growth was 70 basis points. That was a 60-basis-point deceleration from the 2Q level. The volume deceleration was only 30 basis points. So, should we read into that that you're getting less benefit from pricing and revenue management from 2Q to 3Q?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","No. And I know it's always hard to put together because we do it on two different bases. But if you're just kind of trying to do the rough mathematics, it's still that we're getting kind of high 2% range for North America and on a blended basis, you're getting the mid-2%s across the globe. So, it's still in the same range.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. And then, last question's just on data center. So, it looked like in the supp, there were a few changes to your investment volume and timing on a few of the different projects, Arizona being the biggest. You talked about that one. It also looks like Northern Virginia and then in the Boyers and Other category, there were some investments you showed in 2Q that are no longer there. Can you just talk about what those changes were?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. In the supplemental and the development activity, we actually added more detail to clarify sort of what's actually under construction today versus what's future construction. So, we broke those pieces out because there were some things that were \u2013 that are held for future development and able to be built up, but not currently under construction. So, we just broke those pieces out for you. So, the data is still there. It's just in separate columns.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Got it. And can you just talk about the size \u2013 the potential size on your return expectation on the new Chicago development?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","It's still early days in terms of what it's going to be. We're in the process right now as Bill talked about in the script. This is \u2013 the Pritzker Realty Group has got land in the Chicago market that is currently being prepared. They're doing site preparation work now. We will develop about 36 megawatts on that site is what the plan is. It won't actually start construction probably until \u2013 it could be late Q4, probably in the first quarter. And so, we're mentioning this today. We'll put out a formal announcement to the broker community soon so we can start pre-leasing on that.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","And you'll buy the land and provide the capital for the project?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","The land will actually be contributed. So, it'll be \u2013 it's not a legal joint venture. It's structured as a land lease, but it'll basically operate like a joint venture where the Pritzker Realty Group can participate in the upside as they help us with \u2013 in the Chicago market with local companies and things like that. So, they've got some skin in the game as well and get part of the upside.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. Hey, just one thing I wanted to \u2013 it feels like the business is a little less predictable just kind of looking at kind of the pure storage versus service components over the course of this year. So, what I want to do is there any way to frame out like what the delta is between kind of the step-up in the service because it looks like this service has been over kind of 7%, which is a great outcome for you folks. But how much of that is kind of sorted office paper, how much is the pickup and destructions, and then how much of that is the new GMBS (sic) [GDPR] initiative? And that was actually my first question. And then, just what percentage of the EBITDA today is sorted office paper?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","If you go back and look at \u2013 if you look at total Shred business, Kevin, you've got about a third of that is from the sale of paper. So you can go back and...","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","...sort of do the math on that. If you look at sort of third quarter, total shredding revenue was up about 15% or $15 million year-over-year. And if you remember, from a paper pricing standpoint, last year was actually a little bit of a dip compared to where we are this year. So, of the $15 million increase, about $6 million to $7 million of that increase is paper price. And the rest really has to do with volume in bin tips as the business continues to grow. We've done some tuck-ins as well in that business. And so, you've seen good margin expansion in the performance. Business is performing really, really well.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","But I think, Kevin, just to pick up on your predictability, as you've been following this story for a long time, so you kind of go back is when you first started, we were 2% organic EBITDA growth. We're seeing here 4% EBITDA growth. The company was struggling to maintain $900 million of EBITDA. We're now approaching $1.5 billion of EBITDA.","So, when we talk about $6 million or $7 million coming from paper, this is \u2013 quite frankly, I'm not complacent. I chase every million dollars, but this is noise in the way we run the system. So, if you sit there and say we're approaching 5% EBITDA growth organically before we do an acquisition whereas when you started following us, we were less than 2%, is the business is a lot easier, it can take a lot more noise in the system than it used to. So, I actually think the predictability of the robustness of the businesses is really strong.","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then, just, Stuart, the delta because it looks like the storage revenue, the guide for the full year came down to 2.5% to 2.75% versus 3% to 3.5%. Does that imply that back half deceleration and was that primarily all volume-driven? Is it kind of took those numbers down?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. I mean you see it in the year-to-date numbers, so it is primarily volume-driven in the storage side. As well, the offset looking forward, right, some of the other storage businesses as companies get more digital, we continue to invest in Iron Cloud and Iron Mountain in the InSight product that we're offering. So, we're continuing to talk to our customers about what needs they have. And so, going back to sort of Bill's point on the predictability, these are numbers despite us actually increasing investments in some of those new businesses.","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood.

(Broker)","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Operator","Good morning. My name is Kwashia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Ms. Melissa Marsden, you may begin your conference.","Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Kwashia, and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Stuart Brown, CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","As we've done for the last several quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations\/Financial Information.","Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 and 2017 preliminary financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's slides, our earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to those measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting a solid quarter, and I'm also happy to be partnering with Stuart Brown for his first Iron Mountain quarterly conference call.","Stuart's been on board since the time we reported Q2 and has been spending a lot of time in the field, familiarizing himself with the business and working closely with Rod during the transition. Stuart will deliver financial highlights in just a bit.","For the third quarter, we delivered revenue and Adjusted OIBDA results right in line with our expectations and notably drove our Adjusted OIBDA margins back to 31.2%, more in line with historical norms prior to integrating the historically lower margin Recall business. In addition, we continued to see consistent trends in our core business with positive internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in developed markets, a greater portion of our revenue coming from faster-growing emerging markets and good momentum in our adjacent business segment, particularly data center.","As noted last quarter, due to our quick actions, we are getting Recall integration synergies faster than expected. In fact, we now expect to exit 2016 having achieved more than 85% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year end 2017. This is up from 80% in our Q2 call, and we continue to expect in-year synergies to be $80 million. It is this achievement of getting synergies faster and the added benefit from our transformation initiative, which is the fuel that allowed us to increase the dividend per share starting in Q4 by 13% from $0.485 to $0.55 per share. As you will recall, this is in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day a year ago, but we are achieving it a full quarter earlier despite closing the Recall transaction later than originally expected.","Before going into Q3 performance, let me first provide a little more color on the Recall integration. As we've noted in the past, the Recall transaction benefits us in three primary ways. First, the level of synergy enables meaningful growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution, which funds increasing dividends and provides cash for continued investment in the business, all whilst over time delevering.","Second, it strengthens our ability to reach the high-margin mid-market business, where Recall had a strong presence compared with Iron Mountain's enterprise focus. And third, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets, giving us more exposure to these faster-growing and attractive markets.","As noted in the past, integration efforts will increase the Recall base margin business, which has historically operated at 600 basis points to 700 basis points lower than ours in three areas: SG&A; labor; and in the longer term, real estate consolidation benefits. We also continue our detailed review of our real estate platform, as we consider further consolidation opportunities, which we believe can provide additional, benefit over time. Further, the growth in cash flow allows us to invest in new products and innovation for the benefit of our customers, innovation around areas from how we bundle services in simplified pricing, to utilizing excess building capacity for other types of storage, to leveraging our sector-leading knowledge to offer technology solutions to our customers.","An example of this is our Analytics Dashboard that we recently introduced to help records and information managers demonstrate the effectiveness of their information governance program and uncover the value of their data. The Dashboard help them manage retention schedule, improve inventory tracking, identify potential risk and compliance concerns, and conduct internal and peer benchmarking of best practices. In addition to improving tools such as the Dashboard, we're also testing better and easier ways for customers to interact with us through mobile devices that enable voice recognition.","When we refer to innovation, we're talking about tapping the ideas our customers and employees have for new products and solutions, vetting them and then incorporating them into our customer solutions and processes in order to further strengthen our differentiation and profitability. We have discussed some of these items previously, such as our emerging partnership with the likes of EMC\/Virtustream, and now, Dell, in building air gap, which provides customers with the added cybersecurity all of us seek.","It is these innovations and others, which not only provide additional value to our customers, but will also add to future earnings growth both as stand-alone products as well as further differentiating our existing offerings. We're planning to host our next Investor Day in late April 2017, at which time, we intend to share a few of these innovation ideas with you. We'll also have about a full year of Recall under our belts by that time.","In addition, we continue to make progress on the dispositions required by the regulators. You may have seen that just last week we received approval from the ACCC, or the Australian regulator, for the disposition of our legacy business in Australia to Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm. This AUD $70 million transaction closed yesterday.","In addition, we continue to make progress on the sale of the required assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We're pleased with our progress on these dispositions, and we'll bring you updates as those transactions are approved by the regulators and closed.","We now expect that total dispositions will generate approximately $185 million in gross proceeds compared with our initial estimate of $220 million. Whilst this total is a bit lighter than we originally expected, we are pleased with where we've landed and believe the transactions are consistent with our commercial goals in those markets.","Let me now turn to some highlights before Stuart walks you through the details that can also be found in the bridging graph in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was up more than 27% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage rental and service revenue. Adjusted OIBDA as I mentioned at the beginning is back to nearly our high levels before the acquisition with Adjusted OIBDA margins up 150 basis points from Q2.","On an internal basis, storage rental growth was 2.6%, and we continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth, which excludes the initial Recall volume we added when we closed the transaction was positive in all storage segments and at 1.8% for the quarter. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration related activity. Year-to-date, service revenue was basically flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of the projects. Based on our service project pipeline, we expect internal service revenue growth to be roughly flat for the full year.","As we've talked about on previous calls, given our expected change in service mix, we continue to focus on improving service gross profit and protecting returns on invested capital rather than on service gross margins. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvement in our service business, but it's important to keep in mind that 83% of our gross profit is from storage. Whilst we continue to devote a fair amount of attention to how we can grow and enhance our service business, our service lines first and foremost, provide a strong differentiation to our core storage business.","Turning to progress on our strategic plan, which entails getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expanding in faster-growing adjacent businesses, we continue to make progress on each of these pillars and the foundational elements that support them.","In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we added 3.6 million cubic feet of internal volume growth. North America RIM storage growth was 1.1%, reflecting positive volume growth. This is all before the impact of Recall and any other acquisitions during the period.","In emerging markets, it is important to note that these markets are differentiated through higher levels of internal storage growth of roughly 10%. Our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale to drive these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020.","You may remember, we announced the beginning of this journey about three years ago, where we started at 10% of our sales coming from this fast-growing segment. By the beginning of this year, we had approached 16% of our sales coming from emerging markets. And now, with Recall's footprint, we are at 17.1% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis.","Whilst we did not close any international acquisitions during the quarter, we continue to expect total M&A investment in the range of $140 million to $180 million this year, having closed on roughly $56 million year-to-date excluding Recall. More specifically, we expect four significant transactions in the emerging markets to close in Q4, which will utilize about $75 million of the remaining M&A budget.","In addition to this final stage pipeline in the emerging markets, there are a number of smaller tuck-ins mainly in developed markets, which are expected to close. An example of this focus and continued execution can be readily seen in our Southeast Asian markets plus China. At the start of the year, this region represented just $14 million of annual sales. With the acquisition of Recall and upon closing the Santa Fe transaction we discussed last quarter, we'll have grown our business in this region to annualized revenue of more than $100 million, with leading positions in virtually all countries where we operate within the region.","In our adjacent business segment, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we announced a major lease in the quarter in our purpose-built Boston data center with SimpliVity, a leader in infrastructure enterprise IT. SimpliVity needed data center resources to support its engineering lab, and our colocation solution was the right fit from a cost, capacity, efficiency and security perspective. They noted that our 65-year track record of protecting proprietary assets gave them the confidence to trust a third party with such an expansion.","In addition, a couple of weeks ago, we broke ground on construction of the first building of our 83 acre data center campus in Manassas, Virginia using a development partner for this first 150,000 square foot data center. This building will deliver superior physical security, lower power costs and a reduced tax structure compared to other national locations.","In total, our Northern Virginia data center campus will support 42 megawatts of critical load spread across a planned four individual colocation facilities. This represents a four times expansion of our current capacity. The first building expected to open in summer 2017 will offer 10.5 megawatts of critical power and a flexible design that can meet the more exacting requirements of cloud service providers, federal government, system integrators, financial service firms and healthcare companies. It will also comply with federal technology and environmental regulations, enabling federal agencies and integrators to comply by stated deadlines for efficient, sustainable data centers.","We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business and are continuing to manage capacity utilization to stay ahead of demand whilst benefiting from pre-leasing activity in existing markets. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds of Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our data center space is greater than 90% committed. And we are on track to achieve internal growth of 20% to 25% in this business area. Whilst we don't break out our data center business separately in our financials, we continue to achieve top line organic growth in this business. And we expect to end 2016 with an exit run rate of $25 million in sales, which compares favorably with our 2015 exit rate of $20 million.","In terms of supporting foundations for the strategic plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. We expect to action an additional $18 million of savings by the end of this year, bringing us to $100 million in run rate savings to be recognized in 2017. Whilst we didn't incur much in the way of additional cost in Q3, we laid the groundwork for improvements to be implemented next year focused on achieving the final $25 million of this $125 million program.","Given the timing of Recall synergies, our transformation program, and positive business trends, we remain confident that we will generate cash flow in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and updated in recent presentations. This provides the foundation for our dividend growth.","Our newly declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share equates an increase of about 13%, reflecting the benefit of synergies and transformation. Our expectations continue to be \u2013 to grow the underlying business and cash flow, which will support an increase in our dividend per share by an additional 7% in 2018, and 4% annual growth thereafter in line with our strategic plan whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments.","As we progress our plan, we'll generate more cash available to support discretionary investments. So we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to delever. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles.","We have a durable storage business that generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage real estate sectors.","Our lack of volatility through economic cycles and business durability clearly distinguishes our business. It is this durability that delivers consistent operating performance with high rates of utilization and stable pricing in both good and bad economies.","Another thing that distinguishes our business is our relative insensitivity to higher interest rate compared with most REITs. First, our customers' storage needs are largely unaffected by interest rate movements. Second, our core storage NOI doesn't change with the value of the underlying real estate. Third, we incur virtually no TIs or tenant improvements, if a customer leave and we bring in a new one.","Importantly, we have an operating business and we effectively control real estate through long-term leases with multiple lease extension options and direct ownership in strategic locations of about one third of our properties.","In an increasing rate environment, this structure reduces our exposure to real estate value fluctuations compared with REITs that own their entire portfolios. Additionally, it should be noted that we generally enjoy higher levels of real price increases during periods with more inflation.","In summary, it was a solid quarter with good execution on all three pillars of our strategic plan even in the midst of the Recall integration. We achieved solid internal and constant dollar growth, continued volume increases, and meaningful expanded OIBDA margins all of which support increased cash flow and the 13% increase in our dividend per share.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be a part of Iron Mountain and working with mountaineers around the globe.","The durability of Iron Mountain's records management and related businesses and the substantial opportunity to continue to optimize performance following the Recall acquisition and through our strategic plan is just part of what drew me to Iron Mountain. I am really pleased that our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute. There are many opportunities ahead, and I believe it's a very exciting time to be a part of the team.","Before diving into the details of our financials, let me take a moment and walk you through the key highlights of the quarter. First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, excluding Recall and other small acquisitions. This compares with 2.1% last quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets.","Making up over 80% of our gross profits growth in the storage rental business remains our key execution focus. Second, we enhanced our profitability. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 150 basis points from the second quarter, as benefits from the transformation program and synergies from the Recall transaction flow into our results.","Third, we are making great progress on the integration of Recall and over 85% of the $115 million of 2017 growth synergies will be in process by the end of this year. Fourth, since June 30, we completed approximately $380 million of debt refinancing at attractive rates, including the recent $50 million mortgage, resulting in about 74% of our debt now being fixed after paying down the revolver in early October, and that compares to 68% in the second quarter.","Our average maturity was 5.1 years and our weighted average interest rate was 5.1%.","Our Canadian debt offering tied to the lowest coupon ever in the high yield Canadian market demonstrating our debt investors' appreciation of our solid cash flow and recognition that our leverage is in line with many investment grade REITs.","We remained steadily on track to deliver on short term financial objectives and long-term goals. And as Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth, the durability of our cash flows and capital efficiency that our board of directors increased our dividend by 13% to $0.55 per share.","Now that I've covered the highlights, I'll go over our worldwide financial results followed by a review of our performance by segment and conclude with the discussion on our outlook for 2016 and a preliminary view on 2017. Consistent with prior quarters, we provided bridging schedules for total revenue, Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted earnings per share, and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on pages 23 through 26 of the supplemental.","Let me walk you through the highlights. For the third quarter, our total reported revenues increased 26.3% or 27.4% on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal revenue increased 1.4% in the third quarter compared with a 0.4% increase in Q2, again with improvement in all regions and segments.","We expect total internal revenue growth in 2016 to be between 1.5% and 2%, reflecting continued solid performance in our higher margin storage activities and growth in adjacent businesses, offset by modest declines in service revenues.","Let's look at storage and service revenue performance in the quarter. Storage rental revenue is the core economic driver of our business, representing 61% of revenue and 83% of our total gross profit. As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter storage internal growth accelerated to 2.6% from 2.2% growth in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect full year storage internal growth of approximately 2.5%.","Service revenues which make up 39% of total revenues and 17% of our gross profit declined 0.5% from a year ago compared to a year-over-year decline of 2.1% in Q2. As we've highlighted in previous calls, the mix shift in our service business growth rates can be a bit volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, we expect internal service revenue growth to be about flat for the full year.","Total third quarter gross profit margin declined slightly from Q2 due mainly to the additional month of Recall results. As we've previously highlighted, Recall pre-acquisition, operated at a lower margin than Iron Mountain due in part to having higher rent expense as a percentage of revenue, as Recall lease almost all of their facilities.","However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies and other synergies to more than offset this margin decline resulting in expansion of Adjusted OIBDA margin. In the quarter, we grew total Adjusted OIBDA by 29.1% on a reported dollar basis and by approximately 30% on a constant dollar basis.","Importantly, Adjusted OIBDA margins expanded year-on-year and sequentially to 31.2% as we continue to see benefits from transformation actions and from Recall synergies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27; Adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the depreciation expense of legacy Recall racking structures.","As a reminder, the amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to funds from operations. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO. Normalized FFO per share was $0.44 for the quarter. The decline in FFO per share was driven by two factors.","First, the increased non-cash amortization of Recall's customer relationship intangibles as discussed back in April, that is not added back to calculate FFO. Second, is the tax impact of Recall related expenses. As most of the costs of this integration phase were incurred in our qualified REIT subsidiary, they did not provide a tax shield.","This last item also impacted our effective tax rate which appears high as the Recall costs and the $14 million impairment reduced pre-tax income, however they did not reduce taxes recorded in our taxable subsidiaries. This is a short term effect of the integration effort.","Third quarter AFFO was $169 million compared with $134 million in the year ago period, fueling our dividend increase. Remember AFFO adds back non-cash items such as amortization and non-cash or discrete tax items, so AFFO was not as impacted by the same items that impacted FFO.","Let's turn quickly to our financial performance by segment. Pages 15 and 16 of the supplemental outline our performance by segment in detail for the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis. Let me touch on a few highlights from these pages.","In North America Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 1.1%, reflecting strong internal volume growth, in North America Data Management or DM we saw a strong internal storage rental growth of 2.2% reflecting an improvement from the second quarter.","However, service internal growth declined due to the timing of projects and the ongoing reduction in tape rotation as we have discussed previously.","The Western European segment had 0.3% of internal storage rental growth, having been impacted by the carry forward of certain contract negotiations that we mentioned on our last earnings call. In the Other International segment, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth of 11.6% and 6.9% respectively.","Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and the costs that we have incurred so far to achieve synergies and integrate Recall with our business. Bill explained we remain on track to achieve the synergies in total, albeit we are getting there a bit faster. Our expectations of total cost to achieve synergies are still consistent with prior projections, $380 million and deal costs of $80 million.","In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur roughly $50 million in operating expenses, and $17 million in capital expenditures as we accelerate the cost savings programs. Year-to-date, Q3 we have incurred $103 million of integration in deal close costs and $7 million in capital expenditure. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q which will be filed later this week. Please note that these one-time items are excluded from our Adjusted OIBDA calculation.","Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 and preliminary outlook for 2017 summarized on pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged with consistent storage rental growth and accelerating growth in our International and Adjacent Businesses. In addition, our expectations for Recall's contribution and our standalone business contribution remain unchanged as seen in the table at the bottom of our guidance page.","Our guidance is now on a reported dollar basis given foreign-exchange differences during the year have been small and this now serves as the baseline for our 2017 outlook. Further, we have updated our 2016 FFO guidance to adjust for the increases in income tax expense, amortization and interest.","Our AFFO guidance remains unchanged at $610 million to $650 million reflecting savings we have identified in maintenance capital since the Recall acquisition, as well as non-real estate capital expenditures which were partially offset by increases in interest expense and cash taxes. However, we anticipate AFFO for the full year to come in above the midpoint of our guidance.","Our interest expense for the year is higher than we originally assumed due to the timing and amount of divestiture proceeds as well as additional Recall integration related spend. AFFO continues to provide ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Given the higher interest in taxes than our original guidance, we expect Adjusted EPS to be near the low end of our guidance range for the year.","Upon further review of Recall's real estate assets and overall systems requirements, we reduced our capital expenditure outlook, real estate and non-real estate maintenance as well as non-real estate investment by $25 million for 2016. The capital efficiency that is created by bringing the two businesses together is better than we had originally anticipated. Therefore, this is an elimination, not a deferral of spend.","In addition, we reduced our real estate investments by $95 million driven mostly by delayed spending on lease conversions and certain real estate development as we make sure we take the time to optimize each market's needs and negotiate with landlords to consolidate facilities in light of the Recall transaction. Note that the reduction in real estate spend this year is not impacting our synergy or margin outlook or 2020 vision as we know that these types of investments take a period of time to stabilize.","Distributions for the year will total around $500 million resulting in our dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO consistent with our prior guidance under 80%, and becoming more aligned with REIT peers over time.","Let's touch on our preliminary guidance for 2017 which is based on September 30 exchange rates. At a high level, this guidance is consistent with long-term expectations with slightly lower growth from acquisitions given our focus on Recall this year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect adjusted OIBDA to grow by 17% and AFFO to grow by 12% in 2017 compared with 2016. We'll provide more detail on capital allocation and other guidance for 2017 in February after we finalize prioritizing investments.","We expect maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments to be approximately $170 million next year, together representing roughly 4.5% of revenue consistent with 2016.","Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we currently have liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times as expected. In the short-term, given the timing of proceeds from the divestments, we expect to end the year at a leverage ratio around 5.8 times and to trend down from there in line with our 2020 vision.","Lastly, we continue to focus on strengthening our debt structure through increasing exposure to long-term notes and shifting a greater percentage of our debt to foreign jurisdictions, which creates a natural currency hedge to mitigate translation exposure while also being tax efficient.","In September, we raised CAD 250 million in senior notes at 5.375% due in 2023 and closed on a AUD 250 million dollar syndicated term loan B facility which matures in September 2022 and currently bears interest at 6.05%.","Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the progress we have made integrating Recall and executing on our transformation program.","Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our short term and long term financial projections. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our business and we are extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan and optimizing our costs.","Before closing, I want to mention that I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the team here at Iron Mountain. And appreciate the passion that our teams in the field have to care for our customers. Their focus on moving the business forward during a major acquisition integration was evident in the performance this quarter.","I continue to expand my knowledge of the Iron Mountain business and look forward to meeting with many of you in person over the coming months.","With that I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Stuart. We are pleased with our underlying results as well as our progress with integrating Recall and at a high level we should think about it as we've issued 20% more shares to purchase Recall. In less than six months in on a Q3 to Q3 basis we have seen revenues up 26%, Adjusted OIBDA is up 29%, and AFFO is up 27%. All this has allowed us to increase our dividend per share by 13% and do this three months sooner than predicted.","With that, I'd like to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, thanks, good morning. Now that more of your services business is project based, can you discuss how signings look for services and whether your signings trend support positive internal services revenue growth for full year 2016 and 2017?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Good morning, George. I think as we noticed what we expect is that service revenue for 2016 to be flat based on the pipeline that we've looked at, and then for 2017, we expect \u2013 we'll give you further guidance in February, but I think you can expect a slight improvement on 2017 based on what I see in the pipeline right now. But you're right, as we now have more and more is project based is we need to take that into effect as the core services decline as the business becomes more archival.","But right now, I would say 2016 is going to be flat, in 2017 we expect \u2013 we'll give you more later in February, but I would expect that it's going to be a slight improvement on 2016.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And can you, as it relates to Recall, discuss some of the early realization of the synergies you saw in the quarter, and what aspects of the transaction helped allow for this early realization of synergies, and then whether there is potential for additional upside beyond what you already see?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","That was a good try George. But I think you know what I'm going to say about the upside. Because right now we're very pleased that we're getting it faster. I think we're \u2013 we still remain optimistic that there'll be upside as when we get into the real estate consolidation, but obviously that's a longer term. I think the biggest fuel to being able to get it faster, the answer was cultural.","That when \u2013 you always \u2013 when you have a competitor across you, you always tend to think they are more different than yourself, but actually when we brought the two organizations, there was a lot of common understanding and common way of doing things. And the result of that was we were able to bring the teams together much faster, because especially these early synergies are mainly head count related.","So let's say we weren't \u2013 we are not going deeper than we expected in terms of the head count reductions, but the speed at which we were able to align processes and then release people was much faster than we plan. So I would say it's probably that the key driver has been cultural. But let's say in terms of further upside is we still remain focused, but we think there is going to be further upside when we start consolidating the facilities, but that's more in the midterm rather than the near term.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Another thing \u2013 this is Stuart. Another thing I'd add quickly is that just our procurement teams have done a really great job going through and comparing contracts too at the better pricing and starting to capture that upside. Everything from facilities, management cost in the third party that we used to help us with that to the paper business. So there's a number of things they are working hard on.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Very helpful. And then lastly, can you elaborate any one time items you expect to impact FFO and AFFO in 2017?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I'll let Stuart answer that. As he highlighted, is FFO looks a little bit odd right now because of some of the onetime issues in terms of bringing the two companies together and especially some of the integration costs wasn't tax deductible. But I don't know, Stuart you may want to comment in terms of how FFO gets normalized or starts running in more of a clean fashion (36:29).","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. We're starting to get more of a regular run rate, right? You'll expect on a year-over-year basis for the year you'll continue to see some amortization impact. The tax rate as well. While this year there has been some normalization items, so we brought our FFO guidance down this year. A lot of this has been due to integration costs and how those have hit. So our guidance next year for FFO in flowing all the way down has got a tax rate around 17% or 19%, so that's the only thing that will get normalized.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","And the one thing \u2013 just to add is that I'm not saying that FFO doesn't matter, but the thing that in terms of driving that cash both to invest in the business and dividend growth is obviously AFFO is the main thing because it's the more pure thing that has purely focused on cash, because as Stuart pointed out on FFO, there are some non-cash items that don't get added back to FFO where they do you get added back to AFFO. So not saying that it's not important, but the cleaner measure in terms of cash generation of the business going forward is for sure, especially the way our business operates is the AFFO metric.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions. Bill, what's going on with the North American Data Management Services line that was down 11.3% year-over-year last quarter, it was down 10.3%? We had a discussion about some tough comp on project related revenue. It seems to have worsened a little bit this quarter. What's the story behind that?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Good morning, Shlomo. So actually it's pretty much consistent with what we've said. I think I've always said on the calls for the last, I would say few quarters that it's really the transportation and I'd say that's generally down between high single digits, low double digits in terms of revenue. So it's continuing \u2013 we've continued to see the trend.","As I said before, I think on a couple calls ago, we see a kind of a flattening out of that archival drop in transportation when we look at the paper storage business or the record storage side of the business, but in the data management, it's still a little bit lagging that transition into becoming more about backup and recovery rather than rotating the tape.","So \u2013 and we still aren't declaring a bottom. So if you say going forward, I'd still expect that we're going to see transportation declines in the tape business still in the high single digit, low double digit level, so it's really \u2013 it's not the projects that are driving that. It's the transportation decline.","So I mean the good news if you look at the storage, as we said that the storage, both on a revenue and a volume basis, if you look at revenue quarter-on-quarter, we're up a little over 2%. If you look at a trailing 12 months in terms of volume, we're up 2%, and to keep in mind is if we look at the margins of the business and the profitability of the business, whilst I think services is important, it's first the most important in terms of differentiating our storage product because that's where we build the reliability in and through the robustness of our transportation, but the part that's driving the cash in the business, we continue to be pleased with.","But if you're asking me just specific on transportation, I have to say that I expect it to continue to decline in the high single, low double digits for a few more quarters because we still seem to be behind the transition that we've pretty much worked most of the way through on the records management side.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So I thought that that is true, but you typically get a certain amount of project related revenue and that helps offset it and you had a particularly strong project-related revenue quarter in 2Q 2015. And that's what made it tough to comp on that on 2Q 2016? Was I just misunderstanding how that was going through?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","No, no, you're right because it was kind of mid single digit decline, I think in the quarter that you're referring to, Shlomo, so you've got a very good memory. I think that specifically we do see \u2013 if you look at, especially in our film and sound, this includes our film and sound business, is we do have specific projects with some of the studios that rotate in and rotate out, and whilst it does drive the top line in terms of the revenue, again, if you come down to in terms of \u2013 if you backup and say, you see even though that we've lost that project which so you're now seeing kind of raw more the transportation decline and you see in some quarters, it hasn't affected our ability in terms of driving overall profit growth. But you're right, we do see those \u2013 and those typically, I'm not saying all, but most of those lumpy projects come in our film and sound unit.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then can you \u2013 maybe this is a question for Stuart, can you talk about the specific items that resulted in the FFO guidance, just go through them like one-by-one into it, what change from last quarter of \u2013 for 2016?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes, it's pretty simple really. So, if you look at the change in guidance which on a total dollars basis is about $80 million or at the midpoint on FFO was about $0.35, you get the biggest piece of it's tax expense and it's really about half of it, and the reason for that is that the integration costs out of Recall are really hitting in the REIT subsidiary, so you're not getting any tax benefit from those and that is different from what we had originally assumed.","You've got about a third of it is coming from the amortization of customer intangibles, right, that's really came out of purchase accounting and as we finalize purchase accounting, I'll point out that that's not in cash, so that you get that added back in AFFO. So that's about a third of it. And the last piece of it is really interest expense and that's the rest of it and that's really the timing as we talked about the divestment proceeds and a little bit lower proceeds from that on a cash basis.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So is it half from the first part of the integration of Recall cost or being in the REIT as opposed to not lowering the tax rate outside of the REIT?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. Yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I guess is that something that flows through in 2017 as well or is that something that we're kind of in since most of this has been actioned this year?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","It mostly will hit this year. There'll be a little bit next year. But next year we'll have it built into our \u2013 into the tax expectations in the guidance. We got that built in now, how that's going to flow through.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then the amortization of customer intangibles, hits the FFO, but not the AFFO because it gets added back. Is that the right way to understand it?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then the interest expense will hit both of them, right?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's just higher interest expense. Okay.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Why did the out-perms in other international step down, if you look at those bar charts that you give for storage, if you look at other international looks like 2Q 2016 minus 3.7, 3Q minus 4.5 what's going on over there?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I think we've \u2013 if you remember, we talked about there is a specific customer that we have in Other International that was going through a specific kind of \u2013 I would say a legacy destruction project. So you see that kind of still flushing through.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Do you know when does that end, so we could start \u2013 we'd start to see the trend going the other way?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I think we've been calling it out now for about three quarters, so I think we've got now one or two more quarters because it's a trailing 12 months, so you have to kind of see the 12 months. We can go back and check. But I think we've been calling it out for about three quarters, so you probably got one more quarter to kind of flush that through.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then what was the impact of the U.K. pound on the 2007 OIBDA guidance? Year-over-year....?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","You mean \u2013 You're asking the Marmite question, Shlomo?","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","The what question?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","The Marmite question. I don't know if you follow in the U.K. they're talking about the price of Marmite. So, right now it hasn't had a big impact to date because it's more of a translation issue. You're right, it does show up in our numbers, but it's a translation issue only at once you get to the profit numbers.","So we don't have the double whammy that some companies have where they have a manufacturing cost issue that they are selling into the U.K., and then they have the translation issue. So that being said, we are sensitive to the translation issue, but right now you don't see a major impact in the numbers. And we've built that in going into our guidance for 2017.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So is it fair to assume somewhere between 6% and 7% of revenue is U.K. pound and that just kind of drops down in the translation, either up or down depending on what's going on?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Actually not quite because when you go through the P&L, you remember when we had FX going against us for so many quarters over the past couple years, right. If you go from the top line, you start getting a dampening as you go down through the P&L, because we actually have costs in that local market that get absorbed that are also lower when you translate it. So it's a little bit less. You're right to think about it as kind of a start point, but it actually gets mitigated. I don't know Stuart if you want to talk a little bit more detail about it.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. When the Q gets published there is a line by line of all the currency changes, remember. And some of that currency change gets offset by the strengthening in Canada and some of the other currencies. So the net effect is not as big as you may think it is of that current, as it flows through the full P&L, but in the Q, we'll detail that out specifically.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi Stuart, you made a passing comment. And it was actually too quick for me, about CapEx for 2017. I think you referenced part of CapEx for 2016 and said it was about 4.5% of revenue. You said it might be the same next year. I assume you're talking about maintenance CapEx, so if you could just kind of bring us together on what you're willing to say about 2017 CapEx at this point.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. So, maintenance CapEx and non-real estate investments will be about $170 million, we've got built into guidance right now and again, we'll finalize that and update it in February if we need to. And so, total, together, is about 4.5% of revenue.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittman with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, great. So, I guess, my question, in North America, it looks like we had a little consecutive, or quarter-over-quarter acceleration in volumes, organic growth and that's all great, and you highlighted that. Could you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of some of the dynamics in the marketplace that are leading to a little bit better than last quarter's growth rates? Is it just \u2013 was it distraction maybe from integration, and now you're better integrated and can focus more? But some of your commentary around that, I think, would be helpful.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Well, I think you have to \u2013 good morning, Andy. I think that you have to kind of see the overall trend. If you go back kind of three years ago, right, I think we've been going at steady march forward. And I'm saying on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you can see some noise, like in any business, but if you think it on an annual to annual basis as we continue to march forward \u2013 and I think we're one of the largest implementers of salesforce.com. I think we've got the salesforce much more organized and aligned. We did the big organization three years ago. That's starting to bear fruit. And as you know, as being a long observer of this business, nothing happens fast, but you have to put certain foundations and building blocks.","So, my \u2013 I wouldn't say it's any one thing. I think a lot of it goes back to what we did. And I wouldn't say last quarter's performance was because of noise of Recall. It's just that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it does move around. But we're starting to see that whilst this isn't a high-growth business, there is still growth to be achieved which I know is counterintuitive, but I think this business will be running longer than the iPhone franchise, right. I mean, I know a lot of people in their stomach don't believe that, but if you look at the results, we continue to drive positive organic growth out of the business. And I think the new organization gets better and better every quarter of doing that. I'm not saying the sky's the limit, but I would continue \u2013 we continue to expect to get more out of even the developed markets on an organic basis going forward, albeit these are small incremental improvements, not large swings.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Then just \u2013 okay maybe another way to dovetail to that question is just with the integration of the two large global players, have you seen any competitive response from the competition, maybe the trends and the outlook for pricing, in particular, for national accounts? Can you talk about how those things have maybe changed since the closing of the deal?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Well, we don't think about pricing in isolation. What I do feel, I talked about it a little bit on my call \u2013 in my script, or when I was going through my remarks saying that innovation is an important part. And one of the things bringing the two organizations together, it gives us not only a larger customer base, but it gives us more capacity to innovate, and that innovation resonates with our customers.","What we're finding, especially for the regulated customers that have to worry about compliance in so many different jurisdictions, the fact that we can give them better solutions around information governance is a differentiating factor. And you can say, do they pay for the product, or do they pay more for the storage? And sometimes, it's built up in the storage cost or pricing and sometimes it's built up in the product, but what we do find is that the world is getting more complex, especially for the heavily regulated industries. And bringing the two companies together does give us more economies of scale to do that kind of R&D, and that is resonating with customers.","So I wouldn't \u2013 I think that's the way I think about the power of bringing the two companies together. It just gives us a deeper pool, if you will, to innovate around. And that \u2013 and so far, it's early days, but I've spent a fair amount of time in \u2013 with different customers. We had a top financial service customer forum in Louisiana in June. I just came back from one in Europe a couple weeks ago. And there's even more excitement that I'm hearing from our large customers about bringing the two companies together rather than less, because they're expecting even more in the way of innovation.","The other thing I would highlight is it's early days, but I also expect we've reorganized the North American sales force again a little bit in light of bringing Recall in. They were, as I said, much better at running after the middle market, which is a higher-margin segment. And a lot of it is unvended, and we haven't been as present there as Iron Mountain, whereas Recall was more present. And so now the head of North American sales is the person from Recall, who's driving the charge, not just in terms of our traditional segment in the enterprise, but he also has two new leaders that are helping drive more penetration into the middle market, which we expect over time to start coming through. It's early days, you don't see that in the numbers today, but I would expect to see an improvement in those areas.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Can you give us more color on why the proceeds you're expecting to receive from your dispositions are coming in below your previous expectations? And can you tell us what \u2013 just update us on what the OIBDA multiple is that you're selling those businesses at today?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Okay. Good morning, Karin. So I think that the \u2013 when you get into the \u2013 and you can probably appreciate I'm not going to give you probably as much detail as you want because of the confidential nature when you're dealing with both commercial parties, but also the different regulating authorities. But I think it's much \u2013 there is certain science about it. I mean, we had certain requirements that we have to hit, but when you actually start negotiating with sellers, each seller -each buyer, rather, I should say, has different parameters that they're interested in. And lining that up, that makes sense for the regulator and makes sense for us commercially is something that we work through.","So, I think, the \u2013 hence my comment is that we're lighter on cash that we're getting from these dispositions, but we're quite pleased in terms of where we're coming out commercially. So, I think, everybody wins on those things. So, I think, that's about all I can \u2013 I think you can probably appreciate that's all I can say given the confidential nature of these discussions. But I think it's a good platform. And you can see that in our guidance for next year. In other words, we're not taking down guidance for next year, because we ended up lighter on cash. And we still believe that we'll get to the leverage numbers that we expect.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. Is it just that the size of the businesses that you're selling is changing, or is it that the valuation is different than what you originally expected?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I think I'm just going to leave it there, Karin. I mean, I think you can probably...","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","...appreciate. But I think the best way to unpack it is if you look at the guidance we're giving for 2017 and beyond, as you say, I wouldn't even say it's noise in terms of our \u2013 you don't see a blip in terms of where we're going to end up in 2017. You definitely don't see any change in terms of where we're going to end up in 2020. So, I think, it's \u2013 these are \u2013 you think about NPV calculations, these are kind of trade-offs that you make between cash today, platforms, et cetera. So, I think, it's \u2013 we're comfortable where we came out.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. My second question is just regarding the line balance. Excuse me, it was $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Can you just update us where it stands today? And Stuart, I think, you mentioned plans to do more debt fixing in 2017. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you think is appropriate for the line balance to be on an ongoing basis?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah total \u2013 I don't have the line balance with me. Total liquidity right about now is about $1.1 billion. You got to remember, we did one of the debt offerings right at the very end of the quarter, so we had the cash sitting on the balance sheet and has not paid off the credit facility. And then in addition, in October, we did the $50 million mortgage notes, so that brought down the balance as well.","Sitting sort of fixed to floating, we call it, 74% today, we're continuing to sort of evaluate where we are in the cycle. I think, over time, you'll see us stay in the 70% to 80% range. My personal view would be to try to continue to push that up a little bit, given where the world is today. But we're right in the middle of what our target range is.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","But I think one thing Karin, just to keep in mind on that is we've gone from \u2013 the thing that I think is amazing in terms of the way that the debt markets have gotten the Iron Mountain story is we've gone from 68% to 74% fixed, and at the same time, we've taken our cost of debt \u2013 I mean, Stuart correct me, but I think it's down by about 80 bps or 90 bps in terms of the average cost of debt. We're now at 5.1%. And before we did this latest refinancing that fixed even more of our debt, we were at 5.8%, 5.9%.","So, to me, it's an interesting reflection that the debt markets definitely get the durability of Iron Mountain's business, and they're rewarding for it. So, if you think about where we are now, it's in a \u2013 we're in a much sweeter spot. Not that we're in a bad spot before, but we're in a \u2013 even a stronger spot in terms of the debt markets than we were a few months ago.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. I mean just compared to the end of last quarter, our average interest rate is basically flat despite fixing all that debt and terming it out, so.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thanks Karin.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...squeezing me back in. Just I'm trying to understand the difference between the FFO guidance last quarter and this quarter. I mean, I understand you're not going to include additional interest expense of debt due to future offerings. But wasn't the accelerated customer relationship intangibles known last quarter? And also, the costs coming out in the REIT subsidiary versus non-REIT subsidiary, is that something that's truly accounting? I mean, won't you understand that, that's really coming out in the U.S. versus some of the international geographies are really coming out in the areas that you had identified from beforehand?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Let me answer \u2013 I'll let Stuart address in terms of the intangibles flow through, but I think just specifically your question on the tax and where that flows through, I think you can kind of appreciate, when we knew the number of heads that came up \u2013 because the diligence on a public company is different than the diligence on a private company, so we had pretty clear view, and you can see that in terms of our improvement on AFFO of where we were actually getting the restructuring savings.","The issue is, and it's specifically in the U.S., right, because that's where we have the tax deductibility or non-tax deductibility, depending on if it's in the QRS or the TRS or the qualified REIT subsidiary or the non-qualified subsidiary is when we got into the U.S., a lot of the cost savings were in the part of Recall that would be in terms of the qualified REIT subsidiary. And that was where we didn't get the deductibility.","It doesn't affect international, because although we do have split between qualified in non-qualified subsidiaries, you remember that internationally we get fully taxed in those local entities, because the U.S. REIT rules don't apply. It's important in terms of the way we repatriate money back into the United States for dividends, but it's not important in the local tax scheme.","So, it's specifically a U.S. situation. And as we finished the restructuring, I'd say, there'll be a little bit more of that next year. And that's built into our guidance, because we now have clear view of what the restructuring is left that's in the qualified REIT subsidiary versus not, so we know where the tax deductibility is. But I think you can probably appreciate when you're buying a public company trying to have that level of detail until you actually get into the restructuring, that's where you get into the tax deductibility. But you think about it in terms of the ability, whilst cash taxes does affect AFFO as well, we're starting to actually get through those one-time restructuring charges, then we're still in line with what we think the total cost of the integration project is.","But I know \u2013 Stuart, you may want to talk about the intangibles.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah \u2013 no. The customer intangibles as well that was something that was highly influx last quarter, so we were \u2013 it started to flow through in the second quarter, but we were still between that and the racking in the lives of the assets and things like that. We're still working through a lot of those valuations, so we've not fully flowed that through our forecast for the rest of the year. So, could we have forecasted better? Maybe, but it's getting updated now.","The other thing I'd point out though to, as we've gone through and clean up and reconciled these things, I'm going to turn to AFFO for a second is if you go back and look at second quarter AFFO, we actually had understated that by around $10 million. That's because we had a \u2013 for Mexico REIT subsidiary, we had some onetime tax \u2013 integration cost or tax that we had to pay to restructure that entity. Those costs had actually been accrued as part of purchase accounting, never went through the P&L. Because it was a cash tax payment, it has actually gotten picked up as a reduction of the FFO last quarter, but it was one time in nature. Those are the types of things we exclude. So, if you go back and look at second quarter, AFFO was actually better and our trends, and that's one of things we talked about, AFFO guidance being above the midpoint for the year. That gives us comfort.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'm going to take the other stuff off-line. Thank you very much.","Stuart B.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q4 2011 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Stephen P. Golden","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2011 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2012 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed current report on Form 8-K filed on September 19, 2011, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.","As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release.","Before turning the call over to Richard, I would like to make a quick housekeeping announcement. As announced in this morning's press release, we have made a decision to sell our Italian business. As a result, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Italian business have been reclassified as discontinued operations. For your convenience, we have included the restated statements of operations for the 4 quarters and full years of both 2010 and 2011 in the appendix to today's presentation. Additional restated information will be posted to the Investor Relations page of our website. With that, I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.","C. Richard Reese","Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us this morning. As always been my prior custom on these Q4 calls, I'm going to focus today on the full year mostly of 2011 and reflect a bit on all the changes and, for that matter, the progress we've made since I've returned as CEO this last April. It's been a lot of change in the company, and it's important that our shareholders understand these changes and, as I said, the progress we've made against them as we've set forth the new strategy and focusing  our business.","So I'll let Brian cover the details on the quarter, except to say that Q4 was a good operating performance. We had consistent storage growth and great cost controls. I'll also speak a little bit about our outlook for next year. But again, I'll let Brian take care of the details, and he'll go through everything thoroughly. So with that said, let me get started.","Looking at the whole year on a performance basis, it was good performance for Iron Mountain. The key themes on an operating basis last year were, first and foremost, solid storage growth of 5% reported or 4% on constant currency. North America storage grew as we expected on a consistent 3% reported, 2% on a current basis -- or current constant currency basis, while International was strong at 14% reported or 9% on constant currency. And sometimes people ask me, and particularly, people haven't been around the company so long, why do we talk about storage so much? Why is it so important? Well, first is it is the major component of our revenue. It is the major driver of margin, and it frankly is the major consumer of capital as we grow. It is where we drive almost everything in the business. But it's also an indication of our relationship with our customers. Once they store items with us, it opens up the door for us to deliver other services on a routine basis related to those stored items, as well as sell them additional services or things we call complementary services and so forth. So we watch our storage foundation or annuity like a hawk. It is the flywheel that really drives the business. And 2011 was the 23rd consecutive year that we've grown our storage revenues, and through good times and bad, storage keeps chugging along with the business, and it's continuing do that.","Now we are continuing to see the same trends we did throughout the year of headwinds that weakening service revenues as customers use less of their information. They're becoming less active, in certain cases, change the way they use and, in many cases, continue defer buying decisions for projects that really are designed to improve their records programs. The trend towards less activity of information was felt broadly across all industries and all media types, not just in paper but our computer tape rotation services. The activity levels are down. We see it down, as I said, across the board. ","A key driver of this, as we've talked a lot about, is our health care, which is not a major factor in the storage side of our business, but it's also the most active part. It's really not an archival business. It's an active part. And this is the case where the health care industry is reengineering their workflow processes. This is a trend that's different than the last activity trend. This is a trend in which health care is changing modalities. They're changing how they operate, so digitizing images, going to MRIs and CAT scan modalities is replacing physical x-rays, which is one of our most active media. And of course, the adoption and broader adoption of electronic patient record systems will cause them to access their physical patient records less often. And we're seeing that trend. They don't destroy those records, and they actually do access them for different reasons, mostly around audit compliance and also a lot around research, where they really want to go back to the history of the record.","But those trends, we've been seeing for quite a while now, and they continued and they continued. That was one of the themes of 2011. Another key theme of 2011 was the move of recycled paper prices. We experienced very high recycled paper prices, in fact, hit an all-time high during the year. Those prices have come down sharply most recently and hit bottom and, frankly, we believe, just beginning to stabilize. This trend was helpful to us in 2011 but does present a challenge in 2012, and we'll talk more about that later.","All of this, really, was topped off by good underlying profit performance. Adjusted OIBDA margins were 31% for the year. International expanded their margins, which I'll speak much more about later.  It's part of our 3-year plan. They went up 220 basis points, primarily coming out of the United Kingdom, and strong emerging market performance drove those margins. North America performed as we asked them to and sustained their margins. We had, as you know, had optimized that business in the last 4 or 5 years and increased margins by about 850 basis points. We are at the stage of that business where the real strategic goal is to maintain margins and maintain growth, and they did both last year, even after absorbing an investment that we've talked about throughout the year, the $20 million increase in our sales and marketing investment. And of course, we had very good cost control at our overhead or our cost at our corporate level, so all in all, the team did a superb job of operating the business and delivering great financial performance.","These all numbers netted down to 24% growth in free cash flow dollars, starting with good operating performance, but also, it's our fifth consecutive year of improved capital efficiency, where CapEx for last year was 6.6% of revenue, down 130 basis points from the prior year. We also did get in that strong cash flow benefits from some cash timing that helped us, which you don't always see, as well as some tax incentives, too. Again, Brian will reflect on these in more details later.","So as I said, last year was a good year operationally. But as I've said in the beginning, last year is hallmarked by changes, so let me talk a lot about that. First and foremost is my return as CEO. For most of you who probably know me, it was a job I held for, I don't know, 25, 26 years, something like that, and I'm in my 31st year, I think, with the company. I might be a little bit off on the math, but close, directionally close. Net of that says I'm getting old. But I had gone for the job of the Executive Chairman and replaced myself as the CEO. But for lots of reasons, including the good work done by my predecessor, the company was on a path to shift strategies, but frankly, it made sense for me to come back. And it was a bit prompted by you, our shareholders, as the company had lost touch with some of you, and frankly, I've not done an appropriate job communicating these changes in strategy that we were both contemplating and implementing and, for that matter, not implementing them fast enough to have us all aligned. So when I came back, I did a couple of things. We announced a new 3-year strategic plan, which I'm going to go through with you in a second and just update you, but also committed to much, much more frequent and much -- very open communication with our shareholder base. I believe I've lived up to my promise, and this is the case, so I have a request of you. If you disagree with me, I really would appreciate you letting me know, and I think on that call, I gave you my phone number. I'll give it to you again. It's (617) 535-4800. And this is a serious request because I'm attempting to do some things that I think are important for the company, important for our shareholders, and sometimes, you need feedback.","So with that, let me also talk to you about our new strategy and our 3-year plan. As I said, when I -- we announced the plan, I said I would give you regular updates. We've been out on the road doing it. We've been doing it in our quarterly conference call. But let me look back in the plan now that's  almost a year old and just review with you what I think is outstanding progress by the team. ","The plan had 4 main elements. First was a focus on traditional physical storage and services business, the things that got us here, [indiscernible] got us to the dance. So as a net of that, we sold our Digital business in June for $390 million. It was a good transaction for us, and I think it clearly turned out to be a great transaction for Autonomy, the buyer. So I think we were all happy with the results of that. The second element of this strategy was a focus on return on invested capital. And to do that, we really looked at our business there in a couple of ways. First is we take it apart by segments. The North American segment, as I said, we had optimized that business, and so the whole strategy was sustain the high returns we had already created. And that was -- that plan is and remains to sustain their margin levels and continue to grow. And they grew at 2% and hit their margin targets for the year, as well as continue the improvement, invest in their own business. The real work was in International, and I have to say that the International management team, supported by people here at corporate and other parts of the world and, for that matter, some people in North America, everybody pulled together, and we really did some great work last year. ","It really has kind of 2 key themes. The first theme was to look at our business as a portfolio rather than as a broad footprint strategy. We built it as a footprint strategy, which means we acquired operations in broad geographies, and we really want a path to fill out the footprint. And we frankly just had gotten to the point where it was time to stop and say, \"All right, let's look at that footprint and understand what can be optimized, understand how we can drive returns and understand, in certain cases, whether what we bought makes sense or doesn't make sense.\" And we went through that portfolio analysis. That analysis is completed with the announcement today that we are going to place our Italian business on the market for sale, and we've started that process already, but it will, as I predict, will take some time. ","But in the International business, as I said, we've gone through that review. We also exited our New Zealand business, sold it for $10 million. And as I said, we've announced the plan to sell Italy. The rest of our businesses, and we've divided them as we've talked about in the plan, in different categories for where they stand in terms of mature markets, emerging markets, whether we have leadership or non-leadership. Though the return profiles of those business all look good, the work we've been doing and the work we have done say that they all can perform very well for us, and so now it's about hard work of blocking and tackling to get this portfolio to continue to move forward. And for that matter, continue  contributing growth and International did a great job on growth last year. And we expect -- if you look at this business, over the next 15 to 20 years, just to give you a broad view, is the last 20, 25 years in this business was driven primarily by North America going through an outsourcing trend, where legacy records and information moved from inside of companies to outside, to vendors like Iron Mountain. And even though there has been a consistent trend of reduction in use and activity of paper and creation, okay, over that time period, they've been a strong, steady growth in the business because of that conversion cycle. Being a very physical business, it takes a long time to make that happen. And by the way, that is not over in North America, but the denominator in North America, the size of the business is so large that -- and you can only sell so many, and you can only move so much in a year. We'll continue growing it, but it's not going to move the dial on growth rate. But International and, in particular, if you got to break International in a couple of components, there are more mature markets that look like -- and to that, look like North America, U.K. being a good example. And there are others who are maybe 10 years from looking like North America, but they will get there. But there are also markets, emerging markets as we broadly categorize them, and that would be in, obviously, BRIC, but it will also be in Eastern Europe and Latin America and places like that, where the markets have got 20 to 25 years of their pent-up demand of outsourcing, and those trends are beginning to happen. And we built the footprint so our strategy looking forward now that we have the portfolio in a position that we think is rationalized to continue to drive,  to capture that conversion over the next 25 years, and that will be more and more contributor to Iron Mountain's growth in the future as we go forward.","Obviously, it doesn't make sense to do that unless you're making money at it. And so the second big element of our strategic review, we said, \"All right let's step back and look at that portfolio and put in the kind of programs and the kind of work we've done in North America to drive up their margins  850 basis points and drive up our International markets.\" And we set a target of 700 basis points, challenged the team and said, \"By 2013, we want 700 basis points from you.\" And they rose to the occasion, made the commitment and then last year, delivered, I think, 220 basis points of that target and are on plan to do 150 to 200, give or take, this year and are working on their plans. And those plans are in the book, are in the bag. I mean, not that I've executed, but the plans are in the bag, and they're working on their plans for 2013.","So I'm very pleased by the performance. I'm very pleased by how fast we were able to take that business and frankly, reveal the real value we created. It was a case where I personally never had a doubt about the value, but it's also a case, as what I said in the beginning up here, we had lost touch with you as our shareholders. We have not done a good job of showing it to you fast enough nor getting you to understand that it was there. I personally think we're doing a good job with that right now. I hope you do, too. Net of all that is International, based upon their strong growth and margin accretion, returns on invested capital grew up to 8% north of our weighted average cost of capital. So -- and we've got significant more to come. So I think it's a great story there.","Now let me move on to the third element of the strategy. That element was a real strong focus on capital allocation. It's the right time in the company's life do that. This company was built as a capital consumer. We raised capital for many years in order to build out this global leadership of a great business. But you do that waiting for the day in which your capital needs are less than your capital generation and your capital capabilities, so to speak, and we've hit that inflection point. And so -- then it becomes, as you all know, the big argument of what are we going to do with it? Are we going to give it to you, or are we going to throw it away? And many of you worry that we, as management, will do stupid things and throw it away. Again, we probably didn't do a good enough job explaining to you that we weren't stupid. But -- and some of our performance, I can understand from your perspective, particularly on the Digital business, you were worried that we were going to do stupid things, that we were going to go spend billions of dollars buying technology assets. And regardless of what may have been said from time to time that might have given you that impression, the truth of matter is we look hard at all those opportunities and concluded that it did not make financial sense to Iron Mountain, and we had more financial discipline to that. That's also what led us to conclude that getting out of the Digital business, which, I believe, in the long run, still would have been a great thing to be in, but getting out of the business was the right thing to do because we could not get big enough fast enough given the pace at which the move  -- the business was starting to move around us, and nor were we willing to pay the prices that others were willing to pay in those markets. We couldn't make it make sense in our business. ","But having said that, look, we are being transparent about how we think about capital allocation, and there'll be more to come on that. But in April, what we announced was basically a plan to distribute $2.2 billion over 3 years, the term of our 3-year plan, back to our shareholders. And one of my first mistakes in that plan is I committed an absolute date for the first $1.2 billion, the mistake being not giving you the money. I just wish I hadn't put exactly a hard date on it because as soon as I said it and it came out of my mouth, I realized I was constrained about at what price I had to do certain things, and that took away some of my flexibility, which I don't like to happen to me. But nevertheless, we did it anyway. And so through a combination of increased dividends and share buybacks, through year end, we've distributed $1.2 billion, and we will complete that commitment with our next annual -- or our next quarterly dividend payment.","Through beginning -- well, through last year, we bought in 38 million shares or about 18% of the total shares outstanding. We did that through a combination of the proceeds of the sale of the Digital business. We took those proceeds and returned it back to shareholders. Increasing leverage from an all-time low, down under 3x, up to about close to 3.5x, about 3.4x currently, close, and in our range of 3x to 4x sort of thing. And we went to the market and raised some more high-yield in order to fund that leverage and, of course, as I've said, out of our free cash flow. So we're on plan to do that. The next $1 billion, we're on plan. We've got 2 more years. We don't have quite as hard a timetable as I've put on the first $1.2 billion, so we might take a little more flexibility of how we give it back to you, but we're on plan, assuming nothing changes out there in the future.","The fourth element, which could create that change, okay, is to look at structural alternatives. At this stage of the business, as I said, when you've reached that point at which you have excess capital, and it's always a question of the right way to allocate it, are -- we wanted to look at are there structural alternatives of ways of allocating capital and distributing capital back to our shareholders, including, obviously, our conversion to a REIT is one of them. That would create more efficiently -- more efficient -- that is tax efficiency, by and large, to distribute this capital back to you as our shareholders. So we -- at the Board level, we created a special committee. That special committee has been working hard and diligently. We've, again, put a target date, I think it's June 9, in which we would come back and communicate to the market the results of that special committee work. We will meet that target, and that's all I'm going to have to say on that subject today.","So those are the 4 elements of our strategy. As I said, it's focused on refocusing our business back on our core. The core is running well. It's about refocusing, making sure -- not that we ever did not have a focus on return on invested capital, by the way, but sharpening that focus and making sure you understand how we think about that focus on the returns, focusing on capital allocation. Capital allocation is something we've done, but this is the time to think about it in a different way because historically, our capital allocation was  we needed more capital to grow the business. That was a pretty easy decision, okay? But now we have choices, and we have to make sure we make those choices appropriately. And then last thing, as I said, make sure, looking forward, given how we see the business continuing to grow and the cash generation capabilities, looking forward to how we distribute that capital to you in the most efficient manner.","So that's the summary of our change in business strategy. We've been pretty busy, as you might imagine, and we're going to stay busy for a long time to come. And I think we've made outstanding progress. By the way, and I think the -- I really do want to commend the management team for a couple of things. First, they welcomed me back, which I appreciate a lot, and they've put their heads down and they're working really hard. And second is we not only did all this work, we're delivering good financial performance across the board. So it was a good year. I don't care how you cut it. It was a good year.","So a couple last topics. I do want to talk a little bit about return on invested capital because as we do all this work, we make changes, we study things, we think hard, we listen to some of you, and we've made some internal changes I think we want to share with you a little bit. And many of you often ask me when I'm out on the road, so how do we think about returns? How do we incorporate returns into compensation? Well, first is it's always been in my compensation, for those that know me, you realize I'm a rather large shareholder, and as a rather large shareholder, first and foremost, I want a return on my capital. And by the way, I invested money to get that capital. It was not stock option granted, it was my money, checks written, debt taken on and so forth. So I take the issue very seriously, always have, always will. But in addition to that, as a management tool, we have, and we started in 2011 and we've expanded some in 2012, incorporated return on invested capital into our incentive compensation programs for our senior leaders. We only deal with it at the very senior level because the way we operate the business is we control capital centrally. We think about Iron Mountain as a very distributed operating company. You think about a few people at corporate as a banker, and you have to make your case to the banker. You have to make your return case, you have to make your business case before the bank will give you any money. And we want to sweep account on your operations, so we take all your cash away from you every day. So if you want anything back, you have to come ask for it. ","So with that method of control and so forth, we control the return decisions at the central level. And some people say, \"Well, don't you want all your field managers around the world think about return on invested capital?\" No, I don't, and I'll tell you why. I don't want them thinking about it because there's a lot more business out there, and I want them to go get it. And they can't spend money the way we're structured without asking, and we know how to give them the right answers, okay. Second is I know when you run a broad geographic business spread all over the world like ours, if I incentivize somebody on return on invested capital, the easiest way to get return on invested capital is to avoid spending capital and maintaining your business, put off till next year or 5 years out when you don't care if you're in the job, maintain the business, protecting the customer assets, protecting the brand, yadi-yadi-ya. I know it. I know how I could do it. I know how they could do it. And what I want them to do is I want to see a long list of projects. I want them asking for everything. And I'm happy to weed through a long list of projects and say no to a lot rather than having them weed through it and never even showing us the stuff that, frankly, could be damn important to the business. So we think we've got it balanced right. It is, we think, an appropriate level of the company, and it's important.","So how do we calculate it? As we started to broaden that, we realized that sort of some traditional methods and some we've used even in our plan didn't work very well because when you try to visualize it and localize it, which we do want to do, we want to know what we're doing in different parts of the world and everything else, it doesn't make any sense. So we've taken an owner's earnings approach. I'm sure you can call Stephen later if you don't get this and write it down, so I won't go too slow. But the numerator is the NOPAT plus depreciation, amortization less nongrowth CapEx, okay. Nongrowth CapEx, we think, is the better indication of costs to sustain the current business than depreciation, which is the product of our prior investments and long-lived assets. And you can see nongrowth CapEx broken out in our 10-K reportings. So all the detail is out. You can do the same math we're doing, in fact. The denominator is average invested capital, and it's adjusted to align with the same methodology and calculation of the numerator. These, we believe, were the cash returns we generated on investments that were made in the business. And to give you a sense of that, in 2011, this -- our -- calculated this way, the ROIC of the company increased from 10.7 in 2010 to 11.4 in 2011. The other thing we do is everything, every investment that comes up to our so-called bank to be funded has to be viewed against a WACC plus a premium, and that premium is in line with the risk inherent with the project. And some investments are no-brainers. They're pure math. And some investments, they've got a lot of risk in them, and you got to have a different risk premium based on where it is. And it goes for geographies, it goes for a variety of other elements. So I think we've got actually quite a robust way of doing that, and I share that with you because enough  of you ask me questions when I'm on the road. I'm just making sure I'm giving everybody the same answer so that everybody understands it the way we think about it.","So before I -- let me move on to the last subject I got, and before I turn it over to Brian, let me comment on the outlook and our guidance. Hear us clearly. We think the operating performance for this year, 2012, will reflect the same business fundamentals as last year. Growth is expected in line with last year, and you should see some improved margins coming from International. The changes to recycled paper prices and even fluctuations in FX, particularly what's going on in Europe these days, will likely cloud this operating performance on a reported basis. We forecast both paper and FX off of current rates, current market rates and are transparent when we report to you both on the up and down, and they go both ways. But given the deterioration of current market rates most recently and particularly since our preliminary guidance late last year, we're updating our guidance based upon current rates. Any positive change in these rates could provide a positive upgrade. And of course, the negative change will go the other way. In this case, we believe on paper, which is the biggie here, we believe will stabilize, but I'm not guaranteeing that. And we actually do believe it's asymmetrical from a risk perspective. That is there's a better chance of it going up throughout the year than going down from it. If that happens, there will be upside to the outlook in the forecast. And again, we will not attempt to cover if there are operating performance shortfalls even on a reported basis, maybe paper can cover it. We'll make sure you see it, and we'll make sure that it's clear, what's coming from where. So with that said, let me turn over to Brian who will brief you on all the rest of the details, and then Steve will come back and take your questions.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Richard. I'll do a review today of the fourth quarter and full year 2011 performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2012. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. Our business performed well in Q4. We delivered consistent results that capped up a year of strong financial performance. We had results that were, again, supported by solid storage revenue growth and continued profit improvement in our international business. Reported revenue for Q4 was 2%, with consistent trends compared to recent quarters. Storage revenues increased 4% on a constant currency basis, supported by consistent 3% internal growth. Service revenues were flat to last year on a constant currency basis as strong gains in hybrid services and benefits from higher commodity prices were offset by continued softness in North American core service activity levels. Profit performance was in line with our expectations after adjusting for Italy. The results were, again, supported by strong gains in the International segment. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the International segment increased more than 200 basis points compared to 2010 fourth quarter and the year, and that's keeping us clearly on track to achieve our margin improvement goal of 700 basis points in improvement by the end of 2013.","Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter of $237 million included an $11 million benefit from the reclassification of our Italian business to discontinued operations. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 in Q4 and $1.31 for the full year. For the full year, we drove 4% revenue growth and continued strong free cash flow. Free cash flow was $458 million in 2011, supported by higher profits, lower interest cost and record capital spending efficiencies. Free cash flow also benefited from low cash tax payments, reflecting prepayments we made in 2010 and benefits from U.S. tax incentives in 2011. We also benefited from a high year-end capital spending accruals related to the timing of projects in the fourth quarter. These factors will normalize in 2012, which I'll speak to in more detail when we review our 2012 outlook.","As Richard noted, we achieved key milestones in 2011 as part of our 3-year strategic plan. We continue to expand our International operations while improving returns, resulting in a 25% increase in International adjusted OIBDA. We also paid out $1.1 billion against our initial $1.2 billion shareholder payout commitment and expect to complete this phase of our program with the next quarterly dividend payment in April. We're well positioned to advance our strategic plan, and we'll be providing an update in our 2012 guidance today.","Our operating outlook for 2012 hasn't changed from when we spoke to you last October. We continue to plan for 1% to 3% internal revenue growth, excluding the impact of lower paper prices, supported by sustained storage internal growth of 3%. We are revising our guidance to reflect current commodity prices. Since issuing our preliminary 2012 guidance last October, paper prices have declined an additional $50 per ton. Current paper prices are now more than 30% below average levels seen in 2011. At these levels, we project that our revenue and adjusted OIBDA will be about $45 million lower in 2012. ","Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin the review of our financial results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2010. Overall, Q4 was a good quarter, with results as expected after adjusting for Italy. Enterprise revenue growth was 2% on a constant currency basis, supported by 1% internal growth and benefits from acquisitions. Enterprise revenue gains reflect sustained storage revenue internal growth of 3% and global expansion of hybrid services. Records management storage volume increased 2% on a global basis compared to 2010 with consistent pricing trends. Year-on-year gains in recycled paper revenues and higher fuel surcharges also supported overall revenue growth. These gains offset continued pressure in North American core service activities and lower revenues from shredding another services such as fulfillment, film and sound and consulting.","From a segment perspective, North America posted [indiscernible] revenue growth, supported by consistent storage internal growth. Service revenues were down 4% in Q4 in North America. Service growth continues to be constrained by reduced retrieval and refile transportation and data protection handling activity. These impacts more than offset strong gains in hybrid revenues and benefits from higher recycled paper revenues and fuel surcharges. Our International segment posted 9% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, supported by 6% internal growth and 3 points of growth from the Polish acquisition completed in early 2011. Storage internal growth remained strong at 6%, supported by solid growth in Europe and sustained double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These gains were augmented by expansion in hybrid service revenues.","Gross profit was $427 million in Q4, yielding a gross margin of 57.5%, down 190 basis points from Q4 of last year. Included in gross profit in Q4 of 2011 is a $12 million reclassification from SG&A expenses to cost of sales to align certain costs primarily related to our scanning operations across the enterprise. Excluding this reclassification, our gross profit in the fourth quarter was in line with prior-year levels. Storage gross margins were consistent year-over-year. Service gross margins, excluding the $12 million reclassification, were down slightly primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and a shift in business mix towards the lower-margin, less capital-intensive hybrid business.","Adjusted OIBDA was $237 million or 32% of revenues. Strong performance in our International business more than offset planned increases in North America sales and marketing expense and higher incentive compensation expense compared to low levels in 2010. The reclassification of Italy to discontinued operations was also a positive factor. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $76 million and amortization was $8 million. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 per share. Reported earnings per share of $0.26 includes additional impairment charges in the Western European reporting unit, $3 million of other expense and the net impact of discrete tax items.","Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 38%, slightly lower than expected due to the reclassification of Italy. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 47% and included the impacts of the International impairment charges, foreign currency losses and adjustments to deferred taxes. ","Let's now look at -- let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange for Q4 and the full year. Our internal growth finished the year within our expected full year ranges, highlighted by solid storage internal growth of 3%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter resulted in a decrease in reported revenues of approximately 1% and reduced the positive impact of foreign currency and our full year growth rates. ","In terms of our Q4 results, overall reported revenue growth was 2%. Storage internal growth remains solid at 3%, reflecting consistent underlying trends. North America reported 2%. Internal storage growth and International storage internal growth remained strong at 6%. Net global records management volume was 2%, again, on a year-on-year basis in Q4, reflecting continued strong gains in International and modest year-on-year growth in North America. Service internal growth was minus 1%. Core service internal growth was flat in the quarter. We saw benefits from higher fuel surcharges and strong growth in hybrid services. As noted, we did see, however, continued pressure on core service activity, particularly in North America, which will offset these gains. We also saw lower revenues from other core services, such as shredding and recurring projects in Q4.  We expect that overall core service growth will remain constrained in the coming quarters.","Complementary service revenues, which represent about 12% of total revenues, decreased 5% internally in the quarter. Results reflected reduced benefits from recycled paper revenues due to lower paper prices and lower revenues from other complementary services such as fulfillment, film and sound and consulting.","Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our full year results. As noted, 2011 was a year of strong financial performance in which we achieved our financial objectives. For the full year, revenue increased 4% to $3 billion. Gross profit also increased 4% to $1.8 billion or 58.7% of revenues. Excluding the re-class from SG&A I discussed earlier, 2011 gross margins were up modestly over 2010. Adjusted OIBDA grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the $15 million of costs associated with the proxy contest. As expected, adjusted OIBDA growth has been constrained by planned investments in North America sales and marketing in 2011 and the higher levels of incentive compensation compared to low 2010 levels. Adjusted EPS was $1.31 per share, including a $0.05 impact from the $15 million of costs related to the proxy contest. Excluding these impacts, adjusted EPS was up about 6% for the year, reflecting lower interest expense and the benefit of fewer shares outstanding. 2011 capital spending was $198 million, excluding $20 million for real estate. As a percent of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate, was 6.6%, down 130 basis points from 2010 levels. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year in which we've reduced CapEx as a percentage of revenues. Free cash flow from continuing operations for 2011 was $458 million, up 24% from last year's levels. As noted, solid profit performance, including lower interest expense and improved capital efficiency, were fundamental drivers of the increase. Our cash tax payments were also low at $96 million in 2011. We benefited from prepayments made in 2010, as well as temporary U.S. tax incentives. Finally, we benefited from the timing of some of our Q4 capital expenditures resulting in an unusually high year-end accrual. This accrual will reverse in Q1 and is expected to reduce free cash flow by about $20 million in 2012.","Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows full year key metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to 2010. Consistent with our 3-year strategic plan, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segment as we build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. In 2011, our North American business segment posted 2% reported revenue growth and achieved its planned adjusted OIBDA margin goals while absorbing approximately $20 million of the incremental sales and marketing investment to sustain the revenue annuity. Adjusted OIBDA margins were effectively flat at 43% as the return of incentive compensation to more normal levels in 2011 reduced reported margins by approximately 100 basis points. ","Our International segment continues to post solid revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Our International business reported strong 7% constant dollar revenue growth in 2011, driven by 9% constant dollar storage revenue gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 25%, or 19% excluding FX impacts, keeping us on track to achieve our adjusted OIBDA margin expansion goal of 700 basis points by the end of 2013. These gains were driven primarily  by realized benefits of operational excellence initiatives in our U.K. business. We're targeting continued strong improvement of 150 to 200 basis points in International margins in 2012, supported by operational improvements in markets outside of the U.K. and profit gains in expansion markets. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects $15 million of onetime costs associated with the proxy contest. Overall, we continue to deliver strong operating performance across our business, which is driving sustained strong cash flow. This performance is supporting large shareholder payouts.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our stockholder payout program. Slide 8 shows the substantial progress we've made in returning funds to stockholders over the past 2 years. Since first announcing our plans to return cash to shareholders in February of 2010, we returned nearly $1.4 billion to stockholders comprised of $250 million of dividend payments and the repurchase of 38 million shares for more than $1.1 billion. As Richard noted, the 38 million shares represents more than 18% of the shares we had outstanding at the end of 2009.","As part of our 3-year strategic plan presented in April 2011, we committed to $2.2 billion of payouts through 2013, including $1.2 billion by May 2012. As part of this commitment, we increased our quarterly dividend again to $0.25 per share last June. As of year end, we returned more than $1.1 billion of our initial $1.2 billion commitment, and we expect to complete this phase of our program with our next quarterly dividend payout in April of this year. In Q4, we acquired 14.7 million shares for $440 million. Between January 1 and February 17, we required (sic) [acquired] an additional 1.1 million shares for $35 million. As of February 17, we had $66 million remaining on our existing $1.2 billion share repurchase  authorization. Our strong cash flow and financing capacity have us well positioned to deliver our payout commitments. ","Let's now turn to Slide 5 to review how we're managing our balance sheet to fund our business and support our payout strategy. Substantial gains and cash flow generation have enabled us to maintain a strong balance sheet. As planned, we increased our leverage by approximately \u00bd a turn  in support of our stockholder payout program. In September of 2011, we issued $400 million of 7 3\/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2019. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is 3.4x, near the midpoint of our target 3x to 4x leverage range for our company.","Our debt portfolio at December 31, 2011, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.9%, and we were 83% fixed at year end. Maturity is more than 6 years, with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At year end, liquidity was more than $800 million, with $180 million in cash and $623 million in additional borrowing capacity.","That concludes our review of the Q4 and full year 2011 results. Overall, our business continues to perform well, our financial performance was solid as expected, and we're well positioned for 2012. ","Let's now turn to Slide 10 to begin a review of our 2012 outlook. Slide 10 highlights the key factors supporting our current outlook for 2012 financial performance. As context, we reviewed our preliminary guidance for 2012 in October. At the time, we noted that paper pricing was quite dynamic and that we'd updated our outlook on the year-end call to reflect any changes. Today, we are updating our preliminary 2012 outlook to reflect current paper pricing levels. Paper prices continued to fall through the end of 2011, and at the current market levels, paper pricing is now 32% below average levels seen last year. At these levels, this will reduce 2012 revenue and OIBDA growth by $45 million or 2% and 5%, respectively. Paper pricing can fluctuate, and we've seen some improvement in market pricing early this year. We've incorporated current lower pricing levels into our full year outlook. If paper prices continue to improve, we would expect positive flow-through to our projected 2012 revenue and profits. Excluding paper price impacts, our guidance is consistent with our preliminary outlook, reflecting expectations for consistent revenue growth trends in our business. We're targeting 1% to 3% internal revenue growth x paper in 2012. We've included a schedule that breaks down our growth projections by revenue type in the appendix for this presentation. We expect to sustain storage growth of above 3%, supported by strong International gains of 5% to 6% and continued moderate growth in North America. Overall, service internal growth is expected to be relatively flat. We're planning for continued soft trends in North America core service activity, which will offset strong target growth in hybrid services. We're also targeting solid underlying gains in adjusted OIBDA, supported by  continued International margin improvement and sustained high returns in North America.","Let's turn to Slide 11 to summarize our 2012 outlook. Excluding the impact of paper prices, we're expecting revenue growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 1% to 5% on a constant currency basis. Our outlook for 2012 does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. Acquisitions added about 1% to our growth in 2011. On a reported basis, this outlook supports revenue guidance of between $2,965,000,000 and $3,045,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA of $890 million to $930 million. Included in our adjusted OIBDA outlook is about $3 million of estimated costs we expect to incur in the first half of this year related to the special committee finishing their work. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.36. Our calculation of adjusted EPS assumes a structural tax rate of 39% and 172 million shares outstanding. We're planning for relatively flat capital spending of $215 million, including about $25 million for spending for real estate. At midpoint revenue estimates, this will result in a further reduction of capital spending as a percentage of sales, consistent with our strategic planned goals. ","Our outlook is for solid free cash flow performance in the range of $320 million to $360 million. This outlook includes an estimated $20 million negative impact from the flow-over of high year-end capital accruals in 2011, as well as the estimated $45 million impact from current low recycled paper price levels. Normalizing for these factors, annual free cash flow would be in the $400 million range. Our cash forecast incorporates about $30 million of higher interest cost related to our increase in leverage to support the $1.1 billion of shareholder payouts in 2011, as well as expectations for higher cash tax payments compared to low 2011 levels. Based on our outlook for 2012, we expect our return on invested capital to be in the range of 11%. ","In summary, 2011 was a year of solid financial performance. We achieved several key milestones in our 3-year strategic plan. Our business is performing well, and we're well positioned for 2012. Thank you. We'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the 2012 OIBDA growth. I understand from your comments that you're expecting 1% to 5% constant currency growth without the effect of paper. Looking back to October, I believe you were looking for 1% to 5% constant currency growth on OIBDA for 2012, with the paper effect. Could you help bridge that for us?","Brian P. McKeon","Just normal end-of-year refinements, Andrew. I don't see that as a material change. We're just firming up the plan. And basically, on a year-over-year basis, we're seeing the benefits from the International margin improvement and some of the onetime lapping benefits being offset by the paper declines. So it's relatively consistent with where we were.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Maybe, Brian, if you could say it in a different way, we're now expecting paper prices to be a 5% drag to OIBDA. Back in October -- at the paper prices, back in October, what would have the drag been for 2012?","Brian P. McKeon","It would've been about half that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","I wondered if you could give us a sense, Brian, if I have it right, it looks like the EBITDA impact from paper is about $45 million, but the overall EBIT is only coming down $25 million. I wonder where the offset is there, number one. And then number two, the free cash flow looks like it's declining $40 million versus overall EBITDA of $25 million. Can you just help us reconcile that?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes. On the paper question, we had some of the impact baked into the preliminary guidance, so it's basically the same question Andrew just asked. We had about half of it baked in when we talked to you in October, and it came down another $50 a ton. On free cash flow, I know there's a lot of movement there. One way to think about this is if you look at 2011, we had $458 million. Normalizing that, we're really about $400 million. We had a $20 million of benefit in 2011 from year-end capital accruals, basically the timing in Q4 where the cash didn't go out the door until just after year end. And we also had some benefits from higher cash tax prepayments we made in 2010, which benefited this year. If you reduce the $450 million, you're closer to the $400 million range. When you move forward in 2012, our midpoint is $340 million. That's dampened by that $20 million capital carryover, which is more onetime, and it's also dampened by the paper impact of $45 million. So when you normalize for that, it gets up more into the $400 million range. The one thing we did try to highlight is in 2012, keep in mind, we are going to have some impacts from the higher interest levels. We borrowed money to fund the shareholder payouts, and that's about a $30 million year-on-year pretax impact, so that pulled the number down a bit.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","That's super helpful. Can you just give us the actual assumptions that foresaw the office paper pricing used in 2012 and what the average was in 2011?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes. The market pricing average in 2011 was in the $230 million range, and we're using the current paper price, which is $155 a ton. It was a little below that starting the year. It was $138. So we have a month there of -- our actual realized pricing tends to lag a bit. We contract off of indexes with suppliers that we're not dealing with the spot market, and we didn't really see the negative impact of the decline at the very end of the year, and we're starting to see that flow through in the early part of the year. So when you use that kind of drop of $75 a ton plus some of the carryover impact, that's how we get to the $45 million estimate.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Super helpful. And then if I could, just a third quick one. In terms of the REIT, I know we'll get a decision by June 9. I just want to get a sense of what the main factors are going to drive, whether we pursue that or not, number one. And then number two, how does that impact the leverage of the company overall on a go-forward basis as you think about it, if you were to pursue it and you're thinking about the capital structure as a result of that?","C. Richard Reese","Kevin, I'll try to take that. Look, I think your question is how would we think about -- I think your question is how do we think about the REIT, is that correct?","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Yes.","C. Richard Reese","All right. Look, we could spend all day on that. I'll just say a few things about it. We are at a point where we're getting close to the June 9, and I want to make sure people are not reading anything I say either way because the first thing I'm going to tell you, it's about the most complicated Rubik's cube I've ever seen, and it is one of the most intellectually interesting problems I've ever seen, by the way, too. Having said that, we're working very hard at it and -- with a positive hypothesis to see if it can be made to work or not, but you also have to understand the REIT itself is only valuable if it can be done in a way that doesn't -- as I've used sort of in a colloquial fashion, the phrase is \"Don't kill the goose that lays a golden egg.\" This is a goose with a long duration, and the value of our company is maintaining the duration. And to maintain the duration, you have to have a certain level of flexibility of how you operate and some ability to reinvest the capital to grow the business and so forth. So it's a trade of going for tax savings against balancing that, and it is overlaid with a lot of technical complexities, IRS complexities, operational and so forth and so on. So it's not like you'd go from a to b, make a decision, walk away. It's just not that easy. I wish it were because  we'd be done by now. And to be frank with you, it's consumed a lot of our time and energy and a lot of focus of a lot of senior people in the business. In terms of what the REIT would do to leverage, there's all kinds of scenarios because the next question you have to ask yourself would be if your operator is a REIT, what does it do to your strategy? Do you change your strategy? How does that change? And so forth. So it's, again, too early to make a comment on that. We would expect that before June 9 -- or maybe I'd even say before our own June 9 because I don't exactly know when we will actually get it finished. Or said another way, when we do come forth with a decision, we will try to predict an answer as many as the questions that you guys have now. Either if we say we're going to pursue being a REIT, we'll try to be very clear and precise, and if we say we're not, we'll try to do the same thing, so...","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","That's helpful. And then in terms of -- at the June 9, is it -- how long after, if you try to pursue, would you ultimately get a decision from the IRS? Is it one year or kind of 2 to 4 quarter?","C. Richard Reese","It could take up to a year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, Richard, how should we think about the lower activity levels? And is this something that is cyclically driven at this point, or do you see more secular pressure on that than you've seen in the past? And is there any prospects for that getting better, or should we just think about these much lower activity levels being the norm as we go through the next couple of years?","C. Richard Reese","All right. I think, by and large -- and this little bit varies by geography. I mean, if you go to certain parts of the world, we're having very high activity levels, okay? So I think some of you expect it. Clearly, in the health care space, which is a key component that's driving it, as I've said, that is a modality shift and a real shift that's pretty unusual, but -- yes, and that will take some years for that to roll through. In the data protection tape rotation side, again, as customers install more technology to mirror themselves, they continue to use tape as a failsafe against their infrastructure and so forth, as well as archival, but it's less activity, less active kind of pattern and so forth. So I think we're going through some, over quite a bit of time, headwind for quite a few years as some of this does reside itself. And I do think our servicing relationship to storage is going to reside itself. You notice the storage is chugging along really quite well. Customers continue to generate information, and they continue to need to keep it and maintain it regardless of how they access it. So -- but yes, we are planning and assuming we're going to see those service headwinds for quite some time.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I was intrigued by the quick commentary on the last 20 years, the move of legacy records offsite in North America, the next 15 or 20 you said, same thing happening in some of these more growthy markets. Is there any evidence, or are you at all fearful that how this trend happens in some of the growth  your emerging markets will be different, meaning that they'll maybe use more technology and less physical documents given that that technology is available today as those economies and industry in those economies grows? Or do you think the roadmap is going to look pretty darn similar to what you've seen in the last 20 years...","C. Richard Reese","I think it's going to look pretty darn similar for a couple of reasons. One is a lot of the records that you generate and you bring up our legacy, they've already been  created, okay? They've just got to get assembled and moved and organized and so forth and so on. Places like Latin America is growing like a weed both on storage and activity and payments, and they're very technology savvy. We do more technology services in Latin America, more complex things for our customers than we do anywhere else, too. So there's a higher adoption rate of everything. And I think, look, what really happens is when you got great growing economies, you get it all happening, okay? And so it's pretty simplistic stuff to think about. Go where the world is going to be growing, and there's going to be a lot of information created, thrown out, need to be managed, need to be secured. And just like in North America, the real trend that you got to keep in mind is information was junk 25 or 30 years ago that people kept, just like you probably have an attic full or basement full, at least I do, of stuff that you keep because you won't throw it away, information. When I joined the business, that's the way it was looked at by everybody except pretty much financial services, okay? People didn't know why they kept it. They just kept it. And it has shifted to being a scenario where information is an asset. That means the way you think about its security, its chain of custody, its processing, who sees it, yadi-yadi-yada, go up. It has to be managed. It has to be maintained. That's going to happen in the rest of the world. That trend, I know, is absolutely happening already. And yes, there'll be plenty more technology moving around. The net of that -- the issue of plenty more technology moving around is some of our hybrid businesses in some of these emerging markets are booming faster than they are in our mature markets. And as I said, we do more complex work with more part of the chain of process of the business than everything else. So in a lot of respects, it makes it stickier, too.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up. Brian, I think you made a comment that average OIBDA had an $11 million benefit for moving Italy to discontinued. Can you just run through the math of that or maybe correct me if I heard that wrong?","Brian P. McKeon","No, you didn't. It was -- in 2011, there was a few pieces. We have small operating losses in Italy. We had restructuring charges that were related to the overall International improvement plan, and we also had some costs related to the fire that we disclosed and talked about. So the combination of those 3 in terms of the profit results in 2011, moving them to discontinued operations was about $11 million of losses. That's not the run rate of the business. I think going forward, we're targeting basically flattish kind of profit in 2012, so there wasn't a benefit going forward. But there was a fair bit of losses that we're incurring this year.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's for the full year. What was the number for the fourth quarter?","Brian P. McKeon","I don't have that right in front of me, but a fair amount of those costs were in the fourth quarter. We can follow up on that for you.","C. Richard Reese","Operator, we're going to take one more call. I have historically tried to promise to keep this to one hour, and I'm already 5 minutes over. And it's my fault because I talked 30 minutes of it. So I apologize now. Plus we look at the queue of who's calling, and we're going to be on the phone with everyone of you throughout the rest of the day, so we'll make sure we catch your calls. But we'll take one more call for the group. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The -- I wanted to dig a little bit more into the previous question and just look at the service trends. I guess outside of health care, we're already seeing some of the structural changes in that industry. What are maybe the next couple of industries that make up a bigger portion of the service revenue? And are you seeing secular challenges there as well?","C. Richard Reese","Financial services is a big player. I think financial services, to be candid with you, it's a different trend. Financial services, early adopter technology. They adopted technology years and years ago of all types, and -- but they're also major creators of information, including paper. The big trend in financial services is they, over the last 5, at least 5 to 7 years, have really gone about organizing their physical programs, making sure they know what they have and getting rid of what they can get rid of. And as you know, they've gone through various cycles of litigation cycles, some of which they're still in. And when they get in these litigation cycles, they basically continue to accumulate documents but don't throw much away. And then if they get a little breathing point between lawsuits and so forth and if the program is organized correctly, and they have to be in most cases, they'll do sort of catch-up destructions. And so financial services, what you've seen over the last few years is a dampening of growth on the storage side related to that trend. It'll build up, and then they'll do a lot of \"Let's get rid of it,\" big destruction process. You also, by the way, see that after we talk about they rightsize their program, they get themselves caught up, then they grow along very nicely off of a lower base and so forth. And so when you deal with as much of them as we do, every year, you get big activities like that. So that's the big trend in financial services. They have been relatively inactive for a long time because they, as I've said, are the  extreme early adopters of technology on this front. The health care is just -- in a lot of respects, it's just very unique. You know maybe more than I do about health care, but you know that a lot of money -- the Obama health care plan, the headline was $44 billion. I've been told it's going to be $80 billion, give or take. They're going to try to get every health organization to be computerized as carrots and sticks. It's going be interesting to watch it happen, but that's a lot of money to spend, and that's not even -- that's not being spent to reduce the storage or an activity bill. I wish we did have a percentage of that in the business. But we will see the fallout as they totally change their workflow. Not to 0, but it's going to rightsize. There's no doubt in my mind. And by the way, we are in a case where the comedown will be faster than the rise up. There's good opportunity for us in health care, and the best thing, to give you example, is the record type in health care that's dropped the fastest and continues and will drop the fastest, as I said, is physical x-rays. Because that is a case of real technology switch-out where they don't make them anymore, by and large. They do it on CAT scans, MRIs and other things. And that's why we, a few years ago, started a Digital business, digital record center for medical images. And when we sold our Digital business, we did not sell that product line. We announced a partnership not too long ago with NetApp, where we are their cloud back-end in that space. Like all annuity businesses that you do from scratch, it will start very slowly, but if you roll out over quite a bit of time, and that's the patience level that I understand that many of you don't have, but I've seen this movie many times, that will be a very nice business. And that's just going -- it'll be bigger than the x-ray business we have today. It will be more profitable than the x-ray business we have today, okay? But we're going to go through the troughs. When one comes down and the another one rises, the comedown rate is a lot faster than the rise rate. And it's just -- that's a fact of life.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to put some context around this, so I think, Richard, in the past, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said that health care represents, I don't know, something like 10% of your total revenues, but it's disproportionately service-based to your prior comments.","C. Richard Reese","Well, the total health care is bigger, a bit bigger, but the highly active piece is smaller. Yes, it's like in the 5 or less of the storage kind of business.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","As a percentage of service, though, what percentage does health care represents in 2011?","Brian P. McKeon","All services for records management, it's probably more in the 20% range, a higher percentage because of the more active nature of some of it. And as part of the overall business, it's somewhat smaller because we don't have the same kind of development, in areas like data protection or also outside of the U.S. So that's a U.S. kind of reference.","C. Richard Reese","Yes. And the other thing I would stress to you, look, anything can change, but we dug pretty deep and looked at individual customer behavior. And what we do tend to see is an adoption curve where a customer will adopt, and their pattern will rapidly decline, and then it'll settle to a new level and then it goes on, all right? And then of course, what happens is every month or whatever, new customers are hitting that adoption cycle. And yes, we probably could do a better job. We just haven't slowed  down and think about it, try to precisely guess how many years out this will run. But it will run quite a few years. It's a little bit every year. I mean, there's a low probability this will just -- we'll wake up one day and it'll drop like a rock. I think it'll just keep doing this for a while, unfortunately -- unfortunately, whichever way you look at it. I'm happy to keep it for a long time. We make money at it. On the other hand, we'll be whining about it for some years.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And if you could, I just want to get a little bit better sense of the International growth rates, clearly, a big driver of the business here. And Richard, you kind of talked about the denominator effect in North America. I'm trying to understand a little bit better the denominator effect of your International markets. Clearly, there's some very mature and some very growthy markets today. If you could separate how much of your International business would be kind of in that mature or slower growth rate versus the faster growth markets, just so we can get a sense of kind of where you are on this long trend line.","C. Richard Reese","Yes. We're scrambling for a document which will tell us that. You actually can find that on our website. If you looked at our April strategy presentation, we broke all that out, and somebody's going to point to me. All right, Stephen, interpret these numbers for me quickly.","Stephen P. Golden","About half.","C. Richard Reese","It's about half in what we call material leadership markets, which have a little better growth rate than North America, and about half in emerging markets, okay?","Brian P. McKeon","It's a little bit higher if you throw in...","C. Richard Reese","No, excuse me. Yes, leadership.","Brian P. McKeon","These numbers throw in -- take basically U.K. and Western Europe, it's probably 60% or more, which looks a lot like the U.S. in terms of the growth profile.","C. Richard Reese","So as I said, we've run over, which we try not to do, but it's my long-windedness, which I apologize for. It was a good year of financial performance, as I said, and a good year of change. And I think the organization has adapted to the change very well, which we appreciate a lot. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. We are -- this is REIT, no REIT capital allocation work that's ongoing, I'll be candid with you now. We've set a date. It's such a complex Rubik's cube. It is a difficult issue. As you turn over rocks, you find more worms. You turn over more rocks, you find more worms. But we're working it really hard. We're going to make the deadline one way or the other, but we are focused hard on it. And we appreciate your support, and we look forward to seeing you guys as we're out on the road, and many of you, we'll talk to the rest of the day. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Tasha [ph], and welcome everyone to our Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and our progress towards strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and discuss portions of our supplemental reporting package. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2014 and 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William L. Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, with progress over -- on our 3-year strategic plan and other important initiatives.","During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our performance in the developed markets, further expanded the portion of our business from faster-growing emerging markets, increased the momentum in our emerging business segment and accelerated our real estate purchase program.","We also declared our first regular quarterly dividend as a REIT in the remainder of our EMP distribution, resulting in a substantial payout to stockholders.","Our financial results for the quarter continued to reflect some noise related to our REIT conversion. I'll touch on the highlights, and Rod will address the specifics in a few minutes.","Total revenue for the quarter was $783 million, up 3.9% on a constant dollar basis, in line with our 3-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth.","Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS were both impacted by restructuring charges as well as ongoing REIT compliance costs, which were not in last year's numbers.","Turning to the operating highlights. Total storage rental revenue, a key economic driver of our business, was up 5.6% in constant dollars, driven by strong growth of 12.5% in our international business, 3.3% in North American Records and Information Management and 1.9% growth in Data Management.","Strong storage rental growth in the third quarter reflects our focus on driving net positive storage rental volume growth in developed markets. Year-to-date, we added 3.7 million cubic feet, net of acquisitions, or 0.8% volume growth. Of this amount, North America alone was positive 1.6 million cubic feet.","We also continued to improve retention with further reductions in customer terminations and permanent withdrawals in North America, bringing total volume outflows down to 6.3% from 6.6% in the second quarter. The combination of improved customer retention, together with internal and new sales, has yielded North America the positive internal volume growth of 1.6 million cubic feet referenced above. These trends underscore the durability of our high-return business in the mature, developed markets, which remain fragmented with significant unvended potential, and the success of our targeted sales and customer retention initiatives.","Turning to emerging market performance. As of the end of the third quarter, we now have 12.2% of total revenue coming from these high-growth markets, up from 10.5% at the beginning of the year, progressing nicely towards our goal of 16% by the end of 2016. Emerging market internal storage rental growth -- revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter, driven by internal volume growth of 9%. Including acquisition gains, volume growth was 19% in the emerging markets.","Acquisitions continued to be an integral part of our strategy with particular emphasis on high-growth emerging markets. Since our last quarterly report, we closed on the acquisition of Keepers Brazil, our fourth acquisition there in the last 2 years. Brazil's record management market is expected to continue to grow in the high single digits annually for the next 3 to 5 years, and we are achieving steady improvement in profits and returns as we continue to enhance our leadership position.","We also anticipate further enhancement as we shift operations to our new campus in Hortol\u00e2ndia, near S\u00e3o Paulo, over the next few years.","Additionally, in Eastern Europe, we bought out the vast majority of our JV partners' interest in Serbia, Denmark, Russia and the Ukraine, and we acquired ALCZ, a provider of records management services in the Czech Republic, increasing the size of our business there by some 15%.","We have a strong pipeline of opportunities in emerging markets with more than 4x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of having at least 16% of our sales from emerging markets by 2016. We continue to evaluate acquisitions in terms of how they can both further our market leadership and sustain the durability of our business, after first establishing that we can exceed our cost to capital and achieve our targeted returns.","Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to experience good momentum in our data center operations. We will invest roughly $27 million this year to expand capacity by 25%, and deliver the space related to bookings in our Pennsylvania underground facility, where more than 90% of the inventory space is contracted.","We also signed our first few deals in the initial phase of our new aboveground facility in Boston, and have a pipeline of about 3x our initial capacity. Our year-to-date investment in this business is about $19 million, and we plan to invest another $16 million or so in the fourth quarter to accommodate capacity requirements in the underground facility. As we've noted in the past, we will invest in our data center business based on customer wins.","Another strategic goal as a REIT is our plan to own more of our real estate over time and continue to optimize our portfolio. Since the beginning of the year, we've bought in or have under contract more than 700,000 square feet of space, including properties in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Virginia as well as one building in Cork, Ireland. Our primary focus, however, will be on U.S. properties, where we have a total of 22.5 million square feet of purchase opportunity.","Moreover, through purchase options, we have a clear path towards ownership of an additional 3.4 million square feet. Execution of these options would shift our own percentage by about 5 points, implying that together with the recent purchases, our owned or controlled portfolio of real estate represents approximately 40% of our total. Expected unlevered IRRs, or internal rates of return, on properties purchased to date are between 9% and 12%.","It's important to note that we also have a substantial portion of our properties covered by attractive lease rates, given the long-term nature of those lease arrangements, so those will generally not be part of early purchase consideration. We also disposed of some older properties and will continue to prune the portfolio to maximize the value of our real estate holdings.","In other REIT-related developments, we declared both our first regular quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share and a special distribution of $3.62 per share, representing the remainder of the EMP purge to be distributed 80% in stock and up to 20% in cash.","As you may know, the 3-day pricing period for the special distribution ended last night, resulting in an average price of $35.55 per share. As a result, we expect to issue approximately 15.7 million shares, bringing our total outstanding to 209 million shares. Our quarterly dividend rate was based on an assumption of 209 million shares outstanding following the stock dividend.","Subject to board approval, we expect to declare and pay another regular quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share in December. We also expect to declare and pay a catch-up dividend, which will represent the remainder of the total $400 million of ordinary dividends to be distributed in 2014. We don't yet know that precise per share rate, but we expect to outline the remaining 2014 payments later in November.","These dividend payments are significant as they represent the culmination of our conversion to a REIT and demonstrate our commitment to enhancing stockholder returns through attractive payouts and steady long-term cash flow growth.","At our current payout rate, in yesterday's share price, our dividend represents a 5.3% yield, well in excess of most REITs, and supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in excess of the 8% to 9% TSR, or total shareholder return, of the S&P 500.","Combining our current yield of 5.3% with our expected adjusted OIBDA growth of approximately 4% results in a TSR for Iron Mountain of over 9% prior to dividend reinvestment and also before we add potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities.","Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. After maintenance and IT-related CapEx and the dividend, we retained enough cash to support investment associated with internal growth in our core business. As we become more active with acquisitions and the purchase of real estate, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing or equity issuance, similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth.","As we've said from the beginning of the process, our business is well-suited to the REIT structure due to our sizable real estate portfolio and our attractive business model, through which we incur occupancy costs on a square-foot basis but generate storage rental revenue on a cubic foot basis. This significant spread between our costs and our return on investment generates high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders.","We also distinguish ourselves through low-maintenance CapEx and low turnover costs per square foot. We have no TIs, or tenant improvements, required if a customer terminates, and we bring in another customer's records. We also have a low customer churn of less than 2% per annum, as well as excellent customer credit quality, given our service to 950 of the Fortune 1000.","Due to the 15-year average life of a box in our storage facilities, we also have very low volatility in the growth of our storage rental business even during turbulent economic cycles.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.","Roderick Day","Thanks, Bill. We continue to be pleased with our operating performance. We had a solid third quarter, anchored by storage rental and improving volume growth as well as benefits from acquisitions in emerging and developed markets.","I will begin today with an overview of our third quarter financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year, and a preliminary outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics.","As a reminder, we now provide all of our financial disclosures and the earnings commentary in one comprehensive supplemental reporting package. I will be referring to certain pages of this package throughout my remarks.","Turning to our financial results for the quarter. Let me direct you to financial highlights on Page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $783 million for the quarter, up approximately 4% compared with $755 million in 2013. Adjusted OIBDA declined by approximately 2%, reflecting ongoing REIT compliance costs as well as acquisition-related costs when compared to prior year. Year-to-date adjusted OIBDA increased by 1%, which includes $3.5 million of costs associated with our 2013 restructuring and approximately $8 million of REIT compliance costs. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for the first 9 months of 2013 included $5 million in restructuring charges.","Adjusted EPS of $0.35 is consistent with our annual guidance. For the quarter, it would have been $0.40 prior to a $0.02 impact from ongoing REIT compliance costs and $0.03 impact from depreciation and amortization related to REIT CapEx and investments.","Additionally, EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Similarly, our structural tax rate for year-to-date 2014 came out to 16%. We continue to believe our tax rate will be roughly in the same range over the long term.","On a GAAP basis, net income was impacted by approximately $40 million tax provision, which represents the revisions or estimates made in the second quarter for the reversal of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the REIT conversion and taxes related to foreign repatriation.","Also highlighted on this page are investment and capital expenditures. Year-to-date maintenance CapEx of roughly $45 million is on a run rate to be below our $80 million to $100 million full year guidance range. However, we typically see the majority of capital improvement projects undertaken in the latter portion of the year.","Other CapEx of $33 million is roughly in line with the $50 million midpoint of our full year guidance, and real estate investment of $145 million, which includes racking, is on track with our full year expectation of around $200 million.","As Bill noted, we are accelerating our efforts to own more of our real estate over time, and you can track the changes to our global real estate portfolio on Page 19. Over the long term, we believe that the purchase of our real estate will create value for our shareholders.","The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On Page 9, looking at the top line growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis, revenue is up 3.9%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5.6% and service revenue growth of 1.3%. The growth in service revenue was driven by recent acquisitions and increases in imaging projects. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date total revenue growth was 4.3%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5.5% and service revenue growth of 2.6%.","Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvement in net volume growth in Records Management with total year-on-year volume growth in the quarter of 5.5% including acquisitions, or 1.8% excluding acquisitions.","Volume trends remain consistent with prior quarters, demonstrating stable incoming volume from existing customers, important additional contributions from acquisitions and further improvements in the level of terminations and withdrawals.","Let's turn to Page 11, where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q3 segment results were generally in line with our expectations, as our storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and adjusted OIBDA expansion of 160 basis points to 39.5%.","North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.4%. However, the decline in service revenues in the DM business drove adjusted OIBDA margins for this segment down for the quarter. That said, DM remains a high-margin business of 56.2%. Declines in service revenues continue to reflect the trends towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as our customers rotate their tapes less frequently and the biggest business becomes more archival.","The International segment continued to generate attractive results with 6.8% storage rental internal growth. Internal service revenue growth for this segment declined by approximately 1.5%, primarily due to the reduction in nonrecurring customer projects. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s targets, with adjusted OIBDA margins of 24.5% year-to-date.","Finally, Corporate and Other revenue was up about 10%, reflecting growth in data-centric service revenues. As Bill noted, we are making good progress, and we expect to end the year near a $20 million revenue run rate.","Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2014 and preliminary guidance for 2015, on Page 10. Our business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent, and we are on track to achieve our financial goals for 2014. Therefore, we are maintaining the majority of our 2014 guidance whilst tightening some of our ranges.","That said, we have made 2 changes to our guidance that impact earnings per share. The first relates to the partial year impact of new shares that will be issued as a result of the special distribution. This will obviously impact our per-share metrics. The second relates to foreign exchange pressures. For the first half of the year, modest pressures from FX were offset by contribution from acquisitions and consistent core performance, which allowed us to remain comfortable within our previous ranges. However, as we have progressed through the year, we have witnessed further material strengthening of the dollar, which is outweighing the benefit from acquisitions and consistent performance. In the light of these recent changes, it is prudent to adjust for the known currency impact at this time.","So as a result of the stock distribution and the impact of the foreign currency exchange rates, we have reduced adjusted EPS guidance for 2014 to $1.33 to $1.44 from our current range of $1.37 to $1.52. In addition, normalized FFO per share will be reduced to $2.21 to $2.46 from the current range of $2.25 to $2.51.","Moving on to our preliminary guidance for 2015. From an operational standpoint, we believe we are on track to deliver our long-term goals, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 2% to 5%, in line with our strategic plan. Please note these growth ranges are in constant dollars based on our 2014 budget constant dollar rates.","If the dollar remains strong, the current estimated impact on revenue and contribution could be at 100 to 150 basis points. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.38 for 2015. To be clear, this guidance reflects an anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars, offset on a per-share basis by the impact of the additional 15.8 million shares issued in connection with the special distribution.","Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $440 million and $480 million, with AFFO between $570 million and $610 million.","And, in addition, we anticipate that our dividend growth will continue to be in line with contribution growth. From a CapEx standpoint, we expect to maintain level spend on maintenance CapEx and acquisitions, although we anticipate an uptick in real estate investment driven by our purchase plan. We will update our outlook again on our Q4 earnings call to reflect changes, if any, including the impact of FX.","Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 25 and 26 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of about $1.2 million. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.2x has increased over the past 3 years, as planned, to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%.","We continue to shift our debt financing to international markets. In addition to having our expenses denominated in local currencies, we have long-dated bonds in Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, euro and more currencies available under our credit facility. This provides a natural foreign exchange hedge to support our growth in international markets and reduce taxable income in local jurisdictions.","In September, we issued the equivalent of about GBP 400 million in a private pounds sterling fed offering in the U.K., and established a line of credit in Brazil to support our growth.","Turning now to REIT-specific metrics on Page 20. We have provided storage NOI per racked square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate for both our RM and DP businesses. We continue to achieve storage NOI in excess of $21 per square foot, amongst the highest in the REIT sector.","On Page 21, our racking and building utilization rates remain high and in line with prior quarter at 91% and 83%, respectively. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time.","On Page 28, we have provided components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area.","Finally, we are currently showing investment in buildings, racking and acquisition at book value, but it's our intent ultimately to provide a schedule of these investment categories with our expected returns. As we have stated in the past, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting, and we welcome your feedback.","So, in summary, Q3 was a solid quarter, consistent with prior performance and supported by a sustained storage rental performance, stable profitability on our North American segments and strong international and emerging market performance.","I will now hand the call back to Bill.","William L. Meaney","Thanks, Rod. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to sum up by saying that despite some noise this quarter due to one-offs and aligning ourselves as a REIT, we are in line with our expectations and consistent with the strategic plan we laid out at Investor Day. The fundamentals are important, and we're pleased with the positive momentum we're seeing in the business. More specifically, we are driving volume in storage rental across both developed and emerging markets, we're shifting our revenue mix to faster growing emerging markets, and we're executing on attractive acquisitions and focusing on building scale, particularly given the highly fragmented nature of the markets we operate in.","Our momentum leading into 2015 is strong. Our storage rental revenue internal growth accelerated to 2.2% in the third quarter, having started the year in the first quarter at 1.4%. In addition to continue strong internal volume growth in our Emerging Markets of 9%, we added 3.7 million cubic feet of internal growth in our developed markets as well, and added 1.6 million cubic feet in North America alone.","In our emerging business area, we expanded capacity in the data center business by 25%, and more than 90% of the inventory space is contracted. And we've added another 700,000 square feet to our owned real estate portfolio at unlevered returns between 9% and 12%.","2015 preliminary guidance calls for similar growth in operating performance and adjusted OIBDA, although we anticipate some reported revenue headwinds due to the continued strengthening of the dollar. We expect consistent trends for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets, and are on track to continue to make emerging markets a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. And we continue to identify and incubate new business opportunities that are complementary to our core business.","We believe the culmination of these key drivers in steady growth in earnings and AFFO, consistent with our [indiscernible] day projections and related growth in our dividend.","With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to dive into the acceleration of the internal storage revenue growth. Obviously, it was very encouraging, but the service revenue was down more. And my question is, aren't these 2 sort of tied, like fewer destructions means less service revenues, which helps accelerate internal storage? And of course, storage is a better business. And so when you put that all together, I see you're looking for 1% to 2% internal for 2015. I assume you think that service will be kind of stable or positive to get there. So just help me with the confluence between service and storage internal revenue growth in the quarter and how it frames your 2015 comments.","William L. Meaney","So let me start, Andrew, and then I'll let Rod chime in on it. I mean, first of all, the thing you're highlighting is part of the story, but I think it's only part of the story. I think if you actually look at our service revenue, is in the data management space or our tape business, that's where we've seen more of an acceleration or a continued increase in terms of the drop in service revenue. It's starting to slow down, but that's the area which probably started a little bit after the drop in service revenue in our box business, but is still continuing, whereas in the box business, we do see more stability. Some of it is a reduction in destructions because there is some -- as we said last time on the call, there's some choppiness in terms of the way legal holds come in and out in terms of when things are queued up for destruction. But also, a part of the story is the data management business. So we feel good where we're guiding in terms of the overall growth in storage rental, and I think we said at the beginning of the year, we expected to get back into the 2s, and we've achieved that. So we feel like we're set up for good momentum next year, but I think it is important to call out that in our data management business, we continue to see a decline in service as that business becomes more and more archival. And then Rod, if you want to add anything?","Roderick Day","Yes. I mean, Andrew, obviously, there's a small sort of relationship between lower destructions and then impacting service revenues. So we're not hiding from that, but it's not really what's explaining what's going on in service. And just on that particular point, clearly, we'd rather have the queues given the sort of the perpetuity value of them than take the destruction revenue. So in terms of long-term value for the business, it's clearly a trade-off that we'd want to make. In terms of looking to 2015 and sort of answering that part of your question, what we're expecting within the numbers, certainly, we expect to sort of maintain the improved and good performance I think we're now seeing on the storage side. We're not expecting a sort of radical turnaround in service by any means, but we would expect to see some more modest improvements, particularly in areas such as our imaging business, which is actually showing reasonable progress this year at reasonable margins as well. So areas like that we're looking into to see what we can do to continue to drive performance. So hopefully that answers your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On the service question. I'm curious about the special projects. Could you talk about what you're seeing, ebbs and flows there, and what your outlook is going forward for how meaningful those will be?","William L. Meaney","I think that -- Scott, I think, these are -- they are large, specific projects. Sometimes they are consulting projects, when we are bringing a new customers in, there's a number of things that they want to look at in terms of cleaning up some of their processes or digitizing parts of their inventory. So it's everything from bringing in new customers and some of the costs associated with that from their standpoint, to one-off projects again, where customers are going through a major cleanup or digitization of some of their records. So it's one of those areas which is probably the more difficult to guide for, because it's something that is usually driven by customer relationships and specific asks on their part. So it is something that we market for, but it's something that is hard to predict.","Roderick Day","And I think that's right, and actually, it can be a little bit lumpy. I mean, our business is obviously pretty predicable when compared to most businesses. But in Q3 last year, we actually had quite a large project in the data management space that kind of impacted some of our comparables. But they can be profitable lines of activity for us, so we'd expect to continue doing them, but they can sort of jump around a little bit quarter to quarter.","William L. Meaney","And the only thing I would add to that is we expect that and it is -- you can think of it as also a -- it's a marketing expense that has a very nice profit associated with it in terms of either maintaining a strong customer relationship as a way we differentiate ourselves with our customers, or, as I said earlier, in terms of getting a customer in, but it is also an area where we're able to variabilize our cost base. So it's something that we can preserve the margins, even though you have this lumpiness, but it's very much part of why we -- our revenue is so sticky, because we're able to provide these additional services to our customers when they need it.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division",".","Now I may have missed this. Did you indicate your expectation within guidance for paper prices in 2015?","Roderick Day","I didn't actually say anything on that, but our expectation would be for it to be flat year-over-year.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then could you address swing factors with regard to high end, low end of guidance range for 2015? I imagine that the sizable acquisition pipeline will contribute there, but -- to the high end or the low end. But could you talk to some other drivers you think that will be meaningful in swinging the variance?","Roderick Day","Well, certainly, as you say, acquisitions, both in terms of the rate at which we bring on businesses and the speed at which we're able to integrate them have an impact. And for sure -- and as we look to next year, FX is going to be an issue. We've seen, as I was saying in the remarks earlier, that the dollar has strengthened, particularly over the last month or so. Clearly, that could get stronger, it could get weaker, and so we're studying that closely, and we'd look to update guidance at the beginning of next year as regards to FX, but that is an issue just given the sort of the global nature of our business. And you mentioned the shreds paper price, that's always a volatility that we have to manage. And another one within that for us will be our DMS scanning business, which has a sort of project component to it. To sort of build on the conversation we were talking about earlier, is that we are making reasonable progress actually in that area at the moment, and we -- obviously, we hope to continue to do so. But that's another item that can move.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just one final one for me. Are you content with the size of the sales force you have, where they're focused, where they're located? Any major internal initiatives on that front into 2015?","William L. Meaney","I think we are -- I think on that point is that where our investment on the sales force is less on organization and reorg. We think the reorganization we did last year to get them much more in tune and closer to the market. Because as I said in my remarks, our market is still very fragmented, so we wanted to make sure that we were aligning the sales force with those real opportunities and unvended opportunities are. I think our focus this year now is less on the reorganization, because we think we've got that right, but more on the training in performance management of the sales force. So that's really the focus, and so we think we've got the right numbers, we've got them in the right places, and now it's about equipping them from a training in performance management standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Going deeper into the storage business, can you map out how you expect volume and pricing trends to play out in your various geographies and what implications that will mean for future internal storage growth trends?","William L. Meaney","I think that the -- let me kind of back up and just highlight kind of the journey that we're on. So if you look at, say, a year ago, pretty much all of '13, you would see if we net out acquisitions, then you would have about 1.1% growth rate in terms of net incoming volume on the storage business, or on the box business, right? And if you look at where -- if you look at '14, I mean -- yes, '14, during that same period, you'll see that we've trended up from 1.5% net volume internal growth rate to this latest quarter of 1.8%. So, if you think about it, we've added 70 bps over the course of the year in terms of our internal growth rate. So if you're seeing -- and then at the same time, you see what we've done on the revenue side, as we said, we started off at 1.4% in terms of storage internal growth rate, in terms of revenue, and we're up to 2.2%. What we see going forward is, and it kind of relates to the last question from Scott in terms of what we're doing with our sales force, is we really do think now that we've got the sales force organized in the right buckets and looking at the right opportunities is -- and now we're spending -- investing a lot more money and time in terms of the training in performance management of that sales force. So, what we would see is that continued trend going forward. We do think that, from a pricing standpoint, as we start going into some of the unvended areas, we would expect that we could continue the type of performance that we've got in the latest quarter. So that's -- and that's really what we're focused on right now, and we're seeing that. And when you ask about geographies, the big part of that growth, that 70 basis points of growth that I've highlighted in terms of across our business, has been mainly -- the improvements mainly come out of -- or the deltas come out of the developed market. So a lot of this realignment of the sales force has been focused at the developed market, which is far from being dead, because I said it's still -- we find the developed markets, when we really got into it, is much more fragmented and much more unvended than we previously suspected. So we would expect to be able to continue the kind of performance that we saw in the third quarter going forward into '15."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Very helpful, Bill. And then on the services side, can you provide some additional color on the rate at which services trends are stabilizing? Any positive or negative catalyst that can move the needle with services?","William L. Meaney","Let me just stay high level. I'm going to let Rod comment in a little bit more in detail. I think that it's a tale of 2 -- let's take 3 different components of looking at the services. The one part on the box side of the business, which I think we've been calling out for the last couple of quarters, we see a flattening out of that. In other words, that business is becoming more archival, but we see kind of a stabilization in terms of the service rates that we're getting in that business, and we've been very successful in terms of stripping out costs as that business is becoming more archival. So we've got a good match between our costs and our activities in the box business, and we see a flattening out of that decline. If we look in the data management business, is we see continued single-digit decline, but significant single-digit decline in that business over time, then we're able to reduce costs in line with that. But we think that, if we look at it, we think the data management business, or the tape business, is a little bit behind in the life cycle in terms of trending towards the archival side of the business. So I think we're in the earlier part of the game, if you will, in terms of that flattening out. So I wouldn't call that as a flattening-out trend yet, but we're able to manage it from a margin standpoint. And then the third bucket is really some of the things that we were referring to before, is the DMS or, in some places we call it BPM-type processes, and there, there's 2 parts of it. There is what I would call the ones that are much more long-contracted, embedded part of the process with our customers, and these are multiyear contracts, where it's kind of an ongoing trend. And then we have some of these large projects, which are usually associated with a change or a specific need for the customers. But I don't know, Rod, if you want to comment in more detail?","Roderick Day","I don't know, I think you've hit on the sort of the key dynamics that we see. I suppose that the other point I would make is within services, where we have the shredding business as well, which is performing this year. But as I was saying earlier, the importance of paper price can sort of swing that up or down. It's actually been pretty stable this year. But I think in terms of the sort of the fundamental dynamics of -- and the bottoming out, some signs of bottoming out within RM, less so within DM. I think probably, the only other thing I'd add is then, obviously what we do try to do is make sure we're managing costs very tightly against whatever revenues that we have. I think it's been said on a number of occasions, it's the storage part of our business is where most of the value comes from. Services is an important contributor, but less material in terms of overall value. So the challenge for us is as these trends sort of work their way out, we need to -- and have been continuing to sort of make sure our costs are mapped accordingly."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Very helpful. And then just from a margin perspective, we had some impact this quarter from REIT compliance costs and acquisition-related costs. Just looking ahead, how do you expect these costs to evolve? And what kinds of sources of margin expansion can help mitigate these incremental costs?","Roderick Day","Well, certainly, the REIT costs that we now include in our adjusted OIBDA, are those that -- essentially, those costs are the need to allow us to sustain the REIT structure going forward. So, if you think -- we're effectively incurring them this year, we would expect to incur them again next year. So from a year-on-year dynamic, this year is kind of a negative because we didn't have them last year. Next year, it will be neutral from a year-on-year perspective. I think in terms of acquisitions, it will depend obviously on the -- what the future acquisition program is and how it plays out. The way that we work our acquisitions today is that in the first year, there's typically a significant amount of integration expense as we look to make sure we drive the synergies out of the businesses that we get. And then from year 2, the benefits really start to flow through. So, from the acquisitions that we've made so far, clearly, there will be a benefit year-on-year as we go '15 to '14. I think in terms of what does that mean fully in '15, it will depend on when we do any more acquisitions going forward, and the sort of the level of them. We're expecting that our acquisition program will be similar in scale, but clearly, it's always hard to predict exactly what we'll be able to close.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Let me just -- following up on that margin question, and I apologize if some of this -- I did hear was in the prepared remarks. But on the international margin decline, what -- I mean, that was down 290 basis points. I assume some of that was these M&A costs. But can you maybe give us that number in the magnitude just to kind of help us think about what's going on there?","Roderick Day","Well, I think what we do on the international side is we really try to manage it so over the course of the year, we're around the 25% mark. So year-to-date, I think we're at 24.5%. I think in the quarter itself, it was below that. Certainly, that number is the one that tends to get impacted more by phasing of acquisition -- the acquisition integration spend because that's where a significant amount of our acquisitions have been. So it can sort of jump around a bit depending on whether we're investing to get synergies or the synergies are coming out. But overall, I think we're quite happy where we're at, tracking to the sort of mid-20s margin, and that's pretty much where we are year-to-date.","William L. Meaney","Yes, the only thing I'd add to it. You -- just reiterating or emphasizing what Rod is saying is we wouldn't change -- we've said that -- we had that program to target the improvement to get up to 25% or mid-20% margins in the international portfolio, we wouldn't move off of that. You will get noise from time to time because of the timing of certain acquisitions and integration costs associated with that, but we feel pretty good about the portfolio as it is today that the maturing of some and adding of others that we think that mid-20s in terms of margin target is where we'll maintain.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. I guess, my second question is kind of a 2-part, I guess, around M&A. I mean, the first part, just mechanically, how much M&A revenue is assumed in the 2015 guidance? And I guess, the capital that you're planning in the guidance to spend, do you have revenue and OIBDA attached to that in the guidance? Or would that be incremental? That's the first part. And then I guess, the second part of the question would be, given the leverage and the capital needs that you have, is there anything that would prohibit you from doing larger acquisitions if they came to the market maybe through an equity issuance? And how do you think about your cost to capital here as ability to do that?","Roderick Day","Maybe just to answer the first point, if you look at what we've done, the year-on-year benefit from acquisitions will be $30 million. And in terms of future spend do you want to...","William L. Meaney","I think it's hard to say what we can and we can't do in terms of acquisitions. We don't see a need on the -- this year, we obviously didn't need to do a major equity raise. So I suppose these things are always possible, but this year, for sure, we didn't have to contemplate anything like that to do the acquisitions that we have.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. But if something was to be more material, where it wasn't the smaller acquisitions that are out here, is equity a potential tool that you could use?","Roderick Day","Yes, equity is always a potential tool, but I don't like to talk about hypotheticals when -- because it depends on what the markets are doing and everything else. So -- but I mean, equity and debt are always the tool that you have when you're investing in your business or doing acquisitions. But, as I said, this past year, we didn't have to contemplate that.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And just to be clear, that $30 million benefit from M&A in 2015, that's -- you said, Rod, that, that was from the acquisitions that have been completed year-to-date, that doesn't include any potential acquisitions?","Roderick Day","Yes, that's exactly right, Justin, that's where we're at. And then, clearly, if we are to do more, there will be more coming through. We'll obviously look to update the guidance at the end of next quarter on this because it can be a material impact on our numbers, but that's kind of where we're heading at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to start just a little bit on Slide 9, just going over some of the trends over there. On the bottom chart, in Records Management volume growth, since the beginning of the year, we've seen the out firm terminations go down. I was wondering how much of that is kind of a natural change that you're seeing? And how much of that had to do with the contracting -- proactive contracting changes that you guys made? And should we expect that to continue to improve through the course of next year?","William L. Meaney","Shlomo, it's Bill. It's a good question. I think that what I would say is that we're down to really where you would expect to be, roughly around the -- we're at 1.9%. So yes, the 2% to 1.9%, I think is probably the right level of that. And I wouldn't say it was even the contracting terms, I think it just came down to good customer service and good customer management. I think -- quite frankly, we had take our eye off the ball. We've introduced some software and tools, which I think we discussed at Investor Day, which has really helped us identify when we were kind of off the point in terms of customer service so that we could intervene before we had what I would call a significant customer service failure. So I think that has helped. So we've been able to play a lot better defense by keeping our customers happy and servicing them more proactively, and that's really helped a lot. So, believe it or not, it's just been focusing on the basics of the business rather than any magic from either contracting or anything else. But I think at some point, I think that clearly, the 2.7%, if you look back in Q4 of 2012, was way too high. And I think we're getting to the levels that I think a business with a good customer service apparatus would be targeting. So I think we're in the zone now.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And I appreciate that. What about the organic side of the business over there -- we saw 6.8 going down to 6.1. Is that -- where is your sense of that kind of stabilizing? And is that the manifestation of kind of industry trends? How should we think of it? I know clearly, the goal is to offset the 2 that we're talking about right now, just trying to gauge if that's going to be kind of -- you've achieved the optimum. Or where you think you can get on the bottom? Where we are on that side of it?","William L. Meaney","I think -- look, I think part of it is driven by mix, quite frankly. In other words -- and not just in the North American versus international, but even the country mix within international, there are certain countries that we find that we're going into that are really at the early stages of outsourcing, and there are other ones that we're entering and they are more mature in their outsourcing, so they have lower growth rates. The other thing is -- and also being honest about it is that there's -- it's more art than science how we split between the new sales and the organic. Because in the new sales, it's both new logos and new business opportunities with existing customers. So it's a little bit -- so you have to kind of look at both numbers together, but I would say right now is -- clearly, in the mature markets is that we've always said they're kind of in the 6% to 7% range. Some of them are more trending towards the 6%. Some of them are still kind of in the upper 6% to 7%. And then the other thing is even in the emerging markets, we find quite significant variances between what the organic growth rate is in different countries. So some of the organic growth rates in some of the emerging markets, for instance, is north of 10%, and others is at 7%. So I think it's both a country mix issue. I think it's even within the developed markets, there's a mix across countries. And then the other aspect about it is there is an art rather than scientific split between new sales and the organic.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just a couple of other ones. Rod, will changes to FX impact the $4.10 to $4.20 in dividends expected for 2015?","Roderick Day","I guess it would depend on the extent of any FX change. I think sitting where we are today, we would be pretty comparable with that range. But I suppose I'm just putting a caveat out there, if things were to take a real, significant turn for the worse in terms of a real material strengthening of the dollar, we just have to sort of reserve the right to have a look at that.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Sure. But just leaving the exchange rates where they are today and just carrying them forward, you're comfortable with that $4.10 to $4.20?","Roderick Day","Yes, that's fine. But as I -- Shlomo, we've seen quite a marked shift just in the last month. So, it may even come back to our advantage, but it is a bit volatile at the moment.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Sure, got it. And then finally, Bill, where do you guys stand in terms of going after the smaller business and the Cornerstone acquisition? I noticed it was kind of a strategic, a little bit more platform over there. We talked about progress in prior quarters. Can you just give us an update there?","William L. Meaney","Yes, thanks. That's a good question. Well, first of all, I think that we still remain focused on what I would call that middle market, because that tends to be, say both very fragmented and very unvended, right? So we think that's kind of a really interesting area, and there's a lot of growth in that segment. So I would say that it's early days in terms of us fully capturing the revenue synergies, if you will, or kind of the D&A synergies that we aim to get from the Cornerstone in the sense that, this year, we did the reorganization, the whole sales force. So the sales force is aligned to go after that highly fragmented and unvended middle market, but we've concentrated our training this year more on the verticals. And this -- in 2015, actually starting I think it's next quarter, so the last quarter of this year and early in 2015 is we're really focusing, rolling out both our training in performance management associated with that unvended middle market part of the segment where Cornerstone played quite well at.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And is pricing higher or lower over there versus the larger...","William L. Meaney","It tends to be higher, and -- but also, the service cost is higher associated with these, because these are smaller -- obviously smaller customers. So we do see a correlation between size of customer and pricing, but also, our cost is different, servicing this.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?","Roderick Day","Actually, I just wanted to make a clarification. In my statement earlier, I think I said that we would -- our current liquidity is $1.2 million. We're actually down to our last $1 billion as opposed $1 million. So I should have said $1.2 billion. Just so, in case anyone was having a heart attack. So, thanks.","William L. Meaney","Thank you very much. Thanks for all your time, and we'll speak to you next quarter. Thanks.","Roderick Day","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12704":["Iron Mountain, Inc.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. And welcome, everyone to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may have noticed that we've modified our reporting to include a short slide presentation that will be referenced during today's prepared remarks. The user controlled slides are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast.

After our prepared remarks, we will open up the phones for Q&A.","Referring now to page two of the presentation, today's call, this slide presentation and our supplemental financial information, will contain forward-looking statements most notably our outlook for 2017 financial and operating performance.

In addition, we use several non GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting a solid fourth quarter and full year results for 2016. Before I discuss in more detail our results, I want to point out that both the quarter and the year witnessed major progress on continuing as well as enhancing the durability of our business. This has been marked by continued strong internal volume and revenue growth before all acquisitions in our developed or mature markets.","Moreover, we further extended our business model into the faster and higher growth emerging markets. Additionally, we continue to building on our brand and reputation, serving 940 of the Fortune 1000 companies through our growth and expansion in Adjacent Businesses. A major support to all three pillars of durability has been the transformative nature of the Recall acquisition where we are ahead of plan in most areas. This transformative acquisition is having a major impact on both the financial and strategic goals of our company.","Turning to a more detailed overview of our progress in these areas, total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core storage fundamentals were in line with our expectations, both on an internal and total basis. Notably, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 50 basis points, a sequential improvement over Q3, reflecting continued margin expansion as a result of Recall acquisition synergies and our Transformation Initiative, whilst integrating the historically lower margin Recall business. We also achieved storage internal revenue growth in Q4 of nearly 3%, internal volume growth was also positive in all storage segments and averaged 1.7% for the quarter. New volume from existing customers of more than 30 million cubic feet was consistent with the past few years, demonstrating the consistency of customer behavior related to storage of new regulatory and legal documents. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration related activity.","Stuart will have more shortly on our updated guidance for the year, which reflects consistent performance, expectations for the core business fundamentals, continued strong growth in high-single to low-double digits on an internal basis in our Adjacent Businesses and our Other International segment, which excludes Australia, updated foreign exchange expectations, the expected impact from the reinvestment of some Transformation savings into innovation and further efficiency initiatives, and our expected cash available to support distributions and growth investment.","Returning to our overall summary, slide 4 is a quick review of progress against our 2020 strategic plan during the year. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we continued to drive positive storage rental internal growth for the year with 1.9 million cubic feet of internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis. In terms of our progress of expanding our business model into faster growing emerging markets, we are just shy of 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, a major improvement over 10% just three years ago. Year-over-year progress was also supported by our other transactions in four additional new countries. In addition, we acquired tuck-in businesses in existing markets in Western and Eastern Europe that strengthened our market positions there.","In Adjacent Businesses, we achieved strong topline growth in our data center business where we continued to see attractive complementary opportunities. In October, we broke ground on our 80-acre site in Northern Virginia, which remains one of the strongest data center markets in the country. We expect to bring the first of four buildings online in the third quarter, and once fully built out, this site will more than quadruple our existing capacity. Whilst the construction is under way, we continue to see good momentum and are managing the development of new space in our underground data center in Boyers, Pennsylvania, to address both new customer demand as well as growth from existing customers.","Between our Boston facility and the underground data centers in Boyers and Kansas City, we continue to see internal growth in excess of 20% in this business area, albeit off a relatively small base. We also solidified our leadership position in art storage with two tuck-ins during the year, Fairfield and Cirkers. We continue to see opportunities for consolidation in this storage market segment.","Combining expansion in both Emerging Markets as well as Adjacent Businesses, we made good progress in 2016 with shifting our revenue mix in line with our 2020 plan goals as you can see on slide 5. As we noted in the past, we have an objective to reach 25% of total revenues from our higher growth portfolio. Supported by the acquisition of Recall, we are now quite close to 20% of our mix coming from these businesses. As I mentioned, our guidance includes M&A and near double-digit organic growth to support this transition, both in Emerging Markets as well as in Adjacent Businesses. As this shift progresses, we expect to see faster EBITDA growth and expansion in ROIC.","Turning to progress on the benefits from Recall integration on slide 6, as we noted last quarter, we've gotten off to a great start with integrating Recall's business and implementing actions that enabled us to achieve synergies faster than our original expectations. The integration has gone well. Our cultures were similar, thus enabling us to quickly combine teams and advancing number of objectives that were key to achieving the synergies. As you can see, the financial impact is flowing through very strongly, and we are early in seeing some of the potential for further benefit in having by far the leading global platform.","Our guidance assumes $80 million of net synergies to be realized in 2017, and roughly $65 million of that was included in our 2016 exit rate. Overall, when combined with the $100 million of cumulative benefits from our total $125 million Transformation Program, we expect to generate a $180 million of combined savings impact for 2017, with roughly $20 million of that to be reinvested into innovation and shared service efficiency programs. I'll have more on that shortly.","Turning to Transformation on slide 7, when we started this effort in mid-2015, our three decades of acquisitions had left us with overly complex reporting structures, overlapping teams and processes and overhead costs that had ballooned to more than 28% of sales. That was four to five percentage points higher than most companies our size and breadth. So, we committed to further reduce our overhead by 2018 into transformed teams and processes to enable us to work faster and more efficiently. We've made a lot of good progress to-date entering 2017 with our overhead as a percentage of sales including Recall at just under 25%, and excluding Recall at 24%. We have plans to derive this next $25 million of Transformation benefit from moving to a new model for delivering HR, finance, and IT functions.","Moving forward, each of these functions will leverage best-in-class shared service providers to scale their service to our business partners around the world. Doing so allows us to retain cash for reinvestment and dividends without compromising our goal of having global excellence or centers-of-excellence. For example, the transformation of our finance function will include implementing a single finance system across the world to improve the consistency of our reporting and processes.","Similarly, the HR team's globalization effort will include implementing a standard people management system across the business. These shifts will require an investment this year that will slightly exceed the in-year benefits of our Transformation Program, which is reflected in our guidance. We expect this work to take the better part of this year with timelines varying by function and country. Stuart will have more in a few minutes on the impact of this on 2017 guidance.","The pace of our progress in Integration and Transformation can be seen in the year-over-year comparisons of financial performance on slide 8. Whilst the weighted average increase in our shares outstanding for 2016 relative to 2015 is roughly 16.5%, our growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO exceed the growth in share count. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 13% in the fourth quarter so the majority of this improvement is going directly to shareholders without compromising future growth.","Switching gears for a moment on slide 9, we've all seen the linkage between rising interest rates and REIT public market valuations. And cycles have shown in the past that rising interest rates and rising inflation often go hand in hand. Given that we are a real estate company generating the majority of our profits from rental related activity, we believe we are unique among REITs in our ability to pass through inflation in the form of upward-only CPI type escalators in our contracts.","As our storage gross margins are 75%, the CPI escalators on our rental income have a positive and compound effect on margins, especially during periods of high inflation. Additionally, when we do have the opportunity to leverage inflation, it happens more quickly than for a typical REIT as we have shorter duration storage rental contracts on average of three years for large customers and one year for small customers, which allows for more timely price adjustments.","Furthermore, a portion of our customers have auto renewal contracts for which we implement quarterly pricing contracts or changes on a rolling basis that are tied to CPI. And I would note that the shorter term rental contracts are balanced against our average box age of 15 years coupled with 98% customer retention. So, the average customer stays with us for 50 years, supporting durability of the rental income stream.","In terms of rising interest rates, we don't generally see an impact on customer storage requirements and the net operating income we derive from storage related activities doesn't change if the market value of the underlying real estate fluctuates. Our storage internal revenue growth has less variability than the same-store NOI and other real estate sub-sectors as we demonstrated during the great financial crisis or GFC. Lastly, effective control of real estate through long term leases with multiple extension options means we aren't as impacted by fluctuations in the value of underlying real estate.","Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I'd like to say a few words of how we think about investing in new products and innovation. You may have seen our news a couple weeks ago that Fidelma Russo will join us as Chief Technology Officer in mid March. We are very excited to have Fidelma coming on board from Dell EMC, where she served as Senior Vice President and General Manager for the technology company's Enterprise Storage and Software business, one of the largest units of the EMC business. This is a new position that we're creating to respond to our customers who are increasingly asking us for enhanced solutions to their needs around information storage and data extraction.","In a sentence, our innovation efforts are focused on customer solutions and processes that can further strengthen our differentiation and support growth in service and storage. We have discussed some of these items previously and look forward to sharing more of these with you at Investor Day on the April 20. Fidelma will build upon the strong momentum established by our existing technology team lead by Tasos Tsolakis.","I'd like to thank Tasos for all he's done for our company over the years. Tasos transformed our IT function into a strategic enabler for the business. And over the last several years, he led our business improvement initiatives, most recently being the integration of Recall and our Transformation Program. Tasos has delivered enormous value in his time here and he leaves behind a highly capable team. We thank Tasos for his contributions and we wish him continued success in his future endeavors.","In summary, 2016 was a very good year with solid execution on all three pillars of our strategic plan as well as closing and successfully integrating Recall, making Iron Mountain the most global of information management companies. All of these accomplishments in the near term support increased sustainable cash flow and our ability to grow the dividend consistently, whilst continuing to de-lever, and even more importantly, longer term, they provide us with an enhanced strategic position.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be reporting on another strong quarter and the continued success of our operations team to grow our customer base and control costs. Before diving into the details, let me first quickly cover a couple of administrative items. To simplify our reporting, we have made certain terminology and definition changes.","First, we are no longer using the term adjusted OIBDA and have replaced it with adjusted EBITDA. It's purely a terminology change. The measurement itself and historical numbers remain the same. EBITDA is easier for me to pronounce and simpler for new investors following the company. Second, we tweaked our future AFFO definition. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will eliminate the deduction of discretionary growth capital, which we refer to as innovation investment as well as add back all depreciation and amortization, which will be more consistent with how other REITs treat certain non-cash adjustments. More detailed explanations of these changes are on slide 17 of this presentation.","Let's now turn to results. Our 2016 performance was generally in line with expectations as a result of the tremendous effort by the organization to successfully integrate Recall while delivering on our Transformation Initiative as Bill discussed.","Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the key financial results of the quarter. First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.9% excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions. This is up from 2.1% in the third quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Second, we very effectively enhanced our profitability. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 31.7% with storage and service gross margin improvement, reflecting benefits from both Transformation and Recall synergies. Third, the integration of Recall continued on track, and we entered 2017 with a $65 million annual run rate of net synergies toward our target of $80 million to be realized in the year.","Now, let me quickly review our full year 2016 results compared to our guidance on slide 10. Both on a reported dollar basis and on a 2016 constant dollar basis, performance was generally within the ranges of our guidance. The 2016 constant dollar budget rate was set in January 2016 and currency changes had a minor positive benefit in our reported results compared to budgeted rates. Revenue both on a reported basis and a 2016 constant dollar basis was squarely within guidance. AFFO came at the high end of our expectations as we leveraged our scale and optimized our capital expenditures. Approximately 80% of the capital expenditure reductions were permanent as we implemented more cost effective solutions or eliminated spending, while the remainder was deferred into 2017.","On a constant dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA was within our range despite the lower overall profitability of the legacy Recall business. As we mentioned on prior calls, pre-acquisition, Recall had a lower margin profile compared to Iron Mountain's base business. Going forward, we continue to believe that we can optimize the legacy Recall business and bring it in line with our profitability levels. Adjusted EPS for the full year came in slightly below our guidance range due primarily to real estate depreciation, which does not impact FFO or AFFO being non-cash. Re-negotiations of several legacy Recall leases resulted in shorter asset lives than expected. Therefore, real estate depreciation was higher than anticipated.","Let's now turn to slide 11 which shows our key financial metrics. Fourth quarter top-line growth of 24.2% was driven by acquisitions and strong internal storage revenue growth, slightly offset by foreign exchange headwinds compared to a year ago.","The fourth quarter total revenue growth rate was slightly lower than the third quarter, reflecting divestitures. The internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter of 2.9% was driven primarily by net internal records management volume growth of 1.7%. Internal volume growth was positive in all of our major markets.","Service revenues increased 24.8% in the fourth quarter, but declined 0.9% on an internal basis primarily due to declines in transportation and handling activities as well as Western European service projects. As we've highlighted in previous calls, service business growth rates can fluctuate as on a relatively small basis and our mix is shifting towards more project-based revenues. We continue to focus on sustaining and gradually improving gross profits as services are complementary to our core records management and data storage businesses.","The growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was driven by top line growth and acquisition benefits. In addition, we continued to benefit from our Transformation Initiative and Recall synergies. As a result, we've improved our adjusted EBITDA margins sequentially and year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins improved from the third quarter by 50 basis points to 31.7%. Year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10 basis points as we effectively leveraged SG&A costs despite headwinds from Recall's lower gross profit margin.","The total gross profit margin continued to trend positively from Q3 as we realized Recall synergies and optimized operations. Compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter gross margin declined due to the mix of Recall's lower margins. Recall's gross margins as we've highlighted had higher rent expense, as pre-acquisition, at least close to 90% of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies to more than offset this gross margin decline resulting in the expansion of adjusted EBITDA margins.","Let's turn quickly to slide 12 to cover financial performance by segment for the quarter. Before speaking to specific performance, it's important to understand the relative size of each segment and its contribution to the results. The pie chart on this slide shows the relative size of revenue to each business segment, split by storage and service. Storage provided more than 80% of our fourth quarter adjusted gross profit, while service provided less than 20%. While we continue to innovate on new service offerings for our customers, it is important to keep in mind the impact of service declines and increases.","For example, North American data management service revenues are less than 4% of total revenues, so the overall North America data management business continues to be highly profitable with increasing margins. In North America records and information management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue growth continued to be strong. This performance was driven by price improvement and volume growth. The improvement we saw in the North American internal service revenue was partly driven by the on-boarding of a large retail customer in the shred business for whom we began providing ongoing destruction services in over 10,000 locations. In North America data management, we saw strong internal storage rental growth revenue of 3%, reflecting an improvement from the third quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the ongoing reduction of tape rotation as we discussed previously. The adjusted EBITDA margin in North America DM increased over last year to 54.4%.","The internal storage rental revenue growth in Western Europe has also improved from the third quarter. However, revenues were impacted by certain contract renegotiations that we mentioned on prior earnings calls. The Western European adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year due to Recall's lower margin business, overhead costs which are not yet fully synergized and a reduction in service project revenue compared to a year ago. In the Other International segment, which now includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continued to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth and improving margins.","Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business. The first two pie charts on slide 13 reflect our revenue and adjusted EBITDA composition by U.S. dollar and other currencies based on fourth quarter results, which includes Recall's more global business. As you can see, roughly 60% of worldwide revenues are generated in the U.S., and importantly close to 70% of adjusted EBITDA is in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations may be more muted on adjusted EBITDA than many realize.","Also, we have matched our foreign-denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax efficient. As of year-end, 23% of our debt was in non-U.S. currencies.","Let's turn to guidance for 2017 as summarized on page 14 of the deck. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged. We expect storage rental growth of 2% to 2.5% and solid growth in our emerging markets and adjacent businesses. We refined 2017 guidance from our preliminary outlook presented in November due to negative currency impacts and finalizing our back-office shared service initiatives and innovation-related plans. Our guidance is now based on 2017 constant dollar budget rates, which reflects and holds constant January 2017 exchange rates.","Next year, we plan to issue initial guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call consistent with many of our peers. Our 2017 guidance also reflects the full-year impact of divestitures of legacy Iron Mountain businesses in Australia and Canada, which represent a full-year impact of approximately $47 million in revenues.","Please note that 2017 guidance excludes Recall integration cost of approximately $135 million. For full-year 2017, at the midpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding about 200 basis points to around 33%. We remain confident with the Recall synergy expectations as we continue to successfully integrate the two businesses. Further, our guidance assumes we invest about $20 million in operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared services programs that Bill mentioned. So not all of the savings from our Transformation program will flow through to the bottom line. These extra costs are expected to disproportionately hit the first quarter given our kickoff of the shared service programs.","Please note that due to the rapid integration with Recall, it is difficult to isolate integration benefits from Transformation benefits, so we'll be reporting these benefits together through the improvement in our overall adjusted EBITDA margins. Also, I'd like to point out that we will no longer be guiding to FFO as we believe AFFO is more representative of the cash generation characteristics of our operating businesses and provides a better measure for dividend coverage. In 2017, AFFO is expected to grow by 11.5% at the midpoint compared to 2016 supporting our dividend growth. Included in AFFO is the expectation that maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments will be between $150 million and $170 million.","Regarding allocation of capital to real estate ownership, we plan on optimizing our real estate portfolio through capital recycling. This means funding purchases through selling buildings in non-strategic locations while cap rates are at near all-time lows, and using the proceeds to purchase properties in more strategic locations. These types of programs enable us to take advantage of market pricing opportunities, enhance our utilization, and ensure we own properties in key markets. Our strategy remains to invest where the value creation is most compelling and reflects the best use of capital which generates the highest returns. Our guidance also assumes that we invest $160 million to $180 million in business acquisitions and acquisitions of customer relationships primarily building market share as we consolidate in our emerging markets.","Turning to slide 15 and our cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD; for 2017, we expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend, required capital expenditures, core growth racking, and a portion of our discretionary investments. As a result, inherent in our guidance is an assumption that we would have approximately $125 million of capital available after funding the dividend to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-creating investments, and require $200 million of external funding for the remainder excluding Recall costs.","Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we had liquidity of nearly $1 billion at year-end and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times, which was in line with expectations. In the short-term, given the timing and proceeds of divestitures and investments related to innovation and shared services, we expect our leverage ratio to remain above long-term targeted levels and then trend down as we fully realize the synergies and Transformation benefits and continue internal growth.","Overall, we are pleased with our 2016 performance and with the progress we've made integrating Recall and executing on Transformation. Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our high-margin storage rental business, and we're extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan, including capitalizing on value-creating growth investments and optimizing our costs and capital expenditures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before Q&A.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thanks, Stuart. And before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to reiterate that we are pleased with our performance in what was a very eventful yet positive year for the company. We successfully integrated Recall. We achieved strong performance in the business with solid operating fundamentals, and are excited by further opportunities in both emerging markets and the adjacent business area.","Our guidance for this year calls for solid gains in revenue, EBITDA, and AFFO, and that we expect will drive durable cash flow to support investment for both long-term growth as well as consistent increases in our quarterly dividend in line with our earlier expectations. We look forward to updating you on our multiyear plan at our upcoming Investor Day on April 20.","With that, operator, I'd like to open up to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And your first question will be from Kevin McVeigh of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. Great job on the quarter. Hey, the internal growth's really strong at 2.9% bringing the full-year to 2.3%. Wanted to figure out how Recall factors into that. And then I know it's not included in. When it does, is that what kind of causes the range of 2% to 2.5% for 2017 appreciating. It's up from 2.3% for 2016 overall, but is 2% to 2.5%, how do we think about that relative to the 2.9% you put up in Q4 and again really nice job there.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Kevin, and welcome back.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Bill. Great to be back.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So you've got it right on the head, Kevin. So, basically, just to be clear, the internal growth is calculated on excluding Recall, right.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So it is purely internal growth. But, at the same time, it's including as the business has gone through the course of the year, it's including internal growth on the acquired portion of the Recall business. So that's why we're guiding next year for the 2%, 2.5% because the denominator will change in terms of that calculation. So you're right, it's very strong performance in the growth in the fourth quarter, but the denominator will change slightly in terms of the calculation going into 2017. So the guidance range is between 2%, 2.5%.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. That's super helpful. And then in terms of how should we think about overall CapEx with maintenance being kind of $150 million to $170 million, as we think about the business overall, are we getting to a point where the total percentage starts to come down as you become more efficient in consolidation and things like that?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Hey, Kevin, this is Stuart.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Stuart.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, over time it will. We still in 2017 will have a little bit I'll call it of above-average run rate. Some of that's just due to the maintenance that we've got on some of the Recall facilities that are flowing through in 2016 and 2017 and then after that it should be trending down.","Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Awesome. And thanks again, congrats.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Andrew. I think you zipped through North America RIM storage number real quick. 1.9% growth for the quarter and 1% for the year really is kind of a record level of growth for that segment. It might sound glacial, but you haven't done 1% organic in North America in RIM storage since 2012, and so just it feels like there's some momentum in that business. Do you agree with that assessment?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, look, I think \u2013 good morning, Andrew. I think it is a fair \u2013 you probably know, I'm kind of always a glass-is-half-empty person focusing on what we have to do rather than what we've done. But, no, I think the North American team has made some really good progress, both on the volume side and on the pricing side, so I think it's starting to flow through. But there's always more that we can do, but I think you're right. I think they've done a nice job. And as you know, nothing happens really fast in this business. In fairness, it's not something that they've done in the last quarter or the last year. It's something that they've been doing over the last three years.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And could you just make a quick comment about 2017 for services organic, will that be close to flat this year?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, Andrew. Yeah, that will be close to flattish. Again, you've got to remember, the service internal growth doesn't really have as big an impact as it flows through to gross profit in the bottom line, but flattish \u2013 it will be plus or minus 1% to 2%.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. You are achieving Recall net synergies faster than you originally expected. Can you discuss where the upside in synergies is coming from? And if you see room for your original synergy targets to go higher?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Okay. Good morning, George. Well, first of all, I think we are getting, as you pointed out, faster and I think we talked about that on the Q3 call. I think it really comes down to, first of all, before especially being a public takeover, to take over a public company, our level of diligence before we could close the deal was limited, right. So we had to make certain assumptions and we tend to be conservative in those assumptions until we actually can open the barn door, so to speak, and see what's there. So the good news is that we have been able to execute a lot harder and lot faster in terms of getting the synergies than what we had forecasted based on really almost publicly available data or very limited diligence. So that's the good news. And it sets us up well for 2017 where our target is $80 million and we already had $65 million exit rate in 2016.","In terms of getting more, we're still working through the upside. As we've always said, we do expect that there will be additional synergies coming out of this acquisition and we always consider that most likely or most probably in the real estate segment, and we're continuing to pick through that. The good news is some of that may come through quicker because of the shorter leases that we pointed out, but it still has to be a location-by-location basis. So we're not forecasting an uptick in the overall synergies at this point, but we're pleased by the progress we've made so far.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. You indicated plans to reinvest $20 million of your combined $180 million in Recall synergies and Transformation savings for 2017. Can you elaborate on these investments and when you might expect to see benefits?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Okay. It's a good point. I think that any continuous improvement \u2013 think of Transformation as a continuous improvement program. It's any of those things that you would expect that you're going to reinvest when you have the right opportunities into the business. But it is fair to say that the first tranches of the Transformation program flowed straight through to the bottom line. So the two areas that we're investing: one of them think about getting the last $25 million of the Transformation benefits or the continuous improvement benefit is associated with shared services in our IT and HR and finance functions. And that's going to require some double running while we transition to new service providers in those areas and some upfront investments. So that's one part of that $20 million is that we will have some double running cost during 2017, which will effectively mean that $25 million of next tranche of Transformation benefit won't be self funding in the year, right. So that's part of it.","And then the other part of it is in line with bringing Fidelma onboard to further accelerate what we've been doing over the last couple years and investing more in technology on behalf of our customers so that they can get more out of the information that we're storing for them. You'll see some of that on Investor Day, some of the investments that we're making and what we call innovation on behalf of our customers. So some of it goes into that and as Fidelma further builds on the team that we have there.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah, makes sense. And lastly, your Records Management internal volume growth was relatively consistent with prior quarters in the 1.7% range, but your internal storage revenue growth accelerated to 2.9% in the quarter. Can you discuss the drivers behind that I guess particularly pricing?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I think that we are making some progress. As I pretty much say on every quarter, and also kind of reiterating part of my answer to Andrew, is nothing happens quickly in this business, because the good news is it's a highly durable, stable business; the bad news is it's a highly durable, stable business. In other words, any change I make today takes some time to actually start flowing through. And, as you know, that we've been working an making sure that we're getting the right value, i.e. price for some of the services that we're working on and that's starting to show real benefits, so.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe this one is for Stuart. I'm just trying to bridge the $30 million lowering of the top end of the guidance range; this $20 million seems to be coming from increased investments, what's the other $10 million coming from and then afterwards I'd like discuss, is the increased investment a pull forward from 2018 or is this just increased investment so just less expectation for profitability because of that?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, Shlomo, I think that if you're focused on EBITDA, I think maybe the simplest way to look at it is to start with the Q4 run rate that we've got, so we start with a Q4 run rate of just under $300 million and if you annualize that, that's going to get you to almost $1.2 billion, $1.188 billion.","You got to remember in Q4 also we were having increasing synergies and Transformation benefits. So not all that flows through the quarter. So you have to annualize those benefits as well. That will get you about $40 million and you're going to have organic growth goes on in the business, right, every year. It's about 2%. And so that will get you about $25 million.","Then you've got some incremental synergies that we've talked about, the difference between incremental synergies to be actioned in 2017, that's about $15 million and then you've got M&A activities that we have built in the guidance, which will give you about $10 million of EBITDA in 2017.","You take all that together and you get to almost $1.280 billion when you add those up. And then we talked about the $20 million that we're going to be reinvesting back into shared services and innovation, that gets you close to $1.260 billion which is close to the midpoint of the guidance of $1.265 billion, that's the easiest way to sort of walk through the change from where we're going from 2016 into 2017.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","What changed last quarter to this quarter, just is it all the $20 million, is there something else that's in there and also...","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","If you're looking at guidance in November to guidance now, it's really the $20 million and the FX rate that had a negative impact as well. Those are the two main changes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","But hasn't there been somewhat of an offsetting impact from rising paper prices also from November?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. You could be, but we've assumed in guidance right now that the paper prices stay consistent from 2016 \u2013 right, they're volatile. So we've assumed that 2016 stays on average flat with 2016 at about $140-$145 recycled (sic) [recycled sorted office] paper pricing.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then the $20 million of costs that are coming in for this investment, is this something that is a pull forward from 2018 that you're expecting to happen in 2018 or is this just a new investment program here?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I mean, you'll start getting the return to the benefits from them really more in 2018. So you think about the back office shared services that Bill talked about. We'll have double running costs this year, so in 2018 those double running costs go away and then we start to take back office costs out. So those will continue to have benefits as well as the revenue growth that we expect and some of the other innovations will really start to benefit 2018 as well.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","What I'm getting at with this question is really, we had a certain expectation for a combination of both Transformation and Integration synergies in 2018. Is this cost investment of $20 million then increase the number that we were expecting in total because there was $125 million from Transformation, you had about $100 million from Recall Synergies, does that now go up because we have this investment program in 2017, so does the aggregate number start to go up for 2018?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","It's going to be \u2013 yeah, what I'd tell you is that, and Bill sort of touched on it, we've really moved Transformation into a continuous program to really take cost out of the business, and improve capital deployment and keep growing the business. So what you'll do is, yeah, you should continue to see margin improvement in 2018 and 2019 as benefits from these in terms of, are we going to specifically call them out as Transformation benefits. I don't think we're going to sort of specify them that way.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I think it's a good try, Shlomo, for us to kind of give you 2018 guidance, but we're not going to do that. I mean, I think you can take it to the bank that we're investing $20 million back into the business because we expect to get a return on that. But to give you what the exact return on that's going to be in 2018, I'm not going to tell you. I mean you know that we're going to have $25 million of more Transformation benefit, so part of that $20 million goes to making sure that we smoothly get to that last $25 million which requires double running cost to get there.","But I'm not going to call out exactly what the return on investment is going to be on the innovation. But I think after the Investor Day, you'll probably have a better view of kind of the things that we're working on, but you're going to have to wait until this time next year for 2018 guidance.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, I'm not asking for 2018 guidance. I'm just asking is it costing more to get there?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","No, I think you can argue that the $25 million of Transformation, so that $25 million of Transformation benefit is, you could argue it's costing us a bit more in the sense that what we always set up the Transformation Program, as much as we possibly could, we would self fund it. In other words, the cost to get the Transformation is we would action things early enough in the year, so that by the end of the year it paid for itself and then you got the full benefit the following year.","On this last $25 million, what we're saying is that we're not going to be able to do that in 2017, but the full benefit will go through. So you could argue that it's costing us more because we're not able to self fund it in the benefit that we're going to get in 2017. I think that's fair.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","In risk of over answering this question, we could have staged it out to match funds, but the right answer for the business was to do HR and IT and finance all at the same time, and since you're doing all those at the same time, you've got more cost upfront and you'll get more of the benefits later on.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then what's the total organic revenue growth implied in the guidance including services?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, if you look at the revenue mix of the 2% to 2.5% storage and the flattish of service, you'll end up plus or minus 2%, unless you have an even number in front of me, because I think of them very differently because they are such different profit margins and such different drivers of the business.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. But in terms of shifting, we're seeing this shift to more emerging markets or starting to shift to adjacencies, I'm just trying to see if we're going to get a shift overall to overall better revenue growth.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","You are seeing some of that. You're already seeing that Shlomo, because you've been watching the story a pretty long time, is you're already starting to see that shift, right, because now, where 20% of the mix now is higher growth and you're starting to see that both on the top and the bottom line starting to \u2013 what I would call wind at our backs in terms of that 2%, 2.5% of storage and overall flattening to slightly positive growth in service. So you are starting to see that kind of build in. But at this point it's more, I would say, wind at your back than a major switch that's been flipped.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thank you, guys.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Justin, can you speak up a little bit because we can barely hear you.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Is that better? Can you hear me now?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, good. So I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit and kind of a two-part question on the capital budget, and maybe I'll start first with just the dividend commitment that you have. One of the things is I mean with all the restructuring, obviously your taxable income is lower than the dividend that you're paying out, so in other words you're paying more dividend than you would be required to as a REIT. And I guess the question is should we think of your dividend commitments that you've given as we kind of get past the restructuring as being more in line with that 90% of taxable income that you're required to or is it your intention to continue to over fund the dividend, if you will?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","I think over time you're going to continue to see us grow into the dividend, right, when we set the expectations for dividend growth out as part of our 2020 plan. That was always in anticipation of getting the synergies and Transformation benefits continuing to grow the business. And so, I think, yeah, so if you look at purely from what's required dividend for being a REIT, we're going to continue to return to shareholders more in dividends than is required, but we're going to grow into that over the next few years.","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that Justin is we think about dividends as capital allocation. So AFFO is really the measure that we focus on, and we try to say okay, what's the right mix between giving capital back to our shareholders through dividends versus reinvesting in the business.","In the 2020 plan as a percentage of AFFO we do see ourselves trending down from say 80% down into the mid to low-70%s, and we continue to expect that that happen over time. But that's much more the \u2013 I mean, what you're saying is true and it's valid, but it's not what we're trying to solve for.","So it's much more of a capital allocation decision, and if you look in the 70%s, low-80%s is that there are a number of REITs that play in that range. So it is true what you're saying, but that's not the metric that we are trying to solve for. We are much more looking at how do we take the AFFO and carve that out between giving money back to shareholders versus growing the business?","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I mean, to paraphrase, I mean it kind of sounds like you're talking about it holistically over a multi-year period is what's forming the dividend policy as opposed to any given year's taxable income?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, exactly.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, I guess, the second question is just, this is the second time and I think it was last quarter, maybe it was the quarter before, but your maintenance CapEx needs to continue to come down, which is obviously a positive for your coverage and the ability to have more capital for the growth initiatives that you've talked about. To what extent is that now done? And is there anything that would be more properly characterized as deferred maintenance as opposed to kind of this is a structural shift in which these are not capital needs that the business actually has?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah. I think the one distinction I've made is the really the real estate, the actual maintenance piece has been pretty well on track with guidance, is the non-real estate CapEx which includes things like back office IT systems at corporate and out in the field, warehouse equipment, that's where we've gone through and really sat down and said, what do we need to be investing in the business or is it better to repair than buy new as well as looking out over the next couple years in terms of system replacements, what can we not replace today and just sort of keep it going and because we're going to upgrade over the next couple of years.","So we've gone through and sort of cleaned back or cut back some of the requests that have gone in that area. I think what you'll see us continue to do is on the maintenance side. Again, it'll be a little bit elevated in 2016 and 2017 because there is some deferred maintenance at Recall that we've got to do and that piece of it will trend down as a percentage of revenue or on a square foot basis.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, so the $150 million to $170 million in 2017, we should think is still a little bit elevated. It comes down a little bit more in 2018 and then it kind of grows in line with revenue?","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right, great. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Hi good morning. I wanted to circle back to a previous question on the organic storage revenue growth trend, so the 2016 forecast was 2.5%, you hit 2.3% last year, and now the 2017 mid point is a deceleration from there despite the fact that you've got more emerging markets in the mix today. I recognize that they are small changes, but it's meaningful given storage's outsized contribution, so just could you explain what you think is causing the deceleration there?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","It goes back to my \u2013 question, so Kevin had it right. You can also say that 2.9% that we had in Q4 was also \u2013 I could show you the opposite Karin that, oh well you're really kind of trending up. I think what you're seeing where we're guiding between the 2% and 2.5% is the denominator is changing out, because don't forget, we integrated Recall. So what's happening is, is that we're getting similar or better continued growth in terms of absolute volume growth, but on a bigger base.","So the 2% to 2.5% is as much \u2013 is mainly a reflection of the denominator. It's not that we're going from 2.9% in Q4 and we're saying, okay, now we're trending down between 2% and 2.5%. It's because in the course of 2016, we had the go-forward growth on a bigger base as we went through the year, although we subtracted the base, the Recall base that we did it on an internal basis. But still the overall base number hadn't been adjusted. So as we start getting into Q3 and Q4 of 2017, you'll see effectively the denominator change. So it's really the math. Not a change in the business.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","But said another way, so because it's organic growth, it's because Recall is growing slower organically than the base \u2013 than the legacy Iron Mountain business, is that right?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Well, it's a little bit slower, yeah, because don't forget we have now a bigger business in Australia and they also had a sizeable business in North America.","Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And the next question will be a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me sneak back in here. I just wanted to ask on the organic growth on storage, does it allocate any growth to Recall or is all the growth of the combined company allocated solely to Iron Mountain?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So the way it works Shlomo is we take out all the Recall base business, so if we bought \u2013 we bought Recall at the beginning of May and if we had a Recall customer that grew from May until the end of the year, the growth on that customer was part of the internal growth number, but the original volume for that customer was excluded.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So any incremental growth from Recall does count as Iron Mountain...","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","... growth? (sic) [Internal volume growth?]","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes.","Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.","So when you look at the volume growth in the supplemental on slides 9 and 10, you'll see the overall trends increasing on new volume from existing customers and new sales, as well as destructions increasing as that volume comes in there, so that's the easiest place to see it.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So it's really just a math exercise over here. So going back to 2% to 2.5% is just more of a normalized thing, it is just kind of elevated because all the growth is allocated to Iron Mountain right now?","William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.","Exactly. Exactly.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And at this time, we have no additional questions.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Greer Aviv","Thank you, Steve. Hello, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast.","You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us\/Investors\/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights press release, the presentation and full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all related documents as one 8-K, available on the IR website.","On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and our 2019 guidance. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A.","Referring now to page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance.","All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we expect to file later today for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in this supplemental financial information.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney","Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. We\u2019re pleased to be here this morning to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 performance. 2018 marked a year of continued strong growth for Iron Mountain highlighted by global storage organic revenue growth, significant growth in our data center business and further scale in our emerging markets.","Turning to slide 3 of our financial results presentation, full year increased 10% which was in line with our expectations, driven in part by the contribution from recent data center acquisitions and strong growth and services. Notably total organic revenue growth was 3.6% for the full year, a strong acceleration from the 2.3% we reported in 2017.","Adjusted EBITDA was also in line with expectations growing 14% year-over-year and resulting in a 120 basis point improvement in our margin. Lastly, we generated 16% growth in AFFO at the high end of our expectations, whilst continuing to reinvest in the growth of our business and supporting our commitment to our dividend. The strong AFFO performance compares to an increase in our fully diluted shares outstanding of 7.4% and resulted in a 160 basis points reduction of our payout ratio to 78%.","As it relates to our fourth quarter performance, we achieved constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% and 12% respectively, whilst our margin expanded a 100 basis points year-over-year. I\u2019ll provide more detail around volume trends in a few minutes.","When on a global organic basis Records Management volume was flat in 2018. Importantly, 2018 was a year of continued evolution for Iron Mountain. We made significant progress in increasing our mix to high growth businesses, completing more than $1.7 billion in targeted acquisitions. This evolution is highlighted by the ongoing expansion of our global data center footprint with the acquisitions of IO, the Credit Suisse Data Centers and EvoSwitch.","We continue to also expand in faster growing emerging markets with acquisitions that increase scale and reach in key markets including South Korea, China and the Philippines.","We continue to build from our strong capabilities and core competencies developed over many decades of managing our customers\u2019 valuable physical and information assets to extend our storage capabilities beyond Records Management and Data Management to a more comprehensive portfolio of physical storage solutions.","Today, we store many of our customers\u2019 valuable assets in addition to information assets, which leverages our know how and utilizes our existing storage facilities and logistics expertise whilst maximizing our revenue in NOI per square foot. To this point, we made targeted acquisitions to further a number of our faster growing businesses, such as market leading Fine Arts and entertainment services capabilities and valley consumer storage.","All of this enables us to help customers manage the storage of valuable assets beyond the more than 690 million cubic feet of records in digital information we store in our Records and Information Management or RIM business area.","Turning to our business performance, Organic Records Management global volume was flat, a modest improvement from Q3 as new volume increased 10 basis points sequentially. More specifically in North America new volumes from existing customers and new sales together increased almost 40 basis points sequentially whilst destructions ticked up 10 basis points.","In a few moments I\u2019ll highlight some of the recent wins in North America Records and Information Management that have helped to support this performance. Volume in the emerging markets continues to grow at a faster clip increasing 7% for 2018 though we saw a modest tick down in new sales compared to Q3.","Our investments are focused on increasing the scale of our businesses in these geographies and growing market share as evidenced by the recent acquisitions I highlighted earlier.","Organic storage revenue growth increased 1.9% and 2.4% year-over-year in Q4 and 2018 respectively, as revenue management continues to contribute positively to growth.","Destructions remain at elevated levels though we saw a moderation in recent trends. Organic service revenue growth was strong in 2018, growing at 5.4% driven in part by continued strength in Secure Shred as well as momentum in digital projects from our Information Governance and Digital Solutions business or IGDS. Overall, we had a successful Q4 with a number of strong new business wins across the North America RIM.","Turning to slide 4, an example of one such win was a 5-year agreement with CitiMortgage, which was looking to outsource their non core business function within their mortgage workflows. Once successfully implemented, we expect to gain 550,000 cubic feet of records plus more than 820,000 files.","Additionally, a new customer signed in Q4 was the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. The Hoover Institution has begun a major renovation of their facilities at Stanford, which will directly impact their archival collections located in three historic buildings. Most of their collections are moving off-site during the renovation some indefinitely and Iron Mountain was selected to relocate 64,000 cubic feet of material from Stanford University to a customized Iron Mountain facility.","Specialized relocation processes designed by our team along with the Hoover archivists and preservationists will be utilized during the move. The collections will be maintained and circulated from our private climate controlled vault modified specifically for this project. This is a great example of our teams working to implement solutions to meet our customer specific needs.","Turning to our federal business, we\u2019ve made significant inroads and further penetrating this historically un-vended channel. Across our entire federal business revenue grew 14% year-over-year in 2018 led by strength in data center and Records Management.","To this point, a U.S. government regulatory agency expanded with a new data center deployment in Northern Virginia adding to their existing deployment in New Jersey. On the Records Management side of the federal business we had net cube growth of 4% during 2018 and continued to see good momentum.","We\u2019re encouraged by the progress made in Q4 in North America and accelerating volume from existing customers and driving new business to Iron Mountain. Another area of solid progress in 2018 was the momentum of our IGDS business as customers increasingly live in a hybrid world of both physical and digital storage.","We recently signed a contract with a large retailer to enhance our value adding services. We\u2019re beginning a digital solution involving more than 75 million images of employee files, which are currently housed on premise at each individual store as part of an HR file conversion project.","Digitizing HR documents and centralizing into a single repository helps achieve greater efficiency, reduce risk and improve compliance with a variety of federal and state requirements. We\u2019re currently in discussions with this customer to assist them in extracting even greater value from their HR information through the use of our InSight platform and its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities.","These are great examples of how we\u2019re solving problems of our customers and adding value in the areas of digital transformation and compliance. We had an extremely active pipeline of opportunities for our IGDS business as we ended 2018, nearly 50% increase over the prior year. Importantly we\u2019re seeing these opportunities increasingly translate into income as revenue is doubled over the past two years.","Regarding our data center business on slide 5, you can see Q4 in 2018 performance was strong with full year revenue of nearly $230 million and adjusted EBITDA of a $100 million. We continue to see solid leasing momentum as we closed out Q4 achieving our targeted 10 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for the year consisting of 261 leases signed with strength in the financial services, professional services and federal vertical.","Of those new and expansion leases 34% were new logos to our data center platform of which 43% had a pre-existing customer relationship with Iron Mountain reinforcing the strength of the Iron Mountain brand and its extension to our data center business.","To that point, we signed a new cloud base provider of medical information in Northern Virginia as this customer was very sensitive to proximity to its own local IT team. Additionally, this customer also has a longstanding relationship with our Data Management team, so our core competencies and compliance and security resonated well with their data center needs.","Another great example of a new customer is Wasabi Technologies, a hot cloud storage company, which deployed in Northern Virginia. Iron Mountain was able to fulfill all of their data center requirements including a hyper scale ready facility which meets the strict compliance requirements for Fed ramp.","Demand from existing customers remain strong with a number of customers expanding their footprint in existing data centers as well as deploying with us in additional markets. A large global bank which came to us as a data center through the IO acquisition increased its capacity needs three times during 2018 expanding its usage in New Jersey by 47%.","Turning to slide 6, our development pipeline reflects construction in key markets including New Jersey, Phoenix, London and Amsterdam as we continue to see good demand from existing customers. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we acquired a part of the land in Frankfurt with power reserved in a permitted design which will ultimately support 20 megawatts of capacity.","Frankfurt is the second largest multi-tenant data center market in Europe beyond London. This land acquisition improves our competitive position across Europe and allows us to have a presence in three of the four key European metro areas. We now have total potential capacity of almost 350 megawatts across our data center platform including the land in Frankfurt and Chicago.","We expect the leasing momentum exiting 2018 will continue into 2019 as we build on our strength with enterprise customers and attract more hyper scale demand. We currently expect to be able to achieve robust leasing activity with a target of executing 15 to 20 megawatts of new and expansion signings in 2019.","Turning to slide 7, our strong performance in 2018 has enhanced the solid foundation we\u2019ve created and increased our financial strength as an organization to support sustained growth. Once our acquisitions from last year are fully incorporated in our base numbers, the business as it is configured today is expected to deliver 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth going into 2020 well in line with our original 2020 plan to exit 2020 with a 5% organic EBITDA growth. This is all compared to less than 2% growth just five years ago.","As it relates to our outlook for 2019, we issued guidance this morning which reflects consistent performance expectations for Records and Information Management business fundamental with further physical storage potential from newer adjacencies.","Ongoing strong growth in emerging markets data center and adjacent businesses and continued investment in the business to support strategic initiatives and innovation around digital solutions to support our customers\u2019 evolving needs.","We do anticipate that the strong dollar will create headwinds over the course of 2019 relative to our reported results, though this has no operational or margin impact. On a constant currency basis we expect revenue growth of 3%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% and AFFO growth of 4.5%. And if we normalize for the impact of adoption of lease accounting our adjusted EBITDA margin would increase by a 100 basis points further.","Stuart will have more detail on our 2019 guidance in a moment. Putting this all into historical context Iron Mountain is entering into 2019 in great shape. Our brand continues to resonate with our customer base where trust is ever more important especially when it comes to information as well as valued assets.","This trusted relationship with more than 225,000 customers in covering over to 95% of the Fortune 1000 is demonstrated both by the continued relevance of our RIM business with expanding margins through higher pricing as well as the rapid growth of our digital solutions business and data center offerings.","In terms of how our services have delivered bottom-line value is worth noting the accelerating growth of the business since 2014. We have grown revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis at a 10% CAGR. AFFO has delivered a 10.9% CAGR with a 7.8% CAGR in share count.","Our business is more diversified both by business line as well as geography all yielding the acceleration in underlining growth mentioned earlier. All together over the past five years we have built significant momentum into the business and feel good going into the year.","We will remain disciplined regarding the pace with which we deploy capital to support these growth initiatives, whilst ensuring we remain true to our financial model.","With that I will turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart Brown","Thank you, Bill and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and 2018 results conference call. We delivered very strong AFFO growth in 2018 of 16% and continue to expand our adjusted EBITDA margins while also achieving 3.6% organic revenue growth. This growth was supported by results of our revenue management program and continued expansion of value add services and our data center platform with growth of records volumes in our international markets offsetting declines in North America.","We are pleased with the healthy performance across our business segments as well as our progress investing in and integrating faster growing businesses. Not only do these new businesses create value for shareholders, but also allow us to be better partner with our customers for their critical physical and digital storage needs.","I'd like to start off the financial discussion with the performance highlights which you can see on slides 8 and 9 of the presentation. For the quarter revenue was in line with expectations approaching $1.1 billion growing about 7% on a reported basis then almost 10% on a constant currency basis. This is driven by contributions from our recent data center acquisitions and strong organic revenue growth including solid contributions from our emerging markets in our businesses.","Total organic revenue grew by 3.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 3.6% for the full year. Organic storage revenue grew 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% or by $60 million for the full year. Organic service revenue grew 6.1% in the fourth quarter and by 5.4% for the full-year. Service growth was primarily driven by increased contributions from our expanding Secure Shred business, continued strength and recycled paper prices as well as additional digitization and special projects.","Our adjusted EBITDA grew over 12% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter to $360 million with margins expanding 100 basis points year-over-year to 33.9%. The margin improvement resulted primarily from the flow through of revenue management, the impact of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard and improved labor productivity.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue excluding significant acquisition costs declined about 80 basis points in the fourth quarter versus a year ago due in part to lower bad debt expense and increased operating leverage on the revenue growth.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per share down from 2017 due mostly to higher depreciation and amortization associated with data center acquisitions and impacted by a 6% increase in shares outstanding following our December 2017 offering to fund the acquisition of I\/O data centers.","For the full year AFFO was $874 million up $122 million or 16% over the prior year reflecting the strong operating performance of our data center acquisitions in a very disciplined approach to capital allocation while continuing our investments in new products and businesses. AFFO came in at the high end of our expectations due to lower cash taxes and interest as well as slightly lower capital spending.","To touch on operating performance in more detail, on slide 10 you can see developed markets organic storage revenue growth came in at 0.9% for the quarter slightly better than Q3 and 1.4% for the full year despite the negative volume growth again reflecting the contribution from revenue management.","Organic service revenue in developed markets increased 5.1% for the quarter and 5.2% percent for the full year due mainly to growth in our shred business, project revenue and digitization projects as mentioned earlier.","In other international, we continued to see healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter. Full-year organic storage revenue growth was 5.4% and 3.2% growth in organic volume. Organic service revenue growth was 6.1% in the quarter and 5% for the full year in this segment.","Further the data center business delivered strong organic revenue growth of 12% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our adjacent businesses also performed well with revenue growth growing almost 19% on an organic basis in the quarter and nearly 11% for the full year.","Turning to slide 11, you can see the detail of our fourth quarter 100 basis point adjusted margin expansion with growth in most segments. We saw a margin decline in North America data management or our tape business driven by lower volumes and mix as well as investments made in growing new products and services.","In the tape storage business the amount of digital data being stored continues to grow, however, greater physical tape density is resulting in lower physical volumes. Revenue management has helped offset some of the tape volume trends and margins have remained north of 50%.","In Western Europe fourth quarter margin expansion returned to levels seen in the first half of the year expanding by 240 basis points reflecting lower bad debt, our focus on continuous improvement and stronger project based revenue in the UK, Germany, and Austria.","In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 41.5% in the fourth quarter and 43.5% for the full year reflecting the increased scale of the business and progress on integration activity. As Bill noted, we are pleased with our leasing activity reflecting the successful integration of a strong commercial team and demand in the markets where we operate.","During the quarter we executed 3.3 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for total 9.6 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily enterprise in Federal Government customers in churn remains quite manageable at 3.2% in 2018.","Turning to slide 12, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the year was 5.6 times comfortably in line with other rates especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors, but we did not have any significant financing activity in the fourth quarter, we did sell two properties as part of our capital recycling program which generated net proceeds of $56 million.","As of December 31, our borrowings were 73% fixed-rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.9% and our well-laddered maturity average is 6.2 years with no significant maturities until 2023. Our strong balance sheet and capital structure is supported by our significant real estate portfolio and long term nature of our customer relationships.","Turning to guidance this is detailed in the supplemental for your review and on slide 13. We\u2019re expecting 2019 revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.08 to a $1.18 and AFFO to be in the range of $870 million to $930 million.","This reflects solid performance following 2018\u2019s growth impacted by a stronger dollar, new lease accounting standard and continuing investments in our Insight IT infrastructure and our data center pipeline.","2019 total organic revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 2% to 2.5% including organic storage revenue growth of 1.75% to 2.5%. Global organic record volumes are expected to be flat with declines in North America offset by growth in other international markets.","Globally we expect new incoming volume to continue offsetting destruction rates of 4.5% to 5% and outperms of around 2%. We expect service organic growth will be the low single digits for 2019 from continued growth in our shred business and information governance in digital solutions. As many of you know, record recycle paper prices were tailwind to our service business in 2018, but we anticipate moderating paper prices in 2019.","We also expect continued strong growth in the data center business with low teens organic revenue growth compared to 2018. We will though have elevated churn in the first quarter in Phoenix due to two customer move outs that were part of our deal underwriting when we acquired IO.","Anticipated investments which are detailed in the supplemental will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings supported by the higher expected adjusted EBITDA. We may also utilize third party capital particularly for data center development and equity from our ATM depending on market conditions. We expect our lease adjusted leverage ratio to improve 10 to 20 basis points from the 5.6 times at the end of 2018.","As we think about 2019 outlook there are several factors affecting comparability that I would like to bring to your attention. First we divested our fulfillment business at the end of Q3, 2018 which generated approximately 25 million in annualized revenue.","Second, the adoption of the new leasing standard is expected to result in a non-cash increase in rent expense of $10 million to $15 million, lower interest expense of $3 million and lower depreciation expense of about $3 million due primarily to certain capital leases converting to operating leases under the standard.","Third, current foreign exchange rates relative to 2018 are expected to result in a $60 million to $70 million headwind to revenue and $20 million to $25 million impact to EBITDA. As a reminder on FX, we derive about 40% of our revenue from non U.S. dollar currencies and as a result exchange rate volatility can't have a significant impact on our reported results.","Well, we have very low transactional exposure with our costs well matched to our revenue in the respective countries, we do have un-hedged translation exposure and somewhat higher proportion of our debt is U.S. dollar denominated.","As the business continues to evolve with data center growth, we will also be reviewing our disclosure to determine where we can make changes to reduce complexity and enhance transparency. You should expect to see some changes to the supplemental beginning in the first quarter.","In summary, as we close out another year of continued growth and evolution we are pleased to see progress on multiple fronts. Our records and information management business continues to deliver durable cash flow and steady organic revenue growth through solid revenue management. We've had continued success extending into higher growth in emerging markets and our fast-growing data center business and adjacent businesses continue to increase scale and have become very competitive platforms poised for even greater success.","We are pleased with the adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and dividend growth rates achieved in 2018 and the contributions from our team serving customers around the world and look forward to strong performance again in 2019.","With that I will turn over the call to Bill for closing remarks before we open up for Q&A.","William Leo Meaney","Thank you, Stuart. And just a couple of comments before we begin the question and answer is, first of all, it was a very strong year, which was punctuated by double-digit EBITDA and AFFO growth well ahead of the shares we issued to support our acquisition of the IO data center.","The business also has never been stronger or better positioned, continued organic storage revenue growth with remaining untapped storage segments or reserves, a broader range of businesses and services still tied to our existing business relationships built on decades of trust and accelerating organic growth of EBITDA and AFFO which underpins future dividend growth whilst de-levering.","With that operator I'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nathan Crossett with Berenberg. ","Nathan Crossett","Hi, good morning. Maybe you can just talk a bit about your appetite for further data center acquisitions. I know you have plenty of room to build out based on the current pipeline. But wanted to get your thoughts on just outright acquisitions. Is it possible to see some more EvoSwitch type transactions going forward?","William Leo Meaney","Good morning, Nate. Look I wouldn't rule it out but it's not really what we think we need to do in the plan. In other words the EvoSwitch, if you think about EvoSwitch specifically which as a good example is we look at the top 10 international markets and the top 10 U.S. markets and we say okay, do we feel, how do we prioritize those, which ones do we think we should enter. And then, when we look at that is, we look at what's the best way to enter that market.","So Chicago, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt are all great examples where we decided the best way for us to enter that because it's important for our customers that we have decades of relationship with, plus some of our newer customers on the data center side that we have product on the shelf in those key markets and we decided the best way to enter those markets was through Greenfield development which we've done.","In Amsterdam, we looked at the same thing because as you know, in Europe we refer many times to the flat markets, the top markets in Europe are Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris. So Amsterdam is absolutely a key market in Europe and it's one that our customers wanted to see us in. and when we looked at Amsterdam, quite frankly EvoSwitch for us was the best entry point.","So, that's how we think about those markets but if you think about overall in terms of our growth plan, we're now almost 350 megawatts of capacity that we can build out both with sites that we've already started building in the Frankfurt in Chicago site and we feel really good about being able to achieve our financial plan with little or no acquisitions.","Nathan Crossett","Thanks, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, can you talk a bit about this datacenter competition. We've heard from some of the wholesale providers that price can be very competitive in certain markets. So, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts and maybe you could talk a bit about how you're trying to differentiate?","Stuart Brown","I think it's a good question, Nate. I think that well first of all I would differentiate between the enterprise customers in a hyper scale. So, it's fair to say right now, we as Iron Mountain is we're more the bulk of our customers are in the enterprise segment which is what you would expect. We notice that of the new logo who signed this year, 43% of them we already had an existing customer relationship, where then obviously those were enterprise customers.","So, for us I think when you talk about pricing, we see less price sensitivity on the enterprise side quite frankly. So, Iron Mountain hasn\u2019t been exposed to that as much. When you see the analyst talking about the pricing compression, it's more on the hyper scale. Now, what does that mean for us is we do have an appetite to be present in the hyper scale market and I think I've covered this before on the calls and it's more about getting to optimize in the yield on the site.","So, if you look at Northern Virginia which is 82 acres and can build out well north of 80 megawatts of critical IT load. Then if you want to fill that, the rate that you fill it is it's important in some ways as what the specific revenue per kilowatt that you're getting on that site.","So, to fill that out at a pace that we think is optimum, then we would expect that site to be somewhere at when it's fully built out between 40% to 60% hyper scale. Now, on our standpoint is our models are built on current hyper scale pricing. So, I think what you're hearing coming out of the industry is hyper scale pricing has come down and quite frankly these things typically are kind of 8% to 9% cash-on-cash returns.","They are at least approaching that level now but that's where we built our model and that's where we expect our entry point, which are still well above our weighted average cost of capital and it's still a good return. So, I think the noise coming out of the market I think is more about people who have been heavily present in that segment before and they're realizing the pricing is coming down to what I would call the normal clearing price in terms of what a reasonable return is for these very large scale projects which have very long contract duration.","Nathan Crossett","That's helpful, thanks. I'll get back in line.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Yes, good morning. Your EBITDA margins in 2018 continue to improve, just wondering what your outlook for merging improvement is in 2019. Is it achievable to maintain or grow margin in North America in storage. And how is the mix shifting to datacenters driving margin improvement?","Stuart Brown","Yes, hi. Good morning, Sheila, this is Stuart. Just if you look at sort of the midpoint in guidance implies about a 30 basis point improvement in margin and as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks where that's impacted also negatively by the change in lease accountings if you normalize for that it's a 50 basis points to a 100 basis point margin expansion.","And I think you're going to see similar trends in '19 to what you saw in '18 with revenue management continuing to contribute to margin expansion in the developed markets. Emerging markets, you'll see some margin expansion really due to continue in increased scale because we're not we've got pricing program in those market but we're really there focused on driving scale and continuing to increase our market presence.","And then you will get then in the datacenter business or that business grows as a percentage of the total business. You will get some uplift in margins because that business is higher average EBITDA margin than the rest of the business.","Sheila McGrath","And as a follow-up, Bill you mentioned the federal vertical records growth of 4% in 2018. Just wondering how that backlog is looking in 2019 and any insights on how meaningful that opportunity might be?","William Meaney","No, thanks Sheila. No, I think that we expect to continue to build on that, obviously it's with the federal government the gestation period of it is longer than our say normal private enterprise customers. But we continue to see the backlog growing and I think we highlighted our homeland security win on the last call. And we start getting those what I call kind of an iconic brand is the momentum that's starting to build in the business.","And we see that, we see an acceleration in terms of the pipeline. With that being said is that the government is one fiscal budget. So, you work this year to deliver the project generally for next year. But we really like what we see in the pipeline in terms of momentum. So, I would expect that to tick up over time.","Sheila McGrath","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Hi thanks, good morning. You are now several years into your revenue management initiative. Can you provide us with an update on the roll out of revenue management across your geographies and the amount of pricing benefit you expect through 2020?","Stuart Brown","Yes, good morning George. So, first of all in terms of the program is that it's pretty much completely rolled out obviously in North America and now Western Europe. We start rolling it out this year or past last year in 2018 with four centers across the broader international market out beyond Western Europe. So, we expect to see some real traction in those markets whereas Western Europe will be fully online this year, last year was partially online, obviously North America will continue online.","So, what we expect is similar levels of price increase in North America. In Europe as we while in North America is we got this past year, we expect an uptick on coming out of Europe and also the emerging markets, and so the international markets this year. So, we feel pretty good in terms of the momentum that we're getting on that. So, I think you can expect that we'll have further strength from price in revenue management coming in to 2019 and we built that into our guidance.","George Tong","Got it, that's helpful. And on margins, we essentially achieved all your targeted transformation savings and recall cost synergies to the end of 2018. Can you remind us of your 2020 EBITDA margin target taking into account the lease accounting changes and discuss some of the initiatives you have to bridge from your current margins to 2020 margins?","Stuart Brown","Yes, I mean if we normalize for the impact of the lease accounting and even if we go back which to normalize actually for the rev rec accounting that we had that helped us in 2018, while we've been achieving margin expansion of 50 basis points to a 100 basis points a year. Looking forward, right investment benefit also by the obviously the flow through of rev rec as well as synergies, we continue to have cost improvement programs in place that you will continue to see benefit from going forward.","So, we expect to see sort of similar levels of margin expansion going forward. But in addition, we've historically been investing $20 million to $30 million a year in our new business growth and new business initiatives and starting to see some green shoots come out of those businesses. And as you look forward, we expect to see some margin expansion that coming out of those business as well.","So, I think as you look forward, feel quite comfortable with sort of continuing a similar track of a margin expansion.","George Tong","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then the next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Andrew Wittmann","Yes, great. I guess my question kind of builds on the last question here. Just want to understand some of the moving parts of -- I know the long-term guidance to 2020 that you gave. As talked to obviously multi -- your look is going to have lots of puts and takes as things change over the years. But maybe just to start out level side us.","Stuart, can you talk about can you quantify the FX headwind that the target is seeing to revenue and EBITDA, so we could kind of really look on it as on the 2019 currency rates. And I mean it looks like you need to find something like I don\u2019t know exactly what the FX it is but double-digit EPS growth or EBITDA growth into next year in margin increases '20 over '19 of a 200 basis points or so.","So, can you just talk about some on the puts and takes in a little bit more detail and achieving that 2020 guidance and how you feel about the key matrix of revenue and EBITDA specifically?","Stuart Brown","Yes. I'm glad you asked the question. Again, and today we're really focused on the 2019 guidance. So, we didn\u2019t want to sort of confuse that with sort of putting out 2020 numbers. So, let me walk you through the puts and takes to how to get there. And to answer your first question on the currency, if you go back to my script, we talked about in 2019, FX headwinds by itself on revenue were $60 million to $70 million on an EBITDA or $20 million to $25 million.","And --.","Andrew Wittmann","Can you give that cumulative business beginning now just so we can kind of compare more easily, do you have that handy for each one?","Stuart Brown","I don\u2019t have that handy. Again, the exchange rates prior to sort of the recent changes haven\u2019t been that significant, so we go back to what our 2020 plan has been. This is now really the biggest impact. And yes, remember the 2020 plan was built on currency rates at a certain period of time. So, you should, we should always be normalizing for FX when it goes up or down.","Andrew Wittmann","Right.","Stuart Brown","So, but if you look forward and relative to our last 2020 plan, right, you can see that we've delivered right on track for 2018 to get to the 2020 plan adjusted for FX from 2018 reported results, EBITDA would need to grow about 15% or $200 million to get to the range of the 2020 numbers. So, when you think about you got about 4% organic EBITDA growth per year, so that adds in and of itself run a $120 million, continue to expect in our long-term plan, continue to expect a 150, actually a $150 million plus of M&A per year.","So, that $300 million total M&A, that would add about another $50 million of EBITDA and anything about the comments I just made around, we've been investing in new businesses and services about $30 million per year. So, those should start to deliver EBITDA growth as well combined with savings from continuous improvement can get you back into that range for what our longer term models were.","We will, at some point be issuing sort of new long-term growth targets in the future. We're looking at sort of when the best time is to do that now.","William Meaney","And the only thing I would just add Andy on this is that from a FX standpoint is that in our view as we take FX right and the good news is we don\u2019t have a margin exposure on that. So, whether it gives us a tailwind which it did a couple of years ago and now it's giving us headwinds is what your where our shareholders are paying for us to do is to manage the business through those tailwinds and headwinds.","So, we're really focused on line-of-sight to the operational plan that we have to do to deliver that original 2020 guidance and we're well on track with that. And we think the looking at some of the R&D pipeline that Stuart relayed, mentioned the $30 million that we're spending roughly a year on that that includes things like Iron Cloud and InSight which we effectively have seen very little benefit to date on.","So, we feel pretty good in terms of where we stand versus our original outline.","Andrew Wittmann","Great, that's helpful. And then, just kind of a cleanup question here. On the AFFO for the year you guys came in and better how you mentioned. I think it's just some taxes but the thing you control most here is the CapEx side. Is that a delay of some plan to CapEx and that we're going to see in the future or have you been able to manage the business so that the CapEx is altogether and needed?","Stuart Brown","Let me just give you a quick example of one of the big drivers of CapEx improvement. I can't remember if I talked with this on the last call or not. But if you look at that what we spend annually on our fleets for example, a few years ago our operation seemed to do a great job putting in place new management tools for our drivers to improve fuel utilization; reduce wear and tear on the trucks.","As we've gone back now and reevaluated the impact to that, we've realized that the quality of our trucks and the time that they can stay on the road is increased. So, we've been able to actually reduce the rate at which we replace trucks annually and goes around $15 million or $20 million of capital saving in and of itself this year.","Andrew Wittmann","I understand, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P.M.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. My first question, just a quick clarification. Should we still assume the previously stated 2020 plans has not changed, that's right. I know you mentioned new long-term growth targets are coming but you're referring to something past 2020, right?","Stuart Brown","Yes, we will. I mean again, we want to keep those long-term targets out there and if you look at there what we've been talked about in the past in terms of growth rates of a dividend, how do we support that with AFFO and EBITDA, those general trends all remain on track. And we think our current business plan support those.","And the only thing that we'd say, the only thing you need to make sure that you're doing is when you're looking at 2020 is first of all is to make sure that you're looking at the FX impact to that and adjusting those targets for that. We're not issuing 2020 guidance today.","William Meaney","But I make you a point is that the walk that Stuart just took Andy through. Since that we're still on the 2020 number correcting for the 5% at the end of 2020. So, what we expect that the momentum will continue to build in the business. So, exiting '20 we're sitting here at a little over 4% organic EBITDA growth as we sit here today which we think is really great progress because we started as you can find the story as we started less than 2% four or five years ago.","So, we've got that up to a little bit north of 4% on an organic basis and we have lined aside in on track to exit 2020 at 5% organic EBITDA growth.","Stuart Brown","I had one other point as well, just that people don\u2019t think we sort of walking back as on our leverage target as well, right, the original multi-year plan we've got in there either five times lease adjusted EBITDA if we issue the full 80m or 5.2 times target for the end of 2020 and that remains our target as well on our business plan.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you. That's helpful. And just one quick on the datacenter side. You mentioned now that book digits organic revenue growth outlook for 2019. Can you give a quick comment on EBITDA contribution as well?","William Meaney","Go on, I'm sorry.","Unidentified Analyst","EBITDA, on datacenter.","Stuart Brown","Yes. So, I mean the EBITDA on the datacenter, we're sitting right now with the at the mid-40% range on the EBITDA margin. As that scale continues to grow, EBITDA numbers still sort of putting the infrastructure together from an integration standpoint. And also still incurring integration cost, we had a little over $2 million of integration cost in 2018.","So, we're well in track to sort of getting back to the mid-50 margin and a 10% of total EBITDA by the end of 2020.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from MaryAnn Bartels from Merrill Lynch.","MaryAnn Bartels","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted a clarification. So, on the leverage target, you said you would get down about 20 basis points the 5.2 time. So, I'm sorry can you clarify why that's not the five plus five times?","Stuart Brown","So, the 10 basis point to 20 basis points to expansion is or improvement is in 2019 rowed up to the 5.6 at the end of 2019. So, we'll get down to 5.0 -- 5.4 at the end of 2019 and then another improvement in 2020.","William Meaney","And I think to your point about the difference between the 5.2 and the 5.0, it's whether we run the ATM. So, as you know we have a $500 million ATM which we've draw down a little over a 60 million off. So, and we haven\u2019t run that for over a year now. If we ran that, that would reduce the leverage by 0.2, if we don\u2019t run the ATM, then instead of 5.0 it would be 5.2; would be the endpoint for 2020.","MaryAnn Bartels","Got it. And is there a longer term target that you think is ideal for the business but how are we to, so?","Stuart Brown","I think what we've always said is that to us it's not about our ability to run the business or finance the business. And you could see that when we issue debt it's usually at the upper end of investment grade as it stands today. It's more where our covenants cut in. so, our covenants are at 6.5 and we think that ideally we would like 1.5 to 2.0 turns of daylight between wherever our covenants are and where our leverage is.","Because it just gives us much more flexibility, whether it's looking at our own stock from time to time or if it's looking at opportunistic acquisitions, we just think that 1.5 to 2.0 turns between your covenants and where your debt levels are as ideal. So, we're not in a rush, that's why we our view is the right balance again from capital allocation as we continue to invest in growth in the business.","We continue to grow the dividend and that still leaves us enough leftover that we can slowly tick down leverage to the targets that we set for ourselves. And over time that will continue to go down.","MaryAnn Bartels","Great. And then just lastly, in terms of how high you would go for the right datacenter or acquisition or any thoughts on that?","Stuart Brown","Well, it's really hard to talk about hypotheticals. We because look at we really like our plan. Obviously the area where the biggest demand for CapEx, don\u2019t forget we have a 150 million of M&A built into the plan annually and another 250 million plus built in terms of expanding datacenters. So, it's not like we're constraining the business for capital.","So, you put those two together, we got over $400 million that we're ploughing into growth and M&A for the business each year. So, and then if you said that we -- just in datacenter being the one that is probably the most obvious, is we with what we have in terms of Greenfield and sites that we've already started developing is we can take that to over to almost 350 megawatts.","So, we got plenty of daylight in our plans, so it's really hard to respond to a hypothetical at this point.","MaryAnn Bartels","Great. Well, thank you for taking my question.","Stuart Brown","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","Well hi, good morning. I wanted to see if can get a little bit more detail on the assumptions underlying the 1.75% to 2.5% organic storage revenue growth forecast. I think you said in your comments that you think volumes to be flat. Does the low-end of the range accommodate volume declines at all and what do you think is going to be the primary driver of the acceleration from the 1.9 you printed in the fourth quarter to 2.1% at the midpoint?","Stuart Brown","No. Good morning, Karin, this is Stuart. I think if you look at sort of the trends that we had overall, you get some variability from quarter-to-quarter and you got to remember our volume numbers is our trailing four quarters. So, when you get around to the end of the year, you're looking at total volume changes by market is what we put in the supplemental and you also then can come back into sort of implied price.","If you look at sort of the buildup in the number and you look at developed markets and emerging markets both volume and pricing, actually don\u2019t expect to see that much difference in trends in 2019 from 2018. So, we've talked about revenue management and our ups continue to upside in that program. And if you think about sort of what those are, it's not really pricing consistent with inflations, so we're not out there doing anything too crazy on that front.","You will get some tick down from organic revenue growth in the data management business; we talked about that as well. And then, that will be offset by continued growth in the datacenter in the adjacent businesses where you're getting storage and service growth on both of those. Albeit in 2019, the data center cooler base or organic base will grow as the acquisition sort of move in to as we lap over the acquisition dates.","So, I think very comfortable with the growth rates that we've put out there.","Karin Ford","Thanks. Second question is where are EBITDA multiples on business acquisitions today and where are cap rates on real-estate acquisitions today?","Stuart Brown","We haven\u2019t really done a lot of real-estate acquisitions today in that sense. I mean, the real-estate purchases that we've done are really opportunistic and it's more we've done some -- we will do some real-estate acquisitions in 2019 where we've got a couple of purchase options. Actually in California in a couple of record center that are well below market and that's in our plan will fund that with capital recycling from selling some other real-estate which is also in our plan.","So, we'll continue to recycle capital opportunistically. If you look at sort of where multiples are creating in the business from a multiple of revenue basis and again we try to look at it actually including integration cost and things like that and we're still sitting sort of 3% to 3.5% shred, actually quite a bit little bit cheaper than that. And as a multiple of EBITDA six to seven times EBITDA and that's pre-synergies.","So, our synergies will add another turn or so improvement on to those numbers.","Karin Ford","On the capital recycling front, what's the spread do you think between dispositions and acquisitions this year?","Stuart Brown","As we talked about in the past sort of in the -- the spreads are -- you'll see the gains, we saw the gains actually that we recorded in the P&L in the fourth quarter from some real-estate sales. And we'll you'll see some nice numbers next year as well. I mean, cap rates on industrial real-estate and we did some evaluation work with the east still last year.","You look at the real-estate portfolio that we own in just North America is for the excluding racking before racking is about $2.5 billion and that's on a six cap rate. I'd argue cap rates are actually probably below that given the markets that we're in. and we would primarily end-markets like Boston, New Jersey, California, Chicago, Dallas, we really try to own in the primary markets.","And you'll actually see a selling, actually the real-estate we're going to sell or recycle is going to be more the secondary and tertiary markets.","Karin Ford","Great. And then, just last question just a technical one on Page 7 of the slides. You show that the growth portfolio moves from about 19% of the revenue mix to 25% from the third quarter and fourth quarter. Was it just a reclassification or why that number moves so much?","Stuart Brown","That's more of a pro-forma just because we're lapping the IO EvoSwitch in Credit Suisse datacenter acquisitions. So, we were quite busy in 2018 and if you actually once those are all lapped, we're sitting at a 75\/25 mix today.","Karin Ford","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question is a follow-up from Nate Crossett with Berenberg.","Nathan Crossett","Hi. I just wanted to ask about investment grade potential. I'm just curious to hear about any in our recent conversations with the rating agencies and how they are viewing the data center build out. And the reason I asked is because DLR has similar leverage levels and they have investment grades.","So, --.","Stuart Brown","You just say that to make me jealous, don\u2019t you Nate?","Nathan Crossett","No. just give me a sense -- I feel like, good.","Stuart Brown","No, it's I can look at a number of my peers across the REIT sector they have similar leverage levels and in better ratings that we do. We've been having ongoing discussions with both S&P and Moody's in a very healthy way, as our business had shifted from historically business services we became a REIT. We're continuing grow the datacenter business.","I think Moody's actually has put out a report and published that we've moved over to their REIT team and so I think we're making good progress, we're having great dialogue with them. And I think they over time will give us more credit for the REIT like durability of the cash flow that comes out of the business.","William Meaney","And the only thing I would just add to that to Nate is that we've done like totally -- we're both focused that we would love to be treated like digital. The other part for us is we still want to de-lever because of this free space that we have where our covenants, our covenants are set at 6.5 why that's historical but that is what it is.","One thing I would say is we're already getting kind of upper end of investment grade pricing when we go out and issue debt. So, we're already getting the benefit, it's just that rating agency is just all rated that way. So, you actually see our debt get priced is we're not far off but it would be nice to have the rating as well.","Stuart Brown","Yes. Our debt investors give us credit for the strength in the balance sheet and cash flow.","Nathan Crossett","That's helpful, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question also is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Yes, I was wondering given your storage locations in North America are close to many major metropolitan areas and you have the trucking and logistics expertise. I'm wondering if there is a way to capture some additional demand for your storage base from last mile demand or is that what flex the industrial company that you've referenced before, is that kind of a last mile offering?","William Meaney","That's a great question, Sheila. So, it's kind of I would say three things that and I kind of highlighted it and will try to incorporate that so the people can see the total volume that we're storing rather than just purely the records information; the 690 million cubic feet of records that we are storing, doesn't include these things that we're already doing like under the flex program which is exactly which has similar margins by the way or revenue per square foot as our core business.","We also have a similar type of operation in Amsterdam where we're doing both last mile customs and delivery for a number of the large global e-commerce platform just well as local post European postal offices. And the third area which I also alluded to is and we've talked about a few times is that we continue to like certain aspects of the Wallet consumer storage which is a logistics heavy portion of the consumer storage market.","So, we think those three areas are areas that will continue to add volume to our network. And we our intention is to be able to incorporate that in the number, so you see it because right now it's hard to actually see the level of impact.","Stuart Brown","The thing I'll just add on quickly to, and when you think about how do we leverage our real-estate and locations, our logistics know how our asset tracking. And you can really see it in our Art business as well and entertainment services where we're doing a lot of specialized transport packing tracking of unique items and a number of the major auction houses have outsourced their back office to us for us to handle that for them.","So, how do we keep expanding that and growing that, we think that's an interesting area.","Sheila McGrath","Great. And if you could quickly comment on the pre-leased development pipeline and datacenters moved up especially in New Jersey, just comment on the leasing activity there?","Stuart Brown","Yes. Now, let me again, we had a strong fourth quarter leasing activity. We're a little over a 20% pre-leased in the development pipeline. And as Bill mentioned, we had a large global bank take additional space at that location and we continue to see good leasing pipeline in almost all of our markets.","Sheila McGrath","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Yugo Weiwei [ph] with JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on that investment rate question that was just asked. As on the financial policy perspective, do you want to be investment grade or are you working towards becoming an investment creative company?","William Leo Meaney","What I would tell you is that unfortunately I don't control the ratings. The rating agencies do. I mean we want to operate the business a heading in a direction that we think is prudent for us to be able to continue to grow and run the business. But I wouldn't say that there's something that we're aspire to. We want to keep those types of metrics, but it'll be up to the rating agency to figure out what they do.","Unidentified Analyst","So from the company's perspective respective of what the rating agency says you're sort of not managing the balance sheet to become of investment grade. You want to remain in high yield.","William Leo Meaney","I think yes, I would say we want to manage our balance sheet consistent with they being able to fund a business and not that different than other REITs and if you look at their balance sheet structure I think we're pretty close to that today.","Unidentified Analyst","And then sort of the lease versus owned mix, are the agencies I think in the past have had an issue with that as a way to compare to other REITs lease versus owned is that still an issue from their perspective or have they moved on?","William Leo Meaney","I would say first of all, let me refer you back I think it was the May REIT presentation that's on our website from last fall where we disclosed some of the valuation of our real estate in a little bit more detail. We've done that a couple of times and obviously we shared that with the rating agencies as well and so there's some detail in there. The important point here is that you have to look at it on a percentage of value versus a percentage of square feet.","So while it looks like we own 30% of our overall square feet if you look at it from a valuation perspective the markets that we own or the markets you want to be in and control real estate so from a valuation perspective we're over 50%.","Unidentified Analyst","And are the agencies come around to that way of thinking you think? ","William Leo Meaney","I think the Moody's changing the ratings team is maybe a sign of that.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you very much. That's all I had.","William Leo Meaney","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa Marsden. You may begin.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And this morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and strategic initiatives, followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. Rod Day, acting CFO, and Stephen Golden, VP, IR, are also with us today. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2 of that presentation, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2013 and 2014 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures as required by Reg G can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Meaney.","William L. Meaney","Thanks, Melissa, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we begin, I wish to congratulate the Red Sox. Sorry for those of you that aren't fans, better luck next year. It was a great season and a great win. I couldn't ask for more after being out of the country for 27 years and coming back home to see the Sox win the World Series. So let's just hope that the other Boston teams do as well this year.","Now back to business. During the third quarter, we continued to work on advancing our strategy by sustaining the durability of our business through attractive core acquisitions and supporting the long-term growth through expansion into fast-growing emerging markets and selective investment in emerging businesses. Our financial results were in line with our expectations, with a total revenue of $756 million, adjusted OIBDA of $240 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.31 per share. We did incur some costs related to the implementation of our strategy, although our underlying performance remains solid and consistent with the recent trends. I'll cover these charges at a high level, and then Brian will have more on how they impact our outlook, as well as the impact from recent acquisitions on our guidance for the remainder of 2013.","The changes we -- the charges we took in the third quarter and expect to take in the fourth quarter relate to some realignment within our organizational structure, with a view towards speed and simplicity. These changes will help fuel our growth strategy by consolidating activities, both within and across units, thereby eliminating duplication, increasing spans and reducing layers throughout the organization. Additionally, these changes will reduce operating costs to mitigate anticipated core service revenue declines and cost inflation, and will provide the financial resources for investment in new areas that are adjacent to our core activities. We also booked early debt extinguishment charges related to our successful August refinancing activities, which we undertook to align our capital structure with our long-term strategy in order to both lower our cost of capital and extend maturity. This was a tremendous accomplishment, particularly as our treasury team was amending and upsizing our senior credit facility at the same time.","Setting aside the charges for a moment, it was a good quarter, which we continued to build on the core strengths of our organization and enhance our platform for long-term growth and sustainable returns. And we continued to make good progress with initiatives that support each of the 3 main pillars of our strategic priority. As a reminder, those priorities are: driving continued profitability growth in our mature markets; further penetration in the emerging markets; and identifying, incubating and scaling emerging businesses.","Earlier this month, we gathered the senior leadership of the company to sharpen our focus on the strategic priorities that will drive our business in the future and to ensure that our plans for execution are closely aligned with those priorities. We have more detail -- we will have more detail on the specific initiatives at our Investor Day in March. And as we refine our execution plans, we will continue to pursue opportunities that align with the 3 pillars I just described.","For example, you saw our announcement a couple of weeks ago about our acquisition of Cornerstone Records Management for a total consideration of USD 191 million. Cornerstone has a good business, with storage representing more than 60% of its revenues, and a strong presence amongst small and mid-sized customers in the U.S. We expect the transaction to yield attractive fold-in economics, with ROIC of the 10% plus range, above our cost of capital, which translates into mid-teens equity returns. We do expect to incur some incremental capital and move costs as we realize real estate synergies over time. And OIBDA from this transaction should reach USD 30 million on a fully integrated basis.","We were also active with acquisitions in the international markets during the quarter. In August, we announced the acquisition of the Colombian records management and data protection business of G4S, the market leader in Colombia, for USD 54 million. The acquisition represents our entry into Colombia, one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, and is consistent with our objective to grow our presence and achieve market leadership in attractive emerging markets. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of File Service in Peru, valued at USD 16 million, which advances us to the leading position in that country as well. These transactions offer the potential for future benefits as we integrate them into our existing Latin American business, which includes operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico.","Also during the quarter, we acquired a small data protection business in France. In total, we have completed acquisitions totaling approximately USD 320 million thus far in 2013, with roughly $220 million of that in the mature markets of the U.S., France, and $100 million in emerging markets. Growing our presence in emerging markets is an important part of our long-term growth strategy, as constant dollar revenue growth in emerging markets during Q3 was 23%, with 15% internal growth.","In addition, we continue to evaluate the potential of emerging businesses, with data centers representing our most significant investment to date. During the quarter, we broke ground on our first regional data center in Northborough, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, at our existing campus for record storage. This data center is being built to satisfy stringent security and compliance requirements that we believe will be attractive to many highly regulated organizations in industries such as health care, biotech and financial services. We are making good progress with building our base from which to scale this business. And in total, we expect to invest roughly USD 40 million in the data center business in 2014.","As we were considering frameworks for enhancing our focus on emerging adjacent businesses, we noticed a common construct and best practice amongst leading innovative companies. To help support leaders with launching and running their new businesses, they typically appoint senior, seasoned executives to lead these efforts. In keeping with that best practice, we are creating a new executive position with Harry Ebbighausen, who's currently President of North America, taking on formal responsibility for emerging businesses effective the beginning of next year. Harry has the track record and respect within the organization to champion these efforts and make sure we are leveraging our resources and capabilities wherever possible. We are splitting Harry's current role into 2 areas: 1 focused on physical records management and another focused on data protection and recovery. This separation of roles will align responsibilities with our growth strategy and provide more discrete focus on product lines.","John Tomovcsik, or JT, will take on responsibility for records management, DMS and shred for North America. JT, currently Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for North America, has been with the company for more than 27 years in various operations and sales roles, spanning multiple product lines. He also leads North American operations as one of the primary leaders behind the group's continuous improvement model, which drove significant profitability increases between 2007 and 2010. In addition to this focus around product lines, we will be leveraging our global capabilities in a more coordinated way, in areas such as product management marketing, for example, with the goal of maintaining continuity and exploiting our global scale and knowledge whilst operating more efficiently. We may have further realignment of our organization as we continue to refine our execution plan. We'll have more color on this in March.","Turning now to our progress with preparations for REIT conversion. We successfully completed the integration of REIT-critical IT systems on July 1. We are continuing the internal work necessary to ensure compliance with the REIT tests, even if we don't have final written rulings from the IRS on our outstanding PLRs, or private letter rulings, prior to January 1. However, we won't be disclosing REIT-related metrics or reporting externally as a REIT until such time as the IRS's final decision is rendered.","As I noted on last quarter's call, we aren't providing interim updates as we move through the process with the IRS. As most of you are aware, we have several PLRs in the queue. To the extent that we were to receive verbal indications of rulings throughout the normal give-and-take review process on some of these PLRs, it could be misinterpreted if we were to disclose partial information prior to having formal confirmation from the IRS on all matters necessary to convert. Although we don't yet have clarity on our outstanding PLRs, we plan to move forward with our plans to convert.","The REIT structure does not impact our strategy or execution plan. It simply enhances returns. Our strategy is focused on sustaining the durability of the business, maximizing free cash flow and supporting attractive stockholder returns, regardless of whether or not we ultimately convert to a REIT. Our free cash flow before discretionary investments, which we define as M&A, real estate, emerging businesses and dividends, is roughly USD 300 million to USD 340 million, based on our anticipated CapEx included in 2014 guidance, which includes about USD 50 million of CapEx related to acquisition integration and consolidation of facilities in Latin America in order to drive additional synergies.","With regard to discretionary spending, we have a pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, as demonstrated by our recent transactions in both mature and emerging markets. Generally, these transactions are accretive fairly quickly due to our ability to integrate them into our existing infrastructure and consolidate facilities. We also have opportunities to invest in emerging businesses, similar to the way we are growing our data center business. As always, all our investments are made through a clear capital allocation approach to deliver long-term sustainable returns to shareholders. With respect to new adjacent businesses, we will start small with some interesting new opportunities, assess them, and either scale them or scrap them.","Further, to our capital allocation approach, we know some of you have questions about what our dividend level and\/or share repurchase program might look as a C-Corp. I would just like to reiterate that we are committed to enhancing shareholder payouts and will strive for a dividend level and\/or share repurchases that allow for consistent growth over the long term, in line with growth in the free cash flow of the business, whilst allowing the flexibility to pursue high-return investments that support growth.","Again, Brian will have more details, but with regard to our preliminary view on 2014, we are projecting solid constant dollar revenue growth of 2% to 4% and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA growth of 2% to 5%, consistent with the long-term goals we've referenced to in the past. Our guidance incorporates any efficiency benefits from our organizational realignment. As I noted earlier, some of this will help offset pressure from expected continued declines in core service activity, while some will be reinvested to advance our strategy, which we believe yield attractive returns in excess of our hurdle rates. Moreover, in the future, you can expect that we will engage in the organization a continuous improvement approach focused on enhancing profitability to offset headwinds in the service side of the business, provide for some profit growth and provide resources for investment in future growth.","Before I turn over the call, I want to sincerely thank Brian for his contributions as CFO over the last 6.5 years. He's added a great deal of value for both the company and our investors, and he will be missed. Brian is not just a great professional, but he's been a great colleague, and I am truly thankful for his help with my transition over the past year. Brian is moving to a new opportunity at the beginning of next year and we wish him all the best. He'll be working with us through the end of the year to transition the role.","I wish also to introduce Rod Day, currently CFO of International, who has been with us for 5 years. Rod is very knowledgeable about our operations and emerging market strategy. He was instrumental in driving the 700 basis points of profit improvement achieved in our International business over a 3-year period, and achieving this against a backdrop where he helped add a number of new emerging markets to the portfolio. He's been a good steward of capital, having allocated resources amongst numerous international markets whilst deploying more than USD 0.5 billion for acquisitions and capital expenditures during that same period. He has also been involved from the start with the changes we need to make our International business, to ensure compliance with REIT tests. We'll be in good hands with Rod as the acting CFO of the enterprise while we consider both internal and external candidates.","In summary, we had a solid quarter punctuated by several major accomplishments related to the execution of our plan and further progress towards REIT preparedness, including alignment of our capital structure. We are making some changes to the organization to support our strategy and speed of execution. And we believe our plan sets us up well to sustain the durability of the business and support long-term growth. Additionally, our outlook for 2014 is solid and in line with our expectations for the business. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Bill. Given that we've got a lot to cover today, including our preliminary outlook for 2014, we moved a few of our regular year-to-date slides to the appendix for your reference.","Let's turn now to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid results in Q3, reflecting strong operating performance supported by consistent storage rental growth, International profit gains, as well as benefits from recent acquisitions. Storage rental grew 4% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by consistent 2% gains in North America and 10% growth in International, including benefits from recent acquisitions in Latin America and North America. Adjusted OIBDA performance was in line with expectations in Q3, driven by continued International margin gains and sustained cost controls.","As we deliver solid operating performance, we continue to advance our strategic plan, supported by core acquisitions and investments in our data center offerings and capabilities. These investments are intended to sustain the durability of our core business and provide a platform for future revenue and profit growth. For the full year 2013, the core business is on track to achieve its financial goals.","Today, we're updating our 2013 outlook to reflect recently completed acquisitions, including Cornerstone, and the impact of the restructuring charges of about $30 million we expect to record in 2013. Looking ahead to 2014, we expect constant dollar growth of 2% to 4% in revenues and 2% to 5% in adjusted OIBDA, supported by continued strong operating performance and the benefits of our 2013 acquisitions. Although we continue to pursue REIT conversion effective January 1, 2014, our preliminary 2014 outlook assumes C-Corp reporting.","Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2012. Q3 results were in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. Enterprise revenues grew 2.2% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continued to produce strong results. International posted 7% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 10% storage rental growth, including benefits from our recent acquisitions in Colombia and Peru. North America posted flat constant dollar revenue growth as 2% storage rental gains were offset by lower complementary service revenues. FX rate changes reduced revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points in the quarter.","Adjusted OIBDA was $240 million, up 0.4%, excluding the $5 million restructuring charge. A key driver of profit performance was the continued improvement in our International segment, consistent with our plans. International adjusted OIBDA increased 18% year-on-year in Q3, reflecting strong top line growth and continued margin gains. Year-to-date, our International adjusted OIBDA margin is 25%, in line with our 3-year improvement plan to increase International margins by 700 basis points. We expect the underlying margin to exceed 25% for the full year, though the reported numbers will be slightly lower due to the impacts of recently completed acquisitions and related integration costs.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per share, compared to $0.34 in Q3 2012. The year-on-year decrease was due primarily to 19 million additional shares outstanding, including those issued as part of our special dividend last November. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, which reduced reported EPS by $0.08 per share net of tax. GAAP earnings per share of $0.03 included $21 million of REIT cost and $46 million of other expense, including $44 million of early debt extinguishment charges in connection with our Q3 refinancing activities. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 38%.","Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q3 growth rates showed some improvement compared to last quarter and were in line with our full year outlook. For the quarter, consistent storage rental growth of 3.6% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance. Year-on-year global net volume growth was 3.2%, including a 2.2% benefit from our 2013 acquisitions. North America posted 1.6% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat records management volume, pricing of 1.3% and the benefits from our recent acquisitions. North American pricing gains were consistent in Q2 (sic) [Q3] reflecting impacts from prior year comparisons. For the full year, we expect pricing gains to be approximately 1.5%.","International storage rental growth was 9.5% in constant dollar for the quarter, reflecting 24% growth in emerging markets, supported by strong organic gains and benefits from acquisitions. Internal storage rental growth remained strong in International, with a 6.5% gain in the quarter. For the year, we expect overall storage rental growth to grow about 4% on a constant dollar basis.","Total services were flat on a constant dollar basis in Q3, as International service growth, supported by acquisitions, was offset by North American service declines driven by lower complementary service revenues. Higher incoming volumes and related transportation revenues helped to offset these impacts in the quarter. Average paper prices declined 19% year-on-year, resulting in $3 million less revenue in Q3, compared to the last year. At current paper prices levels, which are down about 15% versus the 2012 average, we will see some pressure on this front moving forward, which will constrain overall service gains. Overall, total internal growth was 1%, as 2.3% gains in storage rental more than offset modest service declines.","Let's move now to Slide 6 and review our 2013 acquisitions in more detail. As you know, acquisitions are an important tool we use to execute key components of our stated business strategy to drive continued profitable growth in our mature markets and to further penetrate attractive emerging markets. To date in 2013, we've completed 6 core acquisitions for a total consideration of approximately $320 million. This includes our most recent acquisition of Cornerstone Records Management here in the U.S. for approximately $190 million. Excluding Cornerstone, which was a unique opportunity, we spent approximately $130 million on core acquisitions so far this year. This aligns with our projected average annual deployment of $50 million to $150 million presented at Investor Day last October. In the mature markets, the goal is to optimize the storage network we've built through fold-in acquisitions and extend the durability of these high-return businesses.","Although Cornerstone is certainly larger than the typical business we're likely to acquire, the fold-in economics of this transaction are attractive and will support future revenue and profit growth. Post acquisition, we generally realize the benefits of operating efficiencies within the first year or so. Benefits derived from rationalizing the real estate portfolio in an acquisition may take up to several years, depending on the size of the business, lease expiration dates and the volume that needs to be moved. All of this is factored into our valuation models as we make our investment decisions.","We continue to acquire businesses in high-growth emerging markets to build market leadership and position ourselves to capture the first-time outsourcing wave taking place in these countries. In June, we acquired Archivum in Brazil, building on last year's acquisition of Grupo Store. In September, we acquired File Service, the leading records management company in Peru, and entered a new market with the acquisition of the records management division of G4S in Colombia. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we'll continue to evaluate these opportunities through a disciplined capital allocation and ROIC lens, ensuring we create value for our shareholders.","Let's now turn to Slide 7 to look at our balance sheet metrics. As previously announced, we completed several financing transactions that sustained our sound balance sheet. First, we amended our senior credit facility, upsizing it to $1.5 billion with a syndicate of 21 banks. The new facility is composed entirely of a revolving credit facility with no term loans. Pricing under the credit facility didn't change as a result of this amendment and is based on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on certain financial ratios.","We also took advantage of attractive market opportunities to lower the cost of our fixed debt and extend maturities by issuing $600 million of 6% senior notes due 2023 in the U.S. and $20 million of 6 1\/8% senior Canadian dollar notes due in 2021. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to redeem all our 8% senior subordinated notes due 2018 and 2020, to redeem our outstanding 7 1\/2% Canadian dollar senior sub notes due in 2017 and to fund a cash tender for $138 million of our 8 3\/8% senior sub notes due in 2021.","Through the amendment to our credit agreement, we changed our consolidated leverage ratio for compliance purposes to a lease-adjusted consolidated leverage ratio, which is an EBITDAR-based calculation that adds leases to our total debt. This better aligns with how rating agencies view our leverage and recognizes that leases are a form of financing. At the end of Q3, that ratio was 4.9x, with a requirement not to exceed 6.5x. This compares to 4.2x calculated under the prior credit agreement, which excluded the impact of leases from the calculation and had a requirement not to exceed 5.5x. To align with this new calculation, we're establishing a target lease-adjusted consolidated leverage range of 4 to 5x. This equates to our previous range of 3 to 4x excluding lease financing.","As I just indicated, we're currently operating with a net total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 4.9x, which is just below the high end of our targeted 4 to 5x range. Our leverage ratio has increased over the past 2-plus years as planned, to support shareholder payouts of $1.7 billion, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. The costs associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily push our leverage to or just above the high end of our range.","We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $1.1 billion, with $172 million in cash and $975 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. Year-to-date, we paid $155 million in cash dividends and $130 million of REIT costs, including REIT-related CapEx and tax payments related to depreciation recapture. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders and we remain well positioned to fund our business plan.","That concludes a review of the Q3 2013 results. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our 2014 outlook -- or excuse me, our 2013 outlook. Slide 8 summarizes our updated 2013 operating outlook. As I mentioned earlier, our business trends and operating fundamentals are consistent and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2013. Today, we're upgrading our full year 2013 guidance to reflect recently completed acquisitions, including Cornerstone, and the $30 million of restructuring charges Bill discussed in his comments. For ease of discussion, we're presenting our updated outlook for the underlying business excluding the $30 million of restructuring charges separately, and then layering in the charges to show their impact on our expected reported results.","We're now expecting full year revenues to be between $3,025,000,000 and $3,050,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA ex restructuring to be between $905 million and $925 million. Our expectations for adjusted EPS, CapEx and free cash flow remain basically the same as last quarter, with the exception of $5 million of data center spending that will now take place in 2014. The impact of the restructuring charge will be to reduce adjusted OIBDA by $30 million, adjust EPS by $0.10 per share and free cash flow by $18 million.","As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant one-time operating capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline and several of our REIT-critical systems are now operating on a test basis. For the year, we expect to incur between $65 million and $95 million of incremental expense. The impact of these costs will be a reduction in reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36. These costs are tracking consistently with previously disclosed estimates of total conversion costs. Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the REIT-related items, are included in the appendix.","Let's move now to Slide 9 to begin our review of the preliminary 2014 outlook. Slide 9 highlights key factors supporting our preliminary outlook for 2014 performance. First, let me remind you that we continue to -- although we continue to pursue REIT conversion, our preliminary 2014 outlook assumes C-Corp reporting. As such, there are approximately $10 million to $15 million of ongoing REIT compliance costs that are not included in our operating forecast for 2014. These costs are currently being categorized as REIT costs and being reported separately. If and when we successfully convert to a REIT, we'll update our guidance accordingly.","As noted earlier, our outlook is for 2% to 4% constant dollar revenue growth and 2% to 5% constant dollar adjusted OIBDA growth in 2014, supported by sustained performance in North America, solid revenue profit growth in our International segment and benefits from our 2013 acquisitions. We expect to realize $30 million to $40 million in annual cost savings from our restructuring plan. These savings will offset cost inflation and pressure from continuing service activity declines and fund investments to support our growth strategy. Our International business, excluding the impact of acquisitions and their related integration costs, will continue to accrete margin of about 50 basis points next year, building on the 700 basis point improvement we achieved over the last 3 years. Assuming FX rates remain at recent levels, foreign exchange will not have a material impact on our reported growth rates in 2014.","The 6 core acquisitions completed to date in 2013 will build on sustained operating performance and set a solid foundation for future revenue and profit growth, consistent with our long-term strategy.","Overall, we expect these completed transactions to add 2.5 percentage points to our constant dollar revenue growth in 2014, along with $20 million to $25 million of incremental adjusted OIBDA after initial integration costs. Additional efficiency and operating gains will be realized over time as our real estate consolidation plans are implemented for these businesses. Our CapEx and free cash flow will be impacted by our recent acquisitions and investments in our data centers. We targeted nearly $40 million of CapEx for acquisitions, primarily Cornerstone, and about $10 million to support real estate consolidations, especially in Brazil and Argentina. These investments will drive future profit growth. We also expect to about -- to invest about $40 million in data center build-outs, including our first aboveground facility in Massachusetts.","Let's turn to Slide 10 to summarize our 2014 outlook. Again, on a constant dollar basis, we're targeting 2% to 4% revenue growth and 2% to 5% adjusted OIBDA growth. On a reported basis, this outlook supports our preliminary revenue guidance of between $3,090,000,000 and $3,170,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA of $930 million to $960 million. Our outlook for adjusted EPS is to remain in the range of $1.03 to $1.14 per share, as adjusted OIBDA gains are offset by higher depreciation and amortization and increased interest expense. Our adjusted EPS calculation assumes 193 million shares outstanding and a structural tax rate of $39 million -- of 39%.","Our outlook is for consistent underlying free cash flow to reflect solid operating performance and consistent trends. The year-on-year decrease in expected free cash flow is primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $245 million for the year, driven by approximately $50 million in acquisition integration and real estate consolidations designed to drive future profit gains. This outlook for 2014 is preliminary and is based on current FX rates, paper prices and shares outstanding, any or all of which can change materially in short periods of time. We'll update our outlook again on our Q4 earnings call to reflect changes, if any, in these variables. A slide laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA is included in the appendix.","That concludes our review. In summary, Q3 was a quarter of solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our 2013 financial goals. We continue to execute against our business plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. We continue to advance work in connection with the REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders. Thank you, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I want to get a sense for what your outlook is for organic storage volume trends in North America. How much has your sales force verticalization and sales and marketing investments contributed to capping the un-vended storage opportunity?","William L. Meaney","George, it's Bill. I think right now we're still seeing continued traction on the verticalization, but again, as I said last time, it's still early days because we stood up a number of the verticals. I think right now, in terms of volume growth, is we're flat, trying to trend upward in some of the markets that we've applied it to. But I think in terms of revenue, we're still seeing the 1%, 1.5% revenue growth, if we look at the North American business.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And within International storage, can you talk about whether you're maintaining share in the countries where you have a leadership position and what your progress is in taking non-leadership countries to leadership positions?","William L. Meaney","Well, I think on that, we're actually gaining share in the markets where we have leadership positions and we're, in some countries where we've been at it longer than others, in spots in South America, for instance, we're mimicking margins that we see in North America, in the most mature markets. So that's progressing very well. I think that the -- overall, I think if you look at the countries, Peru, we did an acquisition which puts us into a strong leadership position now in Peru this year. Last year, through our acquisitions in Brazil, we achieved a market position, but we've done now an even more recent acquisition in Brazil, which furthers the distance between ourselves and our next competitor. So I think with the targeted acquisitions we've done is we've continued to build market-leading positions. So if we kind of look at in Latin America right now, in Chile, Brazil, Peru and Colombia, because the acquisition we did in Colombia was already in a leading or pole position in that market, we have clear market-leading positions in all those countries.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful. And can you talk a bit about the progress you're making and additional color in scaling your wholesale data center business and any other diversifying growth initiatives you have beyond wholesale data centers?","William L. Meaney","It's too early for us to comment on it. We have a pipeline in the emerging business, which Harry is now taking over. And there's a number of things that are building up in that pipeline, and we're screening those to figure out which ones will go to the testing phase. And as I said, we'll test, and then based on those tests, we'll either drop or we'll scale. So we're in the process of that. In terms of the wholesale data center space, we are making some real progress. And in fact, we're starting to see more and more synergies between the wholesale data space and our data protection business, because many customers like the continuity in terms of what we can do for them vis-\u00e0-vis their tiered archiving strategy, so it's more of a continuous product. So again, early days, but that's why we were encouraged to go ahead to start the construction of the aboveground facility in Northborough, Massachusetts.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then last question, excluding special charges this quarter, OIBDA was -- margins were flat from the prior year. What are the drivers for continued margin upside? Any specifics you have, especially on the International front?","William L. Meaney","I think on the International front, I think Brian highlighted, and he can go into more specifics, is a modest gain. But I think again, I think I said this last time on the call, you need to think about International as a portfolio play. And that's why I highlighted in my remarks that Rod, with his leadership in International, achieved 700 basis points whilst adding a number of emerging markets. Because when we buy these emerging market plays, it takes us a while to get them to the margins that we get as we fold in and rationalize the real estate. And so our view is that if you start seeing a major ramp-up in the overall International margin, it's saying that we're not finding places that are good opportunities to start building market-leading positions in other geographies. So next year, I think Brian highlighted it, it's a fairly modest improvement in terms of our OIBDA margin on International. It's not saying that the business isn't growing in value. It's just saying that we see an acquisition pipeline, which it takes time to actually bring those things up, both to a market-leading position, and to actually consolidate the operations so that we start mimicking the margins. So we have countries in South America that, as I say, are at the same or actually even slightly higher margin than the United States. And we have others that are further back on the development curve that are growing. So it is really a portfolio play.","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, that's exactly right. I think in North America, we're trying to sustain very high returns, where we have, in 2\/3 of our portfolio internationally, where we have leadership and very good returns, we're trying to sustain those as well and drive additional margin improvement overall as we continue to scale out the International portfolio and control our overhead costs in corporate and drive efficiencies that enable us to reinvest selectively against new growth opportunities. So in balance, right now, we're in a zone where our profit is projected to grow at or slightly above our revenue growth rate. And I think over time, as we continue to be successful advancing growth opportunities, I think that will give us greater chance to kind of leverage our cost base and produce some margin gains.","William L. Meaney","Yes. And one thing on that, just to add to Brian's comment, is the thing you should keep in mind, that we're always doing these things above our hurdle rate. So yes, we want to actually make even higher returns on equity, but these acquisitions that we're doing in these emerging markets typically are plus-20% return on equity and have very attractive, obviously then, returns on invested capital. But as they grow, then of course, the returns grow even more.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Bill, I want ask you a little more about Cornerstone. The acquisition, is this, would you say, more of a real estate consolidation play? Or is this more of a play where you have a much better entree into this mid-market, where you guys typically haven't played that much?","William L. Meaney","Good question, Shlomo. It's both. I think that, first of all, to your first question on the real estate side, the reason why the returns look so attractive, as we say, it's mid-teens in terms of return on equity and 10%-plus return on invested capital, is going to your real estate question. It's almost like a pickup and move because there's such an overlap in terms of their real estate and ours. So it takes a little while because I think some of the leases go out to 5 years, where we won't be able to consolidate the real estate overnight. But we're going to be able to consolidate a lot of it fairly quickly. So it is, to your point, a real estate operations consolidation move, is what's in our acquisition model driving the value, first and foremost. So that's what we based our modeling on and that's what we're banking the returns on. So it's something that we're very comfortable with. I think the potential upside to outperform, that's very difficult to quantify. Is your comment about their presence on the middle market? In some of the organizational changes I alluded to is also helping us get at that. So we are looking to get some D&A from Cornerstone and doing -- being more aggressive in the middle market, where we may not have been as present in the past. And we think there's some interesting opportunities there.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Do you think you're going to need to stand up a separate sales organization? Because I mean, typically the typical account that they went after has really, has a different parameter than the kind of national or even international accounts that you typically go after.","William L. Meaney","Shlomo, I'd rather get into that on Investor Day in March because -- I'm not trying to be coy, but the announcement that we've made in terms of the reorganization of the alignment and restructuring that we're taking is going -- part of that is addressing your question. And as you can probably appreciate, we're in the process of communicating that throughout the organization. So I don't want to really get ahead of myself in terms of our announcements internally. But part of our restructuring is to actually address the question that you're asking.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'll move on from there. I appreciate that. The core service decline was kind of the lowest we've seen since 1Q '12. Just from what you guys talked about in terms of expectation that service to continue to weigh, do I assume that you guys view this as an anomaly as opposed to a bottoming?","Brian P. McKeon","I think there are similarities in the trend, Shlomo. We are seeing benefit as we're acquiring businesses and integrating them. The related transportation activity and things of that nature, there's a benefit that flows through core service. We are seeing some leveling of the service trends. I don't want to make too much of that at this stage, but I think some of the flattening we're beginning to see, it's still down, and we're still anticipating a level of pressure there. And we also just have some more favorable compares year-on-year. We worked through some of the tougher comparison areas, like our Shredding business in International. So on balance, it's somewhat better and we've got some discrete things that are helping us, but I would reinforce, we still expect to have a level of pressure on just the really, the key impact of technology, which is not on our storage business, but more on how paper records are used in business operations. We do anticipate some level of pressure going forward.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then Brian, maybe you could just walk us through the difference between the OIBDA and the free cash flow this year and the OIBDA and the free cash flow of next year. I mean, how much of it is the difference of interest expense? And how much of it are relating to some of the other efforts that you guys have, maybe in data center and some of the other things?","Brian P. McKeon","It's principally capital. So if you took our numbers next year, Shlomo, we try to highlight that there's roughly $50 million of investment in integrating the acquisitions, as well as including some discrete investments we're making in Latin America to capture -- to get more efficient real estate operations. If you adjust it for that $50 million number, I think you basically see very similar trends year-on-year in adjusted OIBDA. We'll have somewhat -- we have low cash taxes this year, driven by the timing of some payments. But next year, that will be more normalized as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry, I can't resist. I'm going to ask another core service question, if that's okay. So in the quarter, there's language in the press release that says new incoming volume related to transportation. So could you just be specific? You definitely have been very clear that there's a long-term trend to less retrievals, but in the third quarter, was there some recovery in that retrieval piece? And then looking at 2014, do you feel like core service internally could be flattish?","Brian P. McKeon","Andrew, it's add lots [ph] is where we're seeing some benefit. There is some acquisition benefit as well. But the add lots [ph], it's an area of focus in terms of selling force effectiveness, growth in international markets. We're seeing -- we saw better trends on add lots [ph] or new incoming volume in Q3. And I think your outlook overall next year for services is in the ballpark. Kind of, I think overall, our underlying growth on an internal basis, we're looking at 2% to 3% storage and relatively flat service numbers. And obviously, paper and things like that will have some impact on that. But given our current view, that those are reasonable estimates.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And that flattish comment about service for 2014 was an internal comment, right?","Brian P. McKeon","That was internal, that's right. So there's about 2.5% benefit overall from the acquisitions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Wanted to ask first on kind of the data center strategy, Bill, and maybe Brian as well. Just kind of, can you help us phase in what you think kind of what a reasonable capital outlay for that business is? And then more strategically, can you just talk about how, as kind of a real estate play here, Iron Mountain is going to differentiate in the marketplace versus some, already some pretty good competitors? And then maybe lastly, if you haven't already, can you comment on if this data center that you're currently starting construction on is spec or if it already has some tenants?","William L. Meaney","I think, first of all, this is -- the reason why we have an emerging business, this is a step-by-step approach, as we said it is. We invest capital based on where we see that this potential demand is the way to test it out. So right now, our plan is the $40 million that we've discussed, that we've earmarked, which is both expanding our operation in Boyers in the underground facility, as well as building the aboveground facility at our campus in Northborough, Massachusetts. I think that the other part of your question is how do we compete against the other players in this space, is the feedback -- and I was actually with a customer last week, the feedback we're getting is that because of our strong customer relationships on the data protection side and our understanding in terms of what CIOs and data center infrastructure people understand what their business is about, is that they're very comfortable talking to us, especially when they start thinking about their archiving strategy in a more continuous method. So what we're finding is that we actually do have a differentiated brand. And in fact, we've hired a couple of people who used to be in what are competitors to us today. So early days still, but we felt confident, enough based on the lead generation and customers that we're starting to sign up, that this was, is definitely a business that we should pay attention to and continue to test and develop. So I think right now, I think that's where we are. I think in terms of customers signed up, as you probably can appreciate it, is that it's chicken and egg. In other words, to sign somebody into a colo or a wholesale data center contract, and the Northborough facility is more about colocation, is that the facility has to be done or nearly done. But we didn't break ground until we had a robust enough pipeline of leads that we felt comfortable that this was a very low-risk opportunity to, or a low-risk investment in terms of to start the construction. And at this point, we haven't signed anyone for the Northborough facility, but we have a strong pipeline that we feel pretty comfortable with that we'll be able to get traction relatively soon when the facility is completed.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then I wanted to just dig in on some of your comments. You kind of mentioned that there are several PLRs with the IRS. As we look at the 8-K from the summer, it really seemed like that the racking was the one that was specifically called out there as kind of the main issue. Not looking for any insight as to where we are in the process, but just to understand the scope and the number of issues in front of the IRS, should investors be thinking about that summer 8-K on racking as really the kind of the crux of the issue? Or are there other, in these several PLRs that are out there, that also we should be thinking about or contemplating as we think about the company here today?","Brian P. McKeon","So Andrew, there are a range of topics that we sought clarity from the IRS in terms of REIT conversion. Just going back to what we said in the past, there are, in our lens, a few key issues. Racking is one of them. Goodwill is another topic. There's some specifics related to our business model on how we store items that results to something that we wanted to clarify. The issue of racking was specifically what the IRS had highlighted when they informed us about the formation of the working group and the delay in the process. And so that was the issue that they were centered on, related to whatever it is they're sorting out through the working group. There are other topics that we need to clarify. And consistent with what we've said all along, going back in time, and as we've said, we feel good about our arguments. And it's not certain, the outcomes are uncertain here, but we feel good about our arguments and positioning, and we'll continue to work to be ready to become a REIT, assuming we can get favorable clarification on that over time.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So is it fair to say that just because these other issues weren't mentioned in the 8-K that you filed this summer that, that does not necessarily mean that they're fully addressed or signed off on by the IRS?","Brian P. McKeon","Trying to answer that question, though -- we haven't referred to getting clarity on other issues with the IRS.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Bill, in terms of the search, what are you looking for in terms of CFO? And as you think about that, just any characteristics you're looking for. I mean, Brian has obviously done a wonderful job operationally. What are you focused on as you think about the next candidate in that seat?","William L. Meaney","Look, I think you can have a long list and it can be trying to identify purple squirrels, so to speak. I think that we feel pretty good that we have strong internal candidates. But it's like any of these situations, you need to go outside and look at the benchmarks. And we will look across both the REIT and non-REIT world. It's going to be important whoever is the CFO going forward has a strong operating bend as well as a good financial bend because we do have a fairly -- I wouldn't say complex business, but we have a lot of moving pieces and it's a very global business. So we think we have both strong internal candidates, but we also think it's important to benchmark those people against what the market also has available to us. So we'll see how we progress. But one other thing that I highlighted on the call, about Harry's move with JT coming in his place, Brian's moving out and Rod is coming in, it is a company that we take seriously succession planning and building bench strength. So we feel like we're in good shape. But at the same time, I think for good diligence, we should go out and see what the market has.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then, kind of any sense on timing -- I know, when kind of Brian came in, John had transitioned before Brian came in. Any sense of timing on when we should expect an announcement?","William L. Meaney","No. I think we're in the process of appointing a headhunter to assist us with it, and we're going to go through as fast and deliberate as we can, but I don't think that we can be pinned down to a timing at this point.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then just shifting gears, looking at kind of the storage internal growth. I mean, it looks like we're seeing a pretty consistent trend in terms of a slower rate of destruction, and obviously, the storage overall benefiting. That seems pretty consistent with past recoveries. As you think about the reacceleration and the internal growth in the core storage business, is this tracking pretty similar to past recoveries? And should we expect more organic sales as kind of -- overall, I know it's always a function of -- there's a macro component to it. But any kind of flavor on that as well?","William L. Meaney","Kevin, I think that I wouldn't, because I think that -- look, especially given a lot of the -- there's been a lot of legal holds recently as well. And some of it is just driven by legal holds. And as those cases get cleared, you can get some lumpiness in terms of the destruction. So I wouldn't, at this point, read too much into those trends. I think where some of the things that we're highlighting, which I discussed in an earlier question, about how we're making some realignments and adjustments in our go-to-market, that we think that we're going to get a better response and share of, say, the middle market, I think, is where the benefit is going to come from. At this point, I wouldn't start reading too much into trends around destruction. I think where our attention is focusing on much more improving the inbounding rather than thinking that we have a lot of control or see a different trend on the destruction side.","Brian P. McKeon","I would say I think the trends reinforce the durability of this business, and we're doing quite well in a slower-growth global economy, and I think have opportunities to build on that operationally. And if there's improvement in the macro economy, that can help us as well over time.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Great, and then just if I could, what percentage of the business now is kind of middle market versus larger enterprise, on the storage side?","Brian P. McKeon","Roughly half of our business is customers, larger customers with multiyear agreements, and roughly half are customers that are relatively smaller, that are on annual agreements, and that's in terms of revenue, not in terms of number of customers. Obviously, they'd be more smaller. But I think that the opportunity here is to not just increase the focus on the relatively small customers, but also to extend our reach a bit here and really fully develop that opportunity. And in terms of the un-vended opportunity, I think there's a lot of indications that there's still substantial potential there. So we have a good established base, but I think it's something that the company can build on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On the lines of the services, Brian, you answered Andrew earlier on, I believe it was core service as kind of an outlook for next year. And I just want to confirm that was core as opposed to overall service, because I noticed in the press release, complementary services decreased due to delayed timing in some document management services and special projects. And the second part of this question is, are you seeing a buildup now of special project activity and it's just delayed? Or is that a more broad, longer-term statement?","Brian P. McKeon","The special project was just a very specific reference to the quarter, just kind of near-term activity, just trying to highlight some of the drivers. And the reference was to core service. Overall service probably is going to be flattish as well, just because we do anticipate some pressure from -- given where paper prices are currently, offsetting some of the gains that we're making on other fronts. But I think overall, a relatively flattish core service outlook before acquisitions and internal growth of 2% to 3% storage.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question will be with regard to acquisitions, you guys mentioned, somewhere in the prepared remarks, that the kind of the long-term guidance for acquisitions was somewhere, domestic and emerging, $50 million to $150 million, and kind of near the high end of range of that, without even bringing Cornerstone into the mix. So I just want to get an update on how you're thinking about that longer term. Is there going to be a pause? Or is it a bit of a pedal to the metal from here?","William L. Meaney","Scott, I think that we have -- if we look at International, we've got a pretty strong pipeline, so I don't see much pausing, because we've got them queued up, to a certain degree. But it's opportunistic. We don't chase deals and we don't chase markets. But we are constantly scanning the horizon, and we see, especially in the International side, some good opportunities. We see some possible good bolt-ins in some of our core markets to keep those strong and healthy, and our cash flow going forward. But it's also opportunistic. We don't control the timing on these things. But we feel pretty good, for instance, with the International pipeline.","I think we probably have to kind of close it and wrap it up then, if it's okay. We're a little bit over time. So I want to thank you, operator. And to wrap it up, just to emphasize, we had a good quarter, driven by consistent growth in our storage rental business and we made good progress on all 3 key pillars of our strategy, which is sustaining growth in the mature markets, growing our presence in the emerging markets and evaluating, incubating and scaling new emerging businesses. Our financial position continues to be strong and we feel good about the opportunities to grow the business at attractive returns on capital, based on what we see going forward. We've enhanced our focus on the key drivers of value for the business and are starting to realign the organization for maximum efficiency and to go after those opportunities. As we implement our plan, we will always continue to focus on improving capital allocation, maximizing the total returns and delivering a sustainable value to our shareholders. So I want to thank you all for joining us this morning, and let's hope the Sox keep it up.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 2014 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. You may begin your conference.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights of the quarter and strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","As is our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release.","Before I turn the call over to Bill Meaney, I would like to add that, on February 28, we stated that we were in discussions with the IRS on a number of our PLR requests and we did not intend to provide additional interim updates with respect to any of the specific PLR requests, or generally, our progression through the IRS's PLR process. Accordingly, we will not be discussing the status of our PLR request on today's call.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William L. Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. I would like to thank those of you who attended our investor conference last month. We very much appreciate the opportunity to present our strategy for future growth and to demonstrate the durability in low volatility, which have become a hallmark of Iron Mountain.","Before I discuss our results for the quarter, I want to knowledge that many, if not all, of you who are looking for an update with respect to our conversion to a REIT. As Melissa just said in our forward-looking statements, we will not be discussing the status of our PLR request on today's call.","Turning now to the performance of our business. Total revenue for the quarter was $770 million, up 4.7% on a constant dollar basis with adjusted OIBDA of $229 million and adjusted EPS of $0.26 per share, all of which were in line with our expectations. We maintained our high enterprise adjusted OIBDA margins of roughly 30% during the quarter with consistent performance in our North American segments and international margins coming in slightly ahead of our targeted level of about 25%.","In addition, we achieved solid operating results as we advanced our strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high-return business in developed markets, expand into high-growth emerging markets and invest in emerging business opportunities, the most advanced of which is our data center business.","Storage rental revenue, the key economic driver of our business, was up 5.3% in constant dollars, reflecting strong growth of nearly 13% in our international business and constant dollar growth of roughly 3% in both North American Records and Information Management or RIM and North America Data Management or DM. This breakout for North America is consistent with the way we manage our business and is reflected in our new segment disclosure, which I discussed during our Investor Day. Rod will have more detail on our segmented results shortly.","Total storage rental internal growth was 1.4% for the first quarter. North America RIM internal growth was impacted by a mix shift to slightly lower average pricing on some contract renewals, which were biased towards a mix of enterprise customers. These contract renewals have led to better retention rates and we have seen North America RIM volume up approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the end of Q4 on an internal basis.","As we noted at our recent event, there are several elements to driving storage growth in our developed markets. It is a mix of organic volume growth from existing customers; sales from new customers, including those that were previously un-vended; and some fold-in M&A at the right price with solid returns. And on top of that, you have price.","We continue to analyze optimum pricing across our customer base and that sometimes means taking some deliberate price dilution to win long-term volume and\/or sustain the durability of our customer relationships. All this being said, we continue to be able to invest in our customer relationships and product development through ongoing productivity enhancements. We maintained our North American RIM margins with a 37.5% margin versus 37% last year through continuous improvement initiatives, which we undertake to yield both real productivity gains and to modify our cost base as the business becomes more archival for certain segments.","Our financial and operating results were further enhanced by the successful integration of acquisitions completed in 2013. Acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy. They enable us to achieve leadership positions in emerging markets and leverage our unparalleled platform of people, properties and services in developed markets.","As always, our acquisition strategy is guided by our capital allocation approach through which we must exceed our cost of capital and achieve targeted returns in excess of our hurdle rates. Moreover, we always undertake acquisitions with a view how an investment can further both our market leadership, as well as the continued durability of our business.","We've been actively executing against our deal pipeline since the beginning of the year, completing 5 international transactions representing $60 million of total consideration and another $5 million of tuck-in acquisitions in the U.S. In developed markets, our leading platform allows us to quickly and accretively integrate acquisitions and achieve targeted returns. These tuck-in acquisitions have very attractive fold-in economics with ROIC of 10% plus or roughly mid-teens equity returns.","Internationally, we closed 3 deals in Turkey and Poland. Both are emerging market transactions with attractive growth characteristics where we have achieved or are developing market leadership positions.","Constant dollar storage rental growth from emerging markets was 32% in the first quarter with an internal storage rental growth of 13%. As we recently highlighted, we have a strong pipeline of additional opportunities in emerging markets, representing more than 3x the level needed to achieve our goal of generating an incremental $100 million to $120 million in revenue from emerging market acquisitions by the end of 2016.","Combined with 10% plus compounded annual growth in revenue from our existing base, we believe we can grow this portion of our business to 16% of total revenues by the end of 2016 from 11.6% of total constant dollar revenues today and from a previous base of 10% less than a year ago.","With regard to emerging businesses. We are on track with bringing our first data center near Boston online by the end of the second quarter. We invested an additional $6 million in the first quarter to complete the first phase of the construction and we are pleased with the interest we are seeing. Since applying a focus on the business a year ago, we have seen all of the existing customers in our underground data center in Pennsylvania increase their custom with us by 10% to 15%, in line with industry averages.","We completed our first foray into the colo market in the underground last December, and we have already contracted for 30% of the space with a pipeline equal to approximately 10x the remaining space available.","Additionally, we are seeing more deals and larger deals in our pipeline. For the first phase of our 3-phase, 6-megawatt campus near Boston, we have strong customer interest with a pipeline of about 3x our initial capacity there. We are still in the early stages of developing this business, but we are pleased with what we're seeing in terms of interest and expect to achieve attractive returns on investment. We continue to monitor our progress and invest capital in a success-based manner.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2014, we anticipate continued solid constant dollar revenue, storage rental revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the long-term goals we've discussed in the past. We expect consistent trends for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets and a moderation in the rate of service revenue declines.","In our emerging markets, we are maintaining and modestly improving our profitability even as we add to our emerging market base. We are on track to make this segment, which achieves low double-digit internal storage growth rates, a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. Moreover, in our emerging business area, we continue to identify and test opportunities, which are near adjacencies to our core business and resonate with our customers.","Overall, it was a solid quarter anchored by further progress on our strategic plan. We believe we are on track to deliver against our 2014 goals, as well as our longer-term objectives. As a reminder, those are to: first, deliver total shareholder returns in the range of 8% to 9% in line with the S&P 500, provide predictable earnings and dividend growth with low volatility and nurture our ability to generate potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities.","On a final note, whilst we are not providing any PLR updates, as we have said and reiterated at our Investor Day, we believe we fit well as a REIT due to our sizable real estate portfolio and attractive characteristics such as a high net operating income per square foot, low turnover costs and high customer quality and retention. The REIT structure also complements our strategy whilst enhancing payouts to our stockholders and highlights our highly disciplined approach around asset allocation.","As a REIT, we would continue to generate the cash flow necessary to sustain the durability of the business and support attractive stockholder returns in line with our long-term strategic plan.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.","Roderick Day","Thanks, Bill. Let's now turn to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid results in Q1, which were supported by strong constant dollar storage rental growth, good profit performance and the benefits from recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets.","As Bill stated, storage rental growth grew 5.3% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter. This was supported by 3.0% and 2.8% growth in the North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments, respectively, as well as 12.7% growth in the International segment.","Adjusted OIBDA was in line with expectations in Q1. Included in our first quarter adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS is $2.4 million of restructuring charges, as well as $3.5 million in charges for the insurance deductible associated with the recent fire in one of our facilities in Argentina. We expect to incur an additional $3.3 million in the remainder of 2014 in connection with the organizational realignment.","Our Q1 '14 CapEx of $47 million, excluding real estate and REIT costs, was in line with our expectations.","Free cash flow of negative $20 million was primarily driven by higher cash interest expense, the payment for restructuring charges accrued at the year end, as well as the timing of payables. Looking at the free cash flow on a rolling 12-month basis, this was $320 million, in line with our projections.","At this time, we are not making any changes to our guidance. Although 2014 full year results will be boosted by recent acquisitions, this increase to revenue will be partially offset by the FX losses based on current rates. In addition, there is some volatility relating to costs in Argentina, but at this time, our best view is these fall within the range of our guidance.","Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. As we discussed previously, during this quarter, we amended our reporting structure to align the way we manage the business. We changed the composition of our North American segment to the following 3 operating segments: first, North American Records and Information Management or RIM; second, the North American Data Management or DM; and finally, the emerging businesses. Emerging businesses are currently a component of the corporate and other segment.","As we break down the numbers, Q1 operating results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. Enterprise revenues grew 4.7% on a constant dollar basis as our International segment continued to produce strong results. Indeed, International posted 12.8% constant dollar total revenue growth helped by benefits from our recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets.","North American RIM posted 2.7% constant dollar total revenue growth.","North American DM posted a 1 .5% decline in constant dollar total revenue. As we mentioned at our recent Investor Day, this business is becoming more archival in nature, which has created headwinds in the service revenue, although, to be clear, we continue to see consistent growth in DM storage revenue.","Our corporate and other segment reflects revenue from our data center business. FX rate changes reduced total growth by approximately 160 basis points in the quarter.","Adjusted OIBDA was $229 million, up 0.5% including the previously mentioned $2.4 million restructuring and the $3.5 million insurance deductible charges. A key driver of profit performance was the continued improvement in our International segments, as well as margin improvement in our North American RIM segments.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.26 per share compared to $0.27 in Q1 2013.","GAAP earnings per share were $0.22, including $10 million of REIT costs, $5 million of other expense and $8 million of gains primarily from the disposal of property assets in the United Kingdom as we continue to consolidate our operations.","Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39.4%.","Let's now take a closer look at the components of revenue growth on Slide 5. Overall, total revenue internal growth was 0.5%. When we add the benefit from acquisitions of 4.2% and the offsetting 1.6% impact from negative foreign currency movements, total revenue reported growth was 3.1% for the quarter. Storage rental growth of 1.4% reflects the pricing mix that Bill described. However, we maintain solid margins in the business due to our speed and agility initiatives.","Looking at the storage service split. Total storage rental growth of 5.3% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance. North American RIM reported 3.0% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting flat records management volume, pricing of 0.8% and the benefits from recent acquisitions. Records and Information Management pricing gains were below historical quarters, which reflects taking some appropriate pricing management to win and\/or sustain the durability of customer relationships.","North American DM reported 2.8% constant dollar storage rental growth driven by organic revenue, which was 2.3% for the quarter.","International storage rental growth was 12.7% constant dollar for the quarter, reflecting 32% storage rental revenue growth in emerging markets, supported by strong organic growth and the benefits from acquisition.","Internal storage rental growth remained strong with a 5.2% gain in the quarter.","Total service revenues were up 3.8% on a constant dollar basis, supported by recent acquisitions, as well as increases in imaging projects and shredding activity, offset somewhat by a decrease in paper pricing when compared with the period 1 year ago.","In North American RIM, paper-related revenue increased due to volume increases, but this was partially offset by average paper price declines approximately 5% year-on-year. On a more general level, as noted in recent quarters, we have seen a moderation in the rate of decline in our North American RIM service business.","DM Service revenues are experiencing headwinds associated with the trend towards reduced activity levels and related transport revenues.","International service growth was boosted by acquisitions and special projects.","Let's now move to Slide 6 to discuss our volume growth. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, our proprietary customer insights platform is giving us a better view on customer thinking and that's resulting in lower levels of termination. Also as noted, despite secular trends in the use of paper, we continue to see roughly the same amount of incoming volume from existing customers. In addition, we are seeing an uptick in new sales, and of course, volumes are bolstered by acquisition activity. The resulting worldwide net volume growth of 6.7% in Q1 '14 is compared to the previous year.","Let's now move to Slide 7 to discuss our segments in more detail. Consistent with our strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segments as we continue to build out our International segment as a significant driver of profit. North America Records and Information Management delivered solid profits and reported revenues of $446 million increasing 2.7% on a constant dollar basis. This increase was driven by acquisitions. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 50 basis points year-over-year due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our restructuring efforts. We're also sustaining capital efficiency with spending at 3.8% of revenues excluding real estate.","North American Data Management delivered revenues of $97 million for Q1, which declined by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis, primarily due to the decline in service revenues. This service decline was the result of a trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as the business becomes more archival. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined by 400 basis points year-over-year due to the service revenue headwinds and cost reductions not yet being in proportion to the decline in revenue.","Our International segment continues to post strong revenues and contribution progress. Adjusted OIBDA increased 23.8% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from good global growth and cost improvement initiatives in developed markets. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s target with adjusted OIBDA margins of 26.2% for the first quarter.","Finally, corporate and other revenue was down due to a change in contract terms with an early-stage customer as we continue to build out our pipeline in the data center business. Adjusted OIBDA was down compared to prior year levels, driven by the insurance deductible, restructuring costs, compensation and consulting fees relating to various strategic initiatives.","Let's now talk about our acquisitions for 2014 on Slide 8. Acquisitions are an important element of our stated business strategy to drive continued profitable growth in our developed markets and to further penetrate attractive emerging markets. Through the end of April, we have completed 5 core transactions, investing approximately $60 million. These include 3 deals in Turkey and Poland, which enhanced our leadership position in these emerging markets, and the acquisition of a leading provider of off-site data storage and data protection services in Australia. In addition, we increased our ownership of a joint venture in Denmark.","Post-acquisition, we generally realize the benefits of operating efficiencies within the first year or so. However, acquisition integration costs impacts our adjusted OIBDA for the first year. Benefits derived from rationalizing the real estate portfolio in an acquisition may take up to several years depending on the size of the business, lease expiration dates and the volume that needs to be moved. All of this is factored into our valuation models as we make our investment decisions.","Our acquisition pipeline remains robust and we will continue to evaluate these opportunities through disciplined capital allocation and a return on capital lens, ensuring we create value for our shareholders.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 and look at our current debt. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We are well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At the quarter end, liquidity was about $560 million with $170 million in cash and $390 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.1x, which is the high end of our targeted range, has increased over the past 3 years as planned to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. Further, as previously stated, we expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range in the short term due to costs associated with the REIT conversion.","Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. In Q1, we paid $53 million in cash dividends and $10 million of REIT costs including REIT-related CapEx. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy while advancing substantial payments to shareholders, and we remain well positioned to fund our business.","So this concludes our review. In summary, Q1 was a good quarter, supported by sustained storage rental performance, continued high levels of profitability in our North American segments and strong International performance and recent acquisitions. We continue to execute against our strategy, extending our reach into high-growth emerging markets, driving continued profitable growth in our developed markets and prudently pursuing new business opportunities that are adjacent to our core business.","And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from George Tong.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Could you provide some color on your organic storage revenue trends? I see they improved fractionally from last quarter, but the organic internal growth remains below your 2% historical range. Just some color on what drove performance in the quarter or when you might expect growth to return back to your 2% historical level.","William L. Meaney","George, thanks for your question. The 1.4%, and if you see our historical trends which were kind of 2%, 2.5%, I think we made a deliberate decision and you can see it in terms of our retention rates. Our retention rates are up about 30 basis points and when we were looking at renewing large enterprise customers, we look at retention, obviously, which is a key driver in terms of our long-term economic performance, the terms, in other words, how long those are. So for example, we just renewed a financial service client where we not only increased the volume that we have with that client, but we went from a normal 5-year contract to a 10-year contract. So we put all that into the mix when we look at that. So overall, what we're trying -- what we look at is optimizing or maximizing the revenue and profitability of our customers and we look at price, we look at volume and retention, we look at the length of the contract and the contract terms, all with a view in terms of building the durability of our business. So if you put that in the mix and you see where we've delivered on the OIBDA, so you said, well, historically, we were at 2%, 2.5%. We were at 1.4%, but we increased retention by 30 basis points and we still hit our OIBDA target. So it's a number of things, the variables that we look at. And when we look at these specific renewals, it made a lot more sense to make sure that we improved our retention rate, especially with a view of signing up longer contract terms.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's very helpful. And could you provide some additional detail on the organization realignment actions you've taken in the quarter and what benefits from a cost perspective you expect to see as a result?","William L. Meaney","I think that the -- first, it's consistent with what we said on an earlier call, I think, it was back in October when we discussed our reorganization, is that whilst there is a reduction in our cost base associated with it, that was not the motivation for our realignment. And the realignment was triggered back in October, but some of that is just falling through in terms of the restructuring costs in quarter 1 of 2014. So the reorganization was, for the most part, completed last year, but there were some kind of carry-on in terms of the first quarter. The main part of that was taking out 2 layers in our North American organization and mimicking what we have probably internationally that comes naturally around the country organization and we've instilled this -- installed something similar in the United States where we've put a lot more accountability into the local markets and that was really with a view to be more competitive in the mid-market segment. Combined with our acquisition of Cornerstone, those 2 things came together with the reorganization, as I say, again with a view to be more competitive and have more accountability going after the mid-sized segment.","Operator","I'll go to the next question. It is from Scott [indiscernible].","Unknown Analyst","I guess, following up on George's first question, I think you partially answered it. But we've seen a nice trend in terminations and destructions and you were talking about retention, but could you delve in a little bit more on the progress you've made there and what you're seeing?","William L. Meaney","I can -- maybe I'll give the first part of the answer and then let Rod emphasize because he was also referring to some of the tools that we've introduced. But we have brought in some more, I would say, sophisticated tools and then made some investments to better predict when we seem to be losing traction with customers. And when we go in early on, you have a much more, I would say, robust discussion, which includes how long we can renew the contract for. So we saw some contracts, which normally renew for 3 years and we renewed them for 5 years, as I highlighted just previously. We had a contract where we didn't have anywhere near the share of wallet that we do now. Actually, we went from having a fraction of their wallet to 100% of their wallet and instead of a 5-year contract to a 10-year contract. And when we look at that, that leads to not only better retention rates, which as we said you can see the results in this quarter. Whether you look at North America or you look at our overall business, we've improved retention rates by about 30 basis points. But in addition is we are gaining better terms and conditions in terms of the length of those contracts, which, as you know, for us, this is a -- it's all about the durability and low volatility of our business. And then, Rod, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Roderick Day","Well, just to build on that a little bit, Bill, there's really 2 sides to the equation here. Scott, one is we've invested in sort of predictive analytics to better understand the likelihood of customers terminating or destroying then trying to work with them in a more proactive way, both for our benefit as well as their benefit. And I do think we're seeing the consequences of that starting to come through in some of our key volumetrics. The other thing that we use to sort of build from that is to think more about the long-term value of the customer relationship rather than as sort of just a short-term quick win that we might try and get. So by thinking about that and then structuring that value into the contract over a longer period of time, again we think it's better for us and better for the customer. So hopefully, and I think we are operating in a more sort of sophisticated manner.","Unknown Analyst","Is this fairly broad based? Are you seeing any variances across the end markets, which you serve with regard to destructions and terminations, and for that matter, new business wins?","William L. Meaney","I think that probably the best way, you have to have a little bit of a helicopter view, especially our exposure to financial services where you have legal holes in specific markets that can skew the data one way or the other on any given period. I think we have to look at -- I think probably the better way to look at it is do we see a different trend, say, in North America versus our other developed markets, say, in Western Europe or Australia. And I would say that we see very consistent -- we're using similar approaches to the market that Rod just described and I would say we're seeing similar trends, almost identical trends, across both of those markets in the improvement that we're getting.","Unknown Analyst","And then, finally, if I could slip in one more. Just how is the pricing environment across storage and service, what you're seeing, what may be some of the pushbacks you're hearing from customers or are they fairly open to the strategies you're applying?","William L. Meaney","I think the price -- again, I'm going to let Rod maybe follow up. But I think, first of all, on the price is that, from our customers, is it's much more important in terms of what their overall, both quality and cost, of their whole records program is. And quality is about, obviously, making sure -- if you think about this as a safety deposit box for some of the most valuable documents for our customers, it's making sure that those things are stored in a way and can be retrieved in a timely fashion when they need them. And the other thing is to make sure they have a robust records management program, which means that they retain the things that they need to and they don't retain the things that they don't need to. So that's -- and then the other aspect is how much does that whole program cost? So those are the types of discussions that we have with our customers rather than on a specific price. I think, in any low-inflation environment is that everybody is driven by trying to get more productivity out of their operations and we're not immune to that like any other vendor. But the conversation we're having with our customers is how can we reduce the cost of their total program and at the same time, improve the quality of that program, which may mean lower volume for some customers in certain areas, but it definitely doesn't mean lower margin from our standpoint.","Roderick Day","I think that's right, Bill. Really, what we're trying to get at is what value can we bring to the customer? It's a complicated mix. It's not just storage, there's a whole lot of service elements that we provide as well. And as the industry leader, we're concerned to make sure we bring that value and demonstrate that value to the customer. So as part of our negotiations, it's a sort of wider and more holistic discussion, I suppose, rather than just a simple price discussion. And I think by doing that, it's good for us and it's good for the customer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum.","Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","This is Josh James, actually, filling in for Shlomo. I just wonder if you could give us an update...","William L. Meaney","Shlomo, I'm sorry, can you just speak up? We're just barely hearing you.","Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","This is actually Josh James filling in for Shlomo. I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on how the Cornerstone acquisition is progressing?","William L. Meaney","I think in terms of the integration, Josh, it's ahead of plan. I think the revenue is slightly lower than what we originally expected. But in terms of overall OIBDA delivery, it's -- we're comfortably ahead of plan. I mean, that was, in effect, much more similar to a large pickup and move. The other thing, as I alluded to earlier on the call, is where we've picked up significant benefit is insight on how our commercial operations can be better aligned to serving customers in what I would call the mid-market. So I think between those 2 things in terms of our ability to integrate and synergize it quicker than we thought and then also pick up some DNA about going after or aligning some of our commercial operations to the middle market, I would say it's gone quite well. I don't know, Rod, if you want to comment about on any of the financial?","Roderick Day","Yes, I mean, I think just on the revenue point, just to be clear, it was never that far off in terms of our expectations when we went into the deal sort of few hundred thousand. And actually, as we've been able to work with the business, that gap, if you like, has been closing as the months have progressed. So actually, I think we're encouraged by their performance, by what we've seen top line and bottom line pluses, as Bill said, very sort of secondary benefits in terms of better understanding of small and mid-market that we can gain from.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Dolev.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Question about North American OIBDA margins. They've been down a few quarters in a row. What would need to happen for North America margins to maybe bottom or start to reaccelerate at some point?","William L. Meaney","I think, it's really -- I'll let Rod comment more specifically, but it's really a tale of 2 stories. I think the OIBDA margins of North America haven't gone down when you look at our storage business. But as the business becomes more archival, then the service side of the business does take certain headwinds and there are 2 things going on: one is paper prices makes a fairly large impact on that, but the other thing is that as the business becomes more archival, whether you look at the RIM business or the DM business, is that you can only -- you can only be so proactive in terms of restructuring your cost base because you still have to service the customers until they become that less active. So it is kind of a thing where we can be proactive to a certain degree, but during this transition, until the declines in service revenue or the archival nature kind of flattens out in the business, there will continue to be pressure under the service side of the margins. But to be clear on the storage side is we are maintaining our margins on the storage side, and in fact, in most cases, improving them. So I don't know, Rod, if you want to...","Roderick Day","Yes, I think that's right. And you can see that a little bit in our numbers for the quarter actually. Because on the RIM side, the Records and Information Management side, if you look year-on-year, our margins actually improved by 50 basis points. And there's sort of 3 drivers of that, if you like. One is sort of ongoing good performance within storage. Two is the sort of slowdown in the rate of decline that we've seen in service within the RIM side of things. And three, sort of within that context, we've also been very proactive about taking out costs to try and sort of make sure we can maintain and enhance margin. So you can see that coming through in the RIM segment. If you look at Data Management, though, you do see a decline in margins, which is where the service decline is more accentuated at this point. And that presents us with a challenge, if you like, in terms [ph] of having to sort of take costs out as quickly as we can, so at least try and mitigate that impact. So it depends a little bit in terms of where we're at within the segment. But at least on the RIM side, we're up. And Data Management where we are seeing more of these service headwinds, we're down, but taking action on the cost side.","William L. Meaney","And I think on the -- the only thing I would just add to what Rod said is on the -- and if we look at Data Management, remember, we're talking about a base of 60% OIBDA margins on that business. And the storage component, whilst we've seen a decline as the business becomes -- tape is used much more for archive than backup purposes, we've seen an increase in our storage volume even though that tape format is becoming more efficient, et cetera. So we actually -- the amount of data that we're storing continues to grow. It's not for backup as much anymore, it's much more for archival. And you need to do this in the context that we're talking about at 60% margin business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I didn't want to ask about your IRS process, but I did want to get your view on any implications or your thoughts really around the successful conversions of Lamar, CBS Outdoor and what that could potentially mean for the kind of overall thinking?","William L. Meaney","Well, that was a good way of, Andy, not asking a question about the REIT process. All I can say is we congratulate them both. I mean, we're in a completely different business segment, so I don't think you can read much into their process versus ours. But I appreciate the question.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I mean, what you gave us is fair and to hear that is actually helpful. Also wanted to get a thought, just kind of on that sales strategy for the mid-market, as well as what you did with the verticalization. Are you seeing benefits from that already or is that still yet to come? Just kind of your view of the success there.","William L. Meaney","I think that there's still a lot more to come. I think we are clearly seeing some. I mean, I think that the 30 basis points of improvement on retention -- don't forget, retention is almost the same as selling for us because of our presence and leadership in a lot of these segments, right. So retention is an important bellwether and it is getting closer to the customers through verticalization, through using better analytical tools that Rod discussed in his remarks. I think this is all starting to have a benefit. That being said, some of the things that we're doing around the middle market and even for a large enterprise customers, I think it's early days. As we discussed at Investor Day, we're in the process of standing up a central marketing operation under a chief marketing officer that's still being implemented. So I do think there are ways where, as a company, we can use our unique scale to further our leadership position and I think that there's more to be done, but we are starting to see some benefits, as we've highlighted, around retention.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just a final question, Rod. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a flavor as to the acquisitions that you've done this year. I guess, we've kind of heard you've added some acquisitions, you've had some FX headwinds. No change to the guidance because, obviously, the annuity is large. But can you help us -- can you put a pencil to the paper on what the FX dollar headwind and the revenue benefit is from the acquisitions for the year?","Roderick Day","So approximately, for the acquisitions, we'd be looking at around $20 million, something like that. And there will be more detail in the 10-K on this. And similar kind of offset on the FX side.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And to be clear, the 2014 contributions, so it's partial year contribution from these acquisitions, not the run rate annualized contribution of revenue?","Roderick Day","No, sorry, that's annualized. But the fact is we sort of made these acquisitions fairly early in the year, so actually wouldn't be far off that number.","Operator","There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to CEO, Bill Meaney, for closing remarks.","William L. Meaney","Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter with strong constant dollar growth and margins. We have many attractive investment opportunities in order to grow our business over the long term and we'll do so prudently, consistent with our focused capital allocation approach. At the same time, we will continue to sustain the durability of our storage rental business, expand our presence in emerging markets and pursue attractive emerging business opportunities. We believe our durable platform and deliberate growth plan will continue to deliver opportunity and maximize total returns for our shareholders. Moreover, the value of these returns are further enhanced due to the higher certainty and lower volatility inherent in the nature of our business, which combines a durable and global customer base with superior scale.","Thank you for joining us this morning.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa Marsden. You may begin.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to our Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. And this morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open up the phone for Q&A. And as is our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2.

As many of you know, he will be leaving Iron Mountain end of March, and I know you all join me in wishing him well in his future endeavors. Also, Colton Bria [ph], our new Director of IR, is here today and looking forward to working with you moving forward.","With that, Bill, care to [ph] begin?","William L. Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic fire that burned one of our record storage facilities outside Buenos Aires earlier this month. We're deeply saddened by the death of the very first responders who rushed to save our facility, as well as their colleagues injured while fighting the blaze. As reported, all Iron Mountain employees who worked in that facility are safe and accounted for. The building was equipped with both fire detection, as well as sprinkler systems, and we continue to work with authorities in participating fully in the investigation to understand what happened. Whilst this -- that is ongoing, our collective thoughts and prayers remain with the brave firefighters and their families and those injured fighting the blaze.","I also wish to thank 4 employees of Iron Mountain who rushed into the fire to fight it until they were ordered to leave by the fire brigade. Their display of bravery, selflessness has been moving to all of us, and I am proud to be one of their colleagues.","Turning now to performance of our business. We had a strong finish to the year. Financial results for the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations, excluding restructuring charges related to our organizational realignment. In addition, we achieved solid operating results as we advanced our strategy plan -- strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high-return business in developed markets, expanded into high-growth emerging markets and evaluated investment opportunities in promising emerging businesses.","Total revenue for the quarter was USD 769 million, excluding charges of $19 million related to our organizational restructuring, which were in line the amount previewed in our third quarter report. Adjusted OIBDA was $214 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.22 per share for the quarter. The execution of our reorganization went as planned, and we continue to maintain good cost discipline in the wake of these changes. It is early, but we expect the combination of these organizational changes, enhanced enterprise cost controls and the adjusted OIBDA improvement achieved in our International businesses to support our continued high level of profitability.","In our International business, all regions ended the year in line with or ahead of expectations to deliver the adjusted OIBDA improvement target of 25% established 3 years ago. To put that into perspective, this achievement represents improvement of roughly USD 100 million in annualized OIBDA over that time frame. Our fourth quarter results were slightly impacted by foreign currency fluctuations and decreases in paper pricing. We continue to monitor these factors as we move into 2014. But at present, the impact is not significant enough to warrant adjustments to our 2014 full year outlook.","Overall, business fundamentals for the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges, were in line with our expectations and fairly consistent with trends in the recent quarters. Constant dollar storage rental growth for the quarter was quite strong at 4.9%, driven by 12.5% growth in International and consistent 2.2% growth in North America. Total storage rental internal growth was 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This growth rate was impacted by contract renewals and some upfront costs associated with competitive win. Our outlook for storage rental internal growth in 2014 remains consistent with the 2% to 2.5% level we've seen in recent periods.","Flow through from acquisition activity earlier in the year was a meaningful growth driver. We continue to view acquisitions as an important element of our strategy to extend our durable storage rental revenue. We closed on more than USD 320 million of transactions globally during the year whilst building a robust pipeline of additional opportunity. In all cases, our M&A activities must exceed our cost capital and follow our return on invested capital guideline.","In developed markets, our leading platform of people, properties and services allows us to quickly and accretively integrate acquisitions and achieve targeted returns. During the fourth quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Cornerstone Records Management in the U.S. As we work through the integration of Cornerstone, revenue for the period -- partial period was just shy of our target, whilst OIBDA contribution came in slightly ahead of expectations.","Additionally, the first storage facility consolidation from this acquisition occurred in late January, and we have several more plans for the first half of the year, helping us to more quickly realize the integration benefits versus our original plan. As we've noted, we expect this transaction to build attractive bold and economic ROIC of [ph] 10% plus, which translates into the mid-teens in terms of equity returns.","In emerging markets, our strategy remains to acquire or partner with local storage companies to expand our market leadership, enhance returns and capture the initial wave of records outsourcing in these markets. These acquisitions also provide new business from local customers and deepen our relationships with multinational customers who increasingly seek the security and efficiency that can be gained by consolidating records and information management with one global provider.","Late in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Databox in China. Whilst a relatively small transaction, this deal provides its platform from which we can thoroughly investigate the broader market opportunity and learn from our new customers and employees. It also provides entry into several key cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Chongqing, which are in addition to our current locations in China, mainly Hong Kong and Shenzhen. This transaction is addition to 4 deals we successfully on-boarded in Latin America in 2013, which will bring in roughly USD 60 million in annualized revenue. In all cases, we are on track with our business models, which are based upon exceeding risk-adjusted hurdle rates, which exceed our cost of capital.","We have a strong pipeline of additional opportunities in emerging markets. Whilst these markets represent just 10% of our total business today with a 23% increase in constant dollar storage rental growth for the year, they are an important part of our long-term growth strategy and offer significant expansion potential.","With regard to emerging businesses, we are on track construction of our first data center outside of Boston and expect to bring it online before the end of the second quarter. As we noted in our 2014 guidance, we expect to invest roughly USD 40 million in this business in 2014, doing so in phases to minimize risk. And our recent wins and pipeline of deals support our capital plan for the year.","It's early days, but at present, pricing and returns appear healthy in our target segments. We'll have more on this emerging business in our Investor Day in late March, but we are pleased with the progress we're making and the response from both new as well as our current data protection customers.","Let me briefly touch upon our preparations for REIT conversion. Our actual REIT capital and operating expenditures came in within the range we projected back in 2012, and we have successfully completed the internal work necessary to enable us to comply with REIT requirements. Following roughly 6 months of dry run and [ph] testing, we began operating in a manner consistent with being a REIT as of 1 January 2014. License to your appreciation [ph] and thanks to all who have worked tirelessly to get us to this point. By all measures, this is a massive undertaking, and we brought the project in on time and on budget.","Of course, we don't control every step of the process, and we don't yet have final written rulings from the IRS on our outstanding private letter ruling or PLR. However, we took these steps to prepare us for a decision, help preserve the related tax benefits for our stockholders for 2014 and to be able to demonstrate REIT compliance on a look-back basis should we ultimately be successful in converting.","As I noted on last quarter's call, we don't intend to provide interim updates as to the nature of our communications with the IRS, and we cannot make any assurances that the IRS will ultimately provide us with a favorable ruling on our racking structure or other requests.","Once again, the REIT structure does not impact our strategy or how we execute it. It enhances our return. Our strategy continues to be focused on sustaining the durability of the business, maximizing free cash flow and supporting attractive stockholder returns regardless of whether or not we ultimately convert. We generate significant free cash flow, and the amount we have available pursuing strategic investment isn't appreciably different as a REIT or a C-Corp.","We have many attractive opportunities to invest to grow the business over the long term and we'll do so prudently, consistent with our capital allocation focus. As we advance our strategic plan, I wish to reiterate that we are committed to enhancing long-term shareholder return under either a REIT or a C-Corp structure. Over the long term, we will strive for consistent, moderate dividend growth whilst permitting the flexibility to pursue high-return investment.","As we look out to this year, we are reiterating our guidance, which assumes solid constant dollar revenue growth and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the long-term goals we've talked about in the past. We see consistent trends for storage rentals in North America and a moderation in the rate of service activity decline. Internationally, we are improving our commercial focus as being a good trajectory as we move into 2014, driven by both organic growth and high-returning acquisition.","To summarize, we had a solid quarter punctuated by the closing of additional acquisitions, achievement of further milestones related to the REIT preparedness and progress on the execution of our realignment and implementation of our strategic plan. We believe our plan will help us sustain the durability of the business and support long-term growth.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.","Roderick Day","Thanks, Bill, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let's now turn to Slide 3, which highlights key messages of today's review. We had good results in quarter 4 supported by strong constant dollar storage rental growth and international profit gains, as well as benefits from recent acquisitions in Latin America and North America. Storage rental growth grew 5% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter supported by a consistent 2% gain in North America and 13% growth in International. Adjusted OIBDA performance was in line with expectations in Q4, driven by our International business, which achieved its 3-year margin improvement goal, and by sustained cost management. Included in our fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS is $19 million restructuring [ph] charges as discussed on our last earnings call.","Looking at the full year, our revenue adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS results all landed in our guidance ranges. CapEx was a bit higher than originally expected, as we accelerated capital projects from 2014 into 2013. And free cash flow benefited from lower cash taxes due to timing of payments.","Today, we are reiterating our 2014 full year guidance put forth at our Q3 earnings call. We continue to expect, call it, constant dollar growth of 2% to 4% of total revenues and 2% to 5% for adjusted OIBDA.","Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012. Q4 operating results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. Enterprise revenues were 3% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continues to produce strong result. International posted 10% constant dollar revenue growth supported by 13% storage rental growth, including benefits from our recent acquisitions in Colombia and Peru. North America posted flat constant dollar revenue growth, as 2% storage rental gains were offset by lower complementary service revenues. FX rate changes reduced revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points in the quarter.","Adjusted OIBDA was $214 million, up 3%, excluding the $19 million restructuring charge. A key driver of profit performance was continued improvement in our International segments where adjusted OIBDA, excluding $4 million of restructuring charges, increased 32% year-on-year in Q4.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.15 per share or $0.22 per share, excluding restructuring charges, compared to $0.20 in Q4 2012. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, which reduced reported EPS by $0.04 per share net of tax.","GAAP earnings per share, $0.25, including $40 million of REIT costs, $11 million of other expense and a tax benefit related to foreign dividends, favorable all-in [ph] settlements and released certain valuation reserves. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39%.","Let's now take a look -- close look at our revenue on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. For the quarter, storage rental growth of 4.9% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance. Year-on-year global net volume growth was 5.8%, including a 4.5% benefit from our 2013 acquisition. North America reported 2.2% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat records for management volume, pricing of just under 1% and benefits from our recent acquisition. North American pricing gains were below recent quarters, reflecting impacts from contract renewals and some upfront costs associated with competitive win. For the full year, pricing gains were 1.3%.","International storage rental growth was 12.5% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter, reflecting a 29% growth in emerging markets supported by strong organic growth in [ph] benefits from acquisitions. Internal storage rental growth remained strong with a 6.3% gain in the quarter.","Total service revenues, down 40 basis points on a constant dollar basis and International service growth, supported by acquisitions, was offset by North American service declines driven by lower complementary service revenues.","Average paper prices declined 13% year-on-year, resulting in a $5 million less revenue in Q4. For the full year, average paper prices were down 10%.","Overall, total internal growth was negative 1.1% in Q4 as 1.3% gains in storage rental was more than offset by 4.4% service declines.","Let's now move to Slide 6 and review our full year results. Slide 6 looks at our full year 2013 performance compared to 2012. Our results reflect consistent business trends with reported revenue of $3.03 billion, up 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA, excluding restructuring charges of $23 million, was up 1% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EPS of $1.03 per share, down 15% compared to 2012. This reflects the impact of restructuring charges, full year impact of additional shares issued with a special dividend in November 2012 and higher interest expense. These impacts more than offset lower income tax expense.","Capital spending for the year was $223 million, excluding $66 million of real estate and $23 million of REIT conversion capital. As a percent of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate and REIT CapEx, is 7.4%. Capital spending finished slightly higher than guidance, as we accelerated certain projects, including sustainability projects from 2014 into 2013.","Free cash flow for 2013 was $390 million compared to $347 million last year. The year-on-year increase reflects lower cash taxes, which were partially offset by high capital spending.","The 2013 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results here shown excludes $83 million of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced [ph] reported EPS by approximately $0.30.","In addition to the $23 million of REIT-related capital expenditures [ph], we paid $53 million in taxes towards our D&A REIT capital liability. All told, these items reduced free cash flow by $130 million. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT costs and related expenditures in the appendix for this presentation.","Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows the metrics for each of our 3 segments comparing 2013 to 2012. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining higher returns in our North American segments, where we continue to build our International segment, a significant driver of profit and cash flow gain. North America continues to deliver high profit and strong cash. For 2013, our North American business segment reported revenues of $2.2 billion. We sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 41% as increased storage gross margins and SG&A savings offset restructuring costs and pressures from the lower service revenues. We're also sustaining capital efficiencies. We're spending 5.5% of revenues, including real estate.","Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenues, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gain. Adjusted OIBDA increased 19% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from solid global growth and cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets. International adjusted OIBDA margins have expanded more than 300 basis points, excluding the impacts of restructuring costs in 2013, as we achieved our goal of 25% International segment margin.","Finally, corporate expenses were up compared to prior years driven by the restructuring costs and increase in people and professional fees.","Let's now take a look at our debt statistic on Slide 8. Solid cash flow generation enabled us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We are well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $900 million with $120 million in cash and $820 million in additional borrowing capacity.","As discussed on our last call, in the amendment of our credit agreements, we changed our consolidated leverage ratio for compliance purposes to a net total lease adjusted leverage ratio, which is an EBITDAR-based calculation that adds leases [ph] to our total debt. This better aligns with how rating agencies view our leverage. At the end of Q4, that ratio was 5.0 with a requirement not to exceed 6.5.","To align with this new calculation, we're establishing a target of net total lease adjusted leverage range of 4 to 5. This equates to our previous range of 3 to 4, excluding lease financing. Our net total lease adjusted leverage ratio of 5.0x, which is at the high end of our target range, has increased over the past 3 years, as planned, to support shareholder payout, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. Further, as previously stated, we expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range in the short term due to costs associated with REIT conversion.","Our strong cash flow for the quarter continued advance on [ph] our cash allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. In 2013, we paid $207 million in cash dividends and $159 million of REIT costs, including REIT-based CapEx and tax payments related to the depreciation of recapture.","We are managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy while advancing financial payout to [ph] shareholders, and we remain well positioned to fund our business plan.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our 2014 outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our 2014 operating outlook. As I mentioned earlier today, we're reiterating our full year 2014 guidance. We're expecting full year revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.17 billion and adjusted OIBDA of $930 million to $960 million. Our expectations for adjusted EPS and free cash flow remain the same as well. As we have been highlighting, we are incurring significant onetime operating capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to systems investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure.","We invested to ensure that we met the January 1, 2014, deadline in compliance with all REIT requirements. We have met that deadline. We were able to delay certain costs, primarily associated with additional country conversions, and now expect between $32 million and $47 million being heard [ph] in 2014, and we're tightening our guidance range to $185 million to $200 million of these REIT costs. We are also tightening the range for our depreciation recapture payments to $210 million to $225 million. We report -- we have included a table with these REIT-related costs in the appendix for your reference.","That concludes our review. In summary, Q4 was a good quarter supported by strong international performance and the recent acquisition. Our full year performance was in line with our guidance. We continue to execute our business plan with the same high profit and cash flow in North America, driving strong growth and higher return in our International business. We continue to advance work in connection with REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for shareholders.","Thank you. We'd now be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Could you guys just provide us with some thoughts with regards to the margin kind of bouncing around the quarter? But congratulations on the 25% target achievement. What do you see going forward? What are the -- what could be better to help or be a hindrance as we look out into 2014 and beyond?","Roderick Day","Is that question specifically related to International or the business as a whole?","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","No, the International. I'm sorry if I didn't specify.","Roderick Day","Yes, so on International, we expect further improvements in the International margin. Really, it's a continuation of the strategy that we've been having, and it builds leadership positions in the markets in which we operate. And from that, it enabled us to drive high margins off the back of it. So we see continued improvement on that side.","William L. Meaney","One thing, Scott, just to give you a bit of extra flavor to that is that what we're talking about is in terms of the current portfolio. But the other side of it, which we always say on the International side, is that we're constantly adding new -- well, I shouldn't say new markets, but new acquisitions in the pipeline. So as we -- it's a portfolio play if you will. So in other words that if we look at our most pure market [indiscernible], the markets where we've established some key positions that Rod had alluded to, is those returns already mimic what we see in North America, for instance. When we actually enter a new market and -- or build out our capacity market like what we're doing in Brazil, we see a regular input [ph] in terms of those margins over time. But we also need to understand that as we actually go into new markets that we start at one end of the spectrum and then build it to the other. The only thing I would just say is in all those cases, though, is we go in to the view that we have to exceed even on the initial acquisitions our return on -- our hurdle in terms of return on capital. But over time, even beyond the initial returns on invested capital, we see the returns start mimicking what we get. North America hasn't hit those market leading positions if that makes sense.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Switching up a bit. Service is still moving along. I've realized a little bit of headwind for paper prices. Could you speak a little bit to trends you're seeing with retrievals, with construction? And then also, evident to the special project, that could be picking up, and historically, I think you view that as potentially a precursor for more activity in the business and including [ph] the storage. Just any color you can provide along this line.","Roderick Day","Yes, I mean, we did see some moderation in the rate of decline of service activities as we ended [ph] second half of 2013. And that continues. And as we worked our way through into Q4, I think we're nervous about calling it a big fundamental shift in the business in terms of a change in trend. But at least, there was continuation of a slightly more positive sign through Q4.","William L. Meaney","Yes. And then coming, Scott, to your question about DMS or related service and how it drives storage, I think that there's kind of 2 parts to that. I think, first and foremost, is that our customers are much more interested in solutions that we provide around their whole information management requirement, hence the reason why, over a year ago, we started going to a much more vertical process in terms of how we align our sales force to our customers. We've talked about that on previous calls in terms of the industry verticals that we had. And one of the main reasons for that is to be able to address for our larger enterprise customers those requirements that they have around a total solution. So there, you're absolutely right. I think, especially in emerging markets, we have seen a very strong link in terms of providing those services in additional storage. But I think this is -- it's very much related to our vertical strategy in addressing a solution around information management beyond just storing the physical document or electronic information.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Storage rental internal growth this quarter decelerated to 1.0% [ph], which is below your 2%-plus growth in prior quarters. Is this something we should be concerned about?","Roderick Day","I think what we saw in Q4 was there was a number of pricing actions that we took around some contract wins and some contract renewals, which resulted in a number of payments that we did announce that will be made in the beginning of the contract. We sort of had a slight dampening effect in Q4. I think for the outlook for 2014, we're expecting to get back more to the sort of 2% range we've seen historically.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then switching gears to the Wholesale Data Center business. Could you just give us a little bit of color there in terms of initiatives? How much capital you have planning -- are you planning to allocate, how much customer commitments you have lined up?","William L. Meaney","Okay. So I think on that, George, is that -- I think we're still consistent with the guidance that we've given previously, that we're allocating about USD 40 million worth of CapEx for 2014. And the way you should think about that is about 80-20. Now the 80% of that is linked to strong or high visibility around customer commitments or requirements. 20% is, what I would call, kind of fundamental infrastructure. So we're still very much driven by making sure that we have customers that are leading the vast majority of our CapEx in that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Just to circle back to the core services. What are you modeling for paper prices in '14, number one? And then number two, was there any weather impact? Because it seems like between a $5 million headwind from paper in Q4, there was probably some weather-related impact, I'd imagine, on the service activity levels. It's probably firmer than what those numbers suggest. So I'm trying to reconcile why we're headed into, call it, a bottom, when it seems like fundamentals are improving pretty steadily there.","Roderick Day","Maybe I'll start with the paper price. We're not calling really any up or down on that but started off as paper. We saw $133 a ton [ph] in Q4, baked in [ph] our projections. We're going to project that forward as opposed to making extrapolations up or down. SO obviously, if it was to improve, that will good. If it goes down further [indiscernible] is the negative. So that's kind of how we view the outlook. In terms of service...","William L. Meaney","Yes. And Kevin, on the service side, we did see some weather-related impact. It's the winter that keeps giving in the Northeast, especially tough on, actually, throughout the country. So we have seen some of that, but we don't try to project much into that. I think that the -- I think that's fair to say. But I think also, if you unpack our service revenue to a certain degree, as Rod said previously, if you look at the, what we would call, kind of the retrievals and re-files, which is the kind of the core part of our service revenue, we do see a flattening out of the decreasing trend in that part of the business. The paper trend as -- is probably the biggest single impact in terms of our service revenue for Q4, which Rod highlighted, down from previous year, associated with some specific projects, which are related to our document management services. But you're right to call out that weather has put a certain amount of headwinds on our service revenue in Q4.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Understood. And then, hey, Bill, in terms of the REIT, when is the last -- like what's the last day of 2014 where it can be retroactive to the first of the year? So I guess, said another way, what date does that PLR need to come in where it can still be effective for all of 2014?","William L. Meaney","I was waiting for a question on the REIT. We finally got it. It's in actually, I believe, October 2015. Rod will keep me honest, because it's when we actually have to file our return for 2014 with all the normal conventions. So it's roughly, I think, October 2015. Is that -- Rod, do you agree with that?","Roderick Day","Yes, yes.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then just one other thing on that. It looks like on the outlook, you pulled, for lack of a better word, in the Q3 slide deck, kind of the outlook at 2014 to 2016 across the REIT related and other expenditures. Now it's all coming into 2014. What drove that change? Is that just better visibility? Or any -- or am I overanalyzing anything there?","William L. Meaney","I think you're probably overanalyzing it and anything there [ph]. We're just now showing guidance for 2014. And then assuming that we have a positive ruling from the IRS is there will be ongoing REIT costs associated with not just supporting the normal recording for a REIT but also as we convert more countries from a TRS to a QRS. So I think you're overanalyzing. We're just showing the guidance now for 2014.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Helpful. And then what if -- if you do the E&P, would that be similar in mix in terms of stock versus cash as what you did the first time?","William L. Meaney","Yes, yes, exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to go back to storage rental internal growth, which decelerated like a point to the 1.3. I know you anticipate it to go back to 2, 2.5 for 2014. I just don't see why the type of pricing that you're talking about, initial pricing on contract, would only affect one quarter.","William L. Meaney","I think as Rod kind of alluded to on the first thing, Andrew, was it was related to a few specific large customer renewals and retroactive decreases we had to give associated with that, which we took the impact in Q4. So it's a -- very specific around a couple of large customers. And so we have visibility going out for the rest of the 2014 and can -- those are much more one-off adjustments.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And when you're in the renewal environment, even if you have to make those type of adjustments retroactively, are there price escalators built into the out years of the long-term contract that you're seeing recently?","William L. Meaney","It depends on the contract, Andrew. But you're right to say that, generally, we use the escalators that are high to CPI. But it depends on how long the contract is for and it's a mix. But generally, what you're saying is correct.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, when we talk about the fourth quarter, that's mostly just that price retroactivity that you just talked about. When you look at volume growth for storage internal growth, is there much change there?","William L. Meaney","No. Actually, the volume growth remains on track. It clearly is related to a couple specific, large contract renewals.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And Rod, if you'll entertain this question because I get it a fair bit. It's about AFFO. And I know we talked about it at last Analyst Day, and the company presented around that. When you look at the company free cash flow guide of $300 million to $340 million, what factors should investors take into account when trying to calculate AFFO?","Stephen P. Golden","Andrew, Steve here. Look, you're talking about a couple of different things. But the biggest differences between what kind of a basic AFFO would and the way we report our free cash flow is obviously taxes. It is a full burden of taxes in our free cash flow does not exist, to a large extent, in an AFFO calculation. And additionally, the AFFO only subtracts out maintenance CapEx from the cash generated by the business. And in our free cash flow calculation, we subtract maintenance CapEx, as well as normal growth and other sorts of things, excluding the real estate. So those are the 2 big differences between the 2 cash flow base number.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just -- I know the figure that we used in the past when talking about maintenance CapEx, but is the definition for AFFO different than Iron Mountain's previous comments, older comments on how much of your CapEx is maintenance CapEx?","Stephen P. Golden","No, not really. The definition should be the same. We will -- in a REIT scenario, we will likely report it slightly different. We'll indicate what portion of that maintenance CapEx refers specifically to real estate and what portion refers to other on non-real estate assets. This should remain the same.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the Cornerstone acquisition, and I understand that the -- usually, the first stage of the acquisition is go ahead and integrate it in order to get the cost synergies. But I was just wondering if there are initiatives right now to kind of broaden the tail space over there and to try and go after the end market, which is not historically kind of a paramount end market?","William L. Meaney","Shlomo, this is Bill. Yes -- no, I think it's the question. I think that, that was one of the key attractiveness for us on Cornerstone. There were really kind of 2 aspects. One is the operational aspect, which we've highlighted, is that -- and we're actually nicely ahead of plan in terms of being able to get that. The other part was the fact that Cornerstone had a very good representation in the middle market part of the business. In part of our realignment of strategy, which we talked about, I think on the last call and throw in some more detail on the Investor Day, was really that is getting much more focused through the 19 regions that we've set up across North America to go after that middle market, and Cornerstone fits very nicely into that initiative. So that's where their sweet spot was.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So are you already -- you already started building out kind of the tails over there? Or are we still kind of early stages, it takes time to build the business?","William L. Meaney","No. We've already done that. In fact, we've already integrated a number of their sales people into our organization, both on the -- boots on the ground, as well as some of the performance management associated with that to go after that market. That's actually already complete.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and then just Slide 11, the $500 million to $1 billion of estimated E&P distribution, is that a total number? Or is this kind of an incremental number? Just want to understand that. For 2014.","Roderick Day","That's incremental.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So it should be a total of $500 million to $1 billion that'll come in 2014 and a similar type of mix as to what we saw years ago?","William L. Meaney","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Jefferies.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I've got one quick housekeeping question and a follow-up. So would you mind, like in previous quarters, break out North America organic storage growth versus International in Q4?","Roderick Day","We don't have enough time. We'll get back to you on it.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Another question, Recall, a big competitor of yours, reported results earlier this week. I think they had about 2.8% constant currency growth excluding M&A. Yours is probably like 1.5% or so lower in the last 2 quarters. Is there -- is that a mix issue? Is there anything else that we should be thinking about when comparing the companies? Any color would be great.","Roderick Day","Well, obviously, Recall had less storages in America compared to International relative to what I know -- what we know without bearing on the result.","William L. Meaney","Yes, yes, because you have to understand, their record, their pure records management size in North America is about 1\/10 of ours, so it's -- as Rod said, they're more biased towards the International market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just had a question around the acquisitions pipeline. And obviously, you guys did a fair number, $320 million this year. How should we expect that based on what you're seeing today? Should that annual spend be in the next digit level relative to I think it was the 100 to 150 you guys have guided on the last Investor Day?","William L. Meaney","I think that the -- Manav, I think that the guidance that we gave at the last Investor Day is the right general expectation. I think at Investor Day, coming up in March, we'll give you a better view in terms of where we think we're going to end up over the next 3 years in terms of our acquisition pipeline because we have built a pretty robust pipeline mainly focused at the emerging markets. So our focus is to primarily grow the emerging markets which tend to be smaller in size but in higher growth areas. So I think that the guidance that we gave last time, I think, still is the right general guidance. And I think we'll give you more color in terms of what the impact of our acquisition pipeline should look like over the next 3 years when we all meet at the end of March.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just on the Chinese acquisition, I mean, could you maybe just bring in the size of either that acquisition, your market, your presence relative today and what that could mean?","William L. Meaney","Yes. Actually, I just came back from China, so I can give you a little bit of an update on that, is that the -- first of all, it's a nice little acquisition. As we said, this is -- it's not massive, but it actually builds out our location across China and gives us a similar footprint as our other, what I would call, international competitors or a little bit bigger than some of our international competitors in China. So we feel pretty good about that. I think that the -- I think it's fair to say right now with our China footprint, we have a footprint that is attractive and meets the requirements of our international clients. But we're still not, what I would call, a buyer for SOEs, state-owned enterprise. And there, there are larger and local competitors that are serving state-owned enterprise markets. So right now, it's early days in China, but we feel good that we've now got a platform that, first of all, can satisfy our international customer base; and second, gives us a lot more intel on the ground in terms of better opportunities. But we're still what I wouldn't call a large book provider of services for the state-owned enterprise.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just one last one just sort of on the Recall now spinning off. Have you seen any change in strategy or more competition for these acquisitions that you're going after that [ph] at all?","William L. Meaney","I think, so far, we haven't. I mean, I know they announced a couple of acquisitions this past week. They -- I mean, they were always -- they were a good competitor before they spun out. They're, I'm sure, going to continue to be a good competitor now that they've spun out. So I can't say there'd be any change. I think that they will, I think, like us, be very disciplined in terms of the way that they allocate capital, especially now that they're a public company. So I don't see any major change or anything like that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jay Remig [ph] of Wall Street Journal.","Unknown Attendee","I just wanted to see if you could fill us in on the status on the investigation in the fire at your new warehouse in Buenos Aires and if there's any kind of indication of the cause of that fire, if they're trying to -- if there was possibly arson involved or not. If you could just kind of fill us in how that's going.","William L. Meaney","I think, first and foremost, is that we've been working with the authorities to assist in any way that we can to their investigation. So is this being led by, obviously, the local authorities. So we don't have any information other than what's already out there that has been released by the authorities. But I think it would be wrong for us to even speculate at this point. We can't really go beyond what we've said, it did have fire detection, fire suppression systems in the operation. We did have security guards on duty 24 hours, so there were people monitoring the facility. But this is clearly a very tragic event, and the only thing I would just add is that nobody spends more than we do in terms of trying to prevent these types of occurrences. But at this point, we're cooperating with the authorities. Like them, we want to find out what the root cause was.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in the queue.","William L. Meaney","Okay. Well, thank you very much, operator. In summary, we had a good quarter and wrapped up a solid year, underscoring the durability of our storage rental business. We began to execute on our recent organization realignment and advance initiatives to extend the durability of our business. This included acquisitions in both the emerging and the developed markets that will generate attractive returns on our capital as we integrate these businesses into our core and additional investments in the emerging data center business. These initiatives are consistent with our continued focus on prudent capital allocation and maximizing total return, and we believe they will support sustainable long-term growth and allow us to deliver durable returns to our shareholders.","We look forward to sharing more details with you at our upcoming Investor Day, and thank you for joining us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Austin. Good day and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We appreciate that the timing of today's call is a bit unusual for our U.S. audience as we are conducting it today from Sydney, Australia and will be meeting with some new and legacy Recall investors later today and tomorrow.","The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us\/Investors\/Events & Presentations.","Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights, press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com, under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all the related documents as one 8-K, which is also available on the Web site.","On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","Referring now to Page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2017 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the safe harbor language on this slide, and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental financial information package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report strong third quarter financial and operating results and solid progress against our 2020 plan. We achieved financial performance in line with our expectations and drove robust internal revenue growth and enhanced profitability across the business. Our results reflect the durability of our high margin storage business and improved contribution from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative, both of which have enhanced profitability and cash flow growth.","As a result, today we also announced a 6.8% increase in our quarterly dividend per share, well in excess of inflation. Even after this growth in the dividend, we expect the payout ratio to be a little below our prior guidance with the previous lower dividend per share rate.","During the quarter we made meaningful progress on the execution of our strategic plan across all facets of the business. As you know, our plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued investment in our core developed markets, expanding into faster growing emerging markets and adjacent storage related businesses such as data center and art storage, and capturing opportunities to provide new innovative solutions to both our new and existing customers.","We also achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of 3.5%, which reflects our revenue management focus and 1.3% growth in internal records management volume or prior to the effects of acquisitions and dispositions.","As noted last quarter, trailing 12 month volume growth now includes Recall volume in the base which increased by about 20%, making percentage growth figures a bit lower even though the growth in underlying cubic feet of records remains consistent. In fact, new volume from new and existing customers of 49 million cubic feet over the past 12 months is consistent with last quarter's reported figure and compares favorably with pre-Recall levels of about 43 million cubic feet on a trailing 12 months basis, which you can see in the chart in the appendix.","These favorable trends demonstrate the consistency of customer service behaviors, and importantly, these new records stay with us for an average of 15 years.","Slide 4 is a review of the highlights related to our strategic plan. In developed markets, which include both our North American RIM and Western European segment, we achieved weighted average internal storage revenue growth of 3.2% with 1 million cubic feet of net internal volume growth on a trailing-12 month basis. We are pleased with the durability of volume growth and our ability to achieve price gains in developed markets. In addition, I am pleased to report solid progress from our dedicated focus on the U.S. federal market opportunity.","We recently secured an additional multiyear contract from the United States Patent and Trademark Office or PTO. We will be responsible for relocating more than 4.5 million patent files, which includes capturing file level metadata, packing, removal, and transportation of all records to our secure federal government compliant storage facility. This contract reflects our unique ability to address the government's needs for improving the security and accessibility of government owned records with superior chain of custody and highly responsive service, while helping to reduce its operational expenses and real estate footprint.","With this award, we now protect all significant repositories of PTO's intellectual property, including their data center and continuity of operations records, their patent and trademark files in micrographic format, and their hard copy patent files.","Looking at our goal of expanding our business into faster growing emerging markets, we are at about 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, almost double the relative size from about 10% just three years ago. Progress against this goal was supported by emerging market acquisitions closed during the quarter, including the acquisition in Cyprus noted on last quarter's call and a small deal in South Africa totaling about $25 million.","In adjacent businesses, we have laid the foundation for significant expansion of our data center and entertainment services businesses, both of which have growth rates in excess of those of the traditional records management, data management businesses.","Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter we opened the first phase of our Northern Virginia data center campus in late September with the first third of that building being fully developed and more than 50% pre-leased. When adding existing capacity from our Boston, Boyers, Pennsylvania, and Kansas City locations to current and planned expansion capacity associated with recent acquisitions and Northern Virginia development, we have the potential to provide roughly 110 megawatts of multi-tenant and hyper scale data center capacity.","We have included a capacity Slide in the appendix of this presentation for your reference. We see the data center business as an area where one plus one equals three. In other words, we see our unique combination of additional data center capacity plus our deep data management customer base has an opportunity to add significant value and achieve higher fill rates. In September, we closed on the acquisition of FORTRUST, which we discussed on our last conference call.","We also entered into a sale leaseback agreement for two Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore, among the fastest growing global markets in terms of data center absorption. We expect to close this transaction in Q1 2018. After closing, we will have the ability to leverage the existing infrastructure and in 12 to 18 months time, develop up to 10 megawatts of new data center capacity in both buildings for lease to other customers. The sale leaseback structure is attractive to both us and corporate data center operators who increasingly are utilizing such strategies to refine their IT infrastructure.","Most enterprise data center facilities are over-engineered and overbuilt. We can help these companies monetize their assets as they look to focus on core capabilities whilst regenerate rental income from captive, high credit quality tenants, and develop the remaining capacity to support new customer requirements. Synergies will come over time as we build out the additional data center capacity and gain economies of scale from the existing operations. Operational costs are in place to scale up the business in these locations. We expect a double digit stabilized yield from this transaction following build out and lease up of the expansion capacity.","As noted earlier, this transaction is not part of our 2020 growth plan. That plan, which didn\u2019t assume data center acquisitions also did not assume the issuance of equity. You may have noted that at the time we announced the Credit Suisse deal, we also filed a registration statement for an ATM or at the market equity issuance plan. We think ATM issuances are prudent way to match and to fund smaller transactions that are not included in our core M&A plan. Our ATM plan can support up to 500 million of equity issuance over time, but we have earmarked just $100 million, about 2.5 million shares or less than 1% of total outstanding for the Credit Suisse deal.","Also in adjacent businesses, we acquired Bonded Services, a leading provider of media asset management services for global entertainment and media companies for approximately 57 million pounds or $77 million. This acquisition is included in our year-to-date total of approximately $195 million, of which $55 million with the cash portion of the FORTRUST consideration.","Entertainment and media companies require specialized services for protecting and preserving intellectual property whilst also making sure then can monetize it. Such as the project for MTV's 30th anniversary that we supported last year and similar relationships with major studios, recording artists and sports franchisees. Providing these customers with both physical and digital storage as well as capabilities transform content from monetization and longer term preservation in one place is ideal. Bonded also provides fine art vaults and shipping, logistics and distribution and related services through locations in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, The Netherlands and Hong Kong. And it doubles our existing entertainment services businesses and solidifies our position as the partner of choice.","Turning to Slide six. We also made good progress on our innovation agenda in moving certain projects out of the garage. We launched Iron Cloud and expanded our Policy Center offering which we previewed at April's investor day. Iron Cloud's on demand storage can be accessed through a secure connection from customers to our network of secure data center and caters to the unique security and operational needs of medical imaging surveillance video and other specialty media. Our suite of data management solutions enables organizations to manage risk by complying with industry standards and implement advanced schemes to protect against cyber attacks.","Just in a few short weeks since the launch, we have already secured a major win with an U.K. pharmaceutical company. To wrap up, we had a very eventful quarter with solid fundamental results underpinning our progress with new initiatives and the expansion of our faster growing emerging markets and adjacent businesses. We continue to leverage our deep customer relationships and leading brand attributes of trust and security to offer more technology enabled solutions as our customers continue to transform to a more digital way of working. These are early days but we are encouraged by the progress we are seeing and we will continue to be disciplined about how and where we deploy capital to accelerate growth outside the traditional businesses.","Our progress supports growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately underpins our ability to grow our dividend per share and to delever over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart Brown","Thank you, Bill, and good day everyone. We are excited to report another strong quarter of continuing growth at our core storage rental business and good progress increasing our capital flexibility through our refinancing activity. We remain steadily on track to deliver on our financial objectives and strategic goals with a disciplined investment strategy. As Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth and business durability that our board of directors increased the fourth quarter dividend by 6.8% to approximately $0.59 per share, reflecting an annualized rate of $2.35 per share, up from $2.20 per share previously.","On today's call I will provide some color on the third quarter's operational and financial drivers, touch on the implications of our refinancing activity and then cover our outlook for 2017. As we have noted previously, we will issue specific 2018 guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call in February, consistent with most peers.","As you see on Slide 7, which shows our key financial metrics, our third quarter total revenues grew 2.4% over last year or 1.4% on a C$ basis, impacted by the disposition of our legacy Australian business as well as our businesses in Russia and Ukraine. Internal storage rental revenue growth was a strong 3.5% in the quarter, while internal service revenue declined 20%. The growth in internal storage revenue resulted from our revenue management focus and continued growth in internal global net volume. That is growth prior to acquisitions and dispositions.","Our gross profit margin improved 210 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by synergies from the Recall acquisition and the flow through of our revenue management program, partly offset by $3.5 million charge associated with the recent natural disasters. In particular, our service gross profit has improved by $10 million year-over-year to $102 million. In addition, SG&A as a percentage of total revenues decreased 20 basis points year-over-year excluding Recall costs due to the benefits of our transformation initiatives and synergies.","Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter grew about 10% to $323 million. That\u2019s growth of over 8% on a C$ basis and the adjusted EBITDA margin increased 230 basis points to 33.5%. AFFO was $210 million in the third quarter, an increase of $32 million or about 19% from last year. The strong growth resulted from the almost 10% increase or $29 million of growth in adjusted EBITDA and more than funds the 7% dividend increase we announced today.","Touching on Slide 8 quickly. This shows the relative size of each product line and the contribution of our results split between storage and service and showing line of business. Over 80% of our adjusted gross profit is derived from storage activities with a 75% gross profit margin. We continue to innovate our new service and storage offerings for our customers focusing on value added services that deliver gross profit growth and we are pleased with the progress supporting our strategic objectives for developed and emerging markets.","Turning to Slide 9 and internal growth performance. You see developed markets, which includes North America records and information management, North America data management and western Europe, as well as other international, which includes our emerging markets businesses as well as Australia. Almost half of our total revenues comes from the developed markets storage business which grew internal storage revenue by 3.2%, largely from our revenue management initiatives including programs to improve customer mix. In total, in developed markets we achieved internal volume growth of 0.2% for the third quarter on a trailing 12-month basis as illustrated on Slide 15 of the appendix.","Turning to North America records and information management specifically. Whilst internal volume growth was negative 0.2%, we continue to see strong internal storage revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate North America internal storage revenue growth to be north of 2.5% with flat internal volume growth, plus or minus, as we work to optimize returns, balancing revenue management and capital efficiencies. Internal service revenue in developed markets was down 0.1% as growth in information governance, digital imaging projects, tread activity and other project based revenue was offset by lower activity in the data management and other businesses and slightly lower paper prices.","In other international, we continue to see strong internal storage revenue growth of 5%. Service internal growth in this segment was flat as we cycle over a high level of Recall [construction] [ph] projects underway a year ago. And you can see in our supplemental reporting package, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded in all segments compared to the year ago except in North America data management where we continue to invest in new product development as Bill discussed. Adjusted EBITDA margins in this business segment though continue to be a healthy 53%.","As a reminder our corporate and other segment includes overhead costs as well as adjacent businesses such as data center and fine art. Internal results are impacted by the small comparative base from a year ago as well as integration costs associated with recent acquisitions in this segment.","Shifting now to our balance sheet. We opportunistically executed several meaningful debt transactions in the third quarter which together provide increased capital flexibility and term out our borrowings that you see on Slide 10. First, we amended our credit facility with improved covenants which increased flexibility and better recognized the value of our real estate holdings thereby reducing our lease adjusted leverage ratio. Second, we redeemed 200 million Canadian dollar senior notes due 2021, utilizing revolving credit capacity.","Additionally, we redeemed $1 billion of senior notes due 2020 at a 6% rate and issued new senior notes at 4.875% due 2027. Lastly, we extended and increased our AR securitization program. In total, these actions extended our average maturity to 6.5 years reduced our average cost of debt by about 30 basis points, resulting in approximately $18 million in annualized interest expense savings. We incurred a charge for debt extinguishment cost of $48 million in the quarter.","The attractive pricing reflects bondholders understanding the health of our business and durability of our cash flows. As of the end of the quarter, we had reduced our lease adjusted leverage ratio to 5.5 times from 5.8 times in Q2 and increased the capacity available on our capital structure remaining on track with our plan to reduce our lease adjusted leverage.","Let's turn to our guidance for 2017 which is summarized on Page 11 of the results presentation. Our core guidance remains unchanged. So given where we are in the year, we are converting guidance to reported dollar or R$. Given the somewhat limited net impact of currency changes, we expect to remain within the same guidance ranges on a C$ and reported dollar basis. Given we have increased our outlook for storage internal revenue growth to be between 3% and 3.5% from 2.5% to 3%. As a result of this better growth in considering a modest benefit from exchange rate, 2017 total revenues are expected to be near the high end of the guidance range.","On adjusted EBITDA, we are maintaining our guidance range despite the delayed timing of acquisitions though still incurring integration costs, the impact of the Russia Ukraine dispositions as well as charges related to natural disasters, which were partly offset by favorable exchange rates and onetime items we highlighted in the second quarter. As a reminder, our shared service implementation costs as well as innovation investments are weighted to the latter part of the year. As a result, we expect only limited adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. Following on the strong margin improvement in 2017, we remain on track with our 2020 plan to deliver about 200 to 250 basis points of margin improvements from our underlying business as outlined at our investor day, implying an improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins of 50 to 75 basis points in 2018.","In addition, our expectation for the 2017 structural tax rate is now 21% to 22%, driven by changes in our business mix. For 2017, the increase in taxes will only be somewhat offset by the partial year benefit of the interest expense savings. Touching on AFFO guidance. We expect to be closer to the upper end of the range of $760 million, as we expect total maintenance and non-real estate investment to be roughly $150 million for the year, benefitting from better efficiencies and discipline following the acquisition of Recall. In turn, we expect an improved dividend payout ratio relative to AFFO considering also the dividend increase we have just announced.","The FORTRUST and Bonded acquisitions are not expected to have a significant financial impact this year given the partial year contribution and the integration cost associated with both transactions. Remember also that FORTRUST was partially funded by a private placement of shares to the seller, so our outlook reflects an increase of about 2 million shares outstanding, or roughly 1 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2017. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter, reflecting the hard work and discipline across the organization.","We remain well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for 2017 and our performance continues to be underscored by the durability of our storage rental business which builds our cash flow growth thereby funding investment to continue growth and returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open up to Q&A.","William Meaney","Thank you, Stuart and just to sum up. We had a very good quarter punctuated by another period with strong revenue growth and particularly strong storage revenue growth of 3.5% before acquisitions. We continue to be on track with our integration of Recall which shows through our continued growth in EBITDA margin. Based on this performance, we have pulled forward our anticipated 6.8% dividend per share increase by a quarter and even with this payout ratio of roughly 80% of AFFO, we will be below our original guidance for the year with the previously lower dividend.","We continue to make good progress in our adjacent business areas with the closing of the FORTRUST data center business in this quarter and the announcement of our agreement to purchase some of Credit Suisse's data centers. And doing all this whilst improving our financial flexibility, extending debt maturity and reducing our interest cost. With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator so we can begin Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","Good morning in Australia. Another solid storage same store revenue growth of 3.5%. You did cite the yield management system. I am just wondering if there are any other factors driving that strong growth relative to your 2016 kind of growth levels.","William Meaney","No. I mean you can see if you look at the overall business, it's the result of the volume growth that we had. And so if you look across the whole business it\u2019s positive volumes, and the revenue management together yield to 3.5%. But I think that the most -- the big difference as you say, the year ago, Sheila, is the revenue management program that we started putting in place two years ago. And it takes a while to ramp that through as contracts becomes renewed. And you can see the difference between, say, North America, from an internal revenue growth versus Europe. Where in Europe we are probably about a year behind, in developed markets as well, about a year behind from when we rolled it out in North America.","So we think there is still more to be done specifically in Europe and developed markets as those results are flowing through from the work that we did starting a year ago in those geographies. But a big part of it is the revenue management systems.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Great. And just one follow up. On the data center space, I know it's still small in your adjacent business, but you are allocating more capital there. I just was wondering if you could talk about pricing of the two acquisitions. How you look at it? Is it just on a stabilized basis or how you are underwriting it because I realize it's a competitive environment out there.","William Meaney","It's a good question, Sheila. You can probably appreciate having watched -- having you watched this phase for a while. We have passed on more than we actioned. In other words, it's an area where you have to be disciplined in terms of your capital allocation. So our first and foremost thing is to make sure that on a stabilized basis that we get the types of returns that makes sense given our cost of capital, both on an IRR and an NPV type basis. So typically what we find is that if we are doing a Greenfield like northern Virginia, you are kind of in the 14%-15% internal rate of return. And when we do the acquisitions, it is that we are pretty disciplined if we look at something that\u2019s north of 11%. So it is a little bit - it's fair that when you are buying something with revenue already attached to it, it is a little bit lower in terms of internal rate of return; but on the other side is, you are taking less risk, right. Because it's coming across with customers.","So when we look at it, we first look at it on an NPV and IRR basis and we also look at the cost of acquiring a megawatt versus what it costs us to build it out. So we kind of look at two different lenses and that goes without saying as we only focus on high quality assets. And high quality assets is not just the physical aspect of the building, but it's also that the absorption rates we see in the markets that they operate in. So we are really excited about, for instance, the Credit Suisse, and we look forward to closing that because London and Singapore are amongst the best markets globally in terms of absorption and specifically the London operation is in the [Floyd] [ph] estate, which is a great location. And Denver is also in the top ten markets. A great question.","Stuart Brown","Yes. The only thing I would add real quickly, Stuart, is that if you look at it on a replacement cost basis, which Bill touched on, FORTRUST, we paid about $13 million per megawatt. And you need to remember, this 85% lease. So that in itself is good and then the cost to build out the future capacity is actually -- that\u2019s $6 million a megawatt. So you sort of think about where the replacement cost is, we feel really good about this investment as well for instance.","Operator","The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So why are you guys not giving guidance out for '18? Again, usually you have been doing that ever since I have been covering you. Just why are you not giving it out now?","Stuart Brown","Shlomo, this is Stuart. I will take that one. Since I have just joined a year ago when we issued guidance at the third quarter. So what you are seeing is that -- and you see sort of some of the things have changed even now in terms of how the business changes from February to March. And the end of the day, we have given 2020 outlook out there at our investor day. So you have got a little bit of a roadmap to work from already. And we would be able to give the most appropriate guidance, it's really better for us to get 2017 closed out to what final results are, tax rates, things like that. So in February we will be able to give a better quality guidance in the sense of number of business decisions that have been made. So this is something we talked about really back in the first quarter already. I think actually in the fourth quarter last year we had mentioned this.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So did you say anything -- I missed something about adjusted EBITDA set up for, I thought you said for '18. Did you make any comments about the EBITDA for '18 or I just misheard that.","Stuart Brown","Yes. I mean basically I said consistent with the 2020 plan that we expect EBITDA margins would be 50 to 75 basis points higher in '18 relative to '17.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","I mean based on what I am seeing in terms of both the transformation, the integration, some of the pricing, that sounds like kind of a low ball number to me.","Stuart Brown","No. We will give more detailed guidance in February. We are just trying to lay out the roadmap with what the 2020 plan is and that\u2019s consistent with that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And can you just talk a little bit more about the North American volumes. You are negative by two-tenths of a percent, last quarter one tenth of a percent. Excuse me, this quarter one tenth of a percent to last quarter. I think you alluded a little bit to the kind of juggling between pricing and volume over there. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more?","William Meaney","Yes, sure. Shlomo, this is Bill. So I think the best way to think about it, if you look at North America and western Europe, right. Both very similar markets in terms of level of maturity. If we look at this quarter in North America rim, we had 3.5% internal revenue storage growth and in western Europe we had 2.3%. And then if you look at the volume that\u2019s made up that, is that in, as you pointed out, North America was negative 0.2% and western Europe was, internal volume growth of positive 2%. So this tells you where we are -- we are obviously a little bit ahead in North America than we are in Europe in terms of rolling out the revenue management system. We started rolling it out about a year ago in Europe. And what we are doing with the revenue management is optimizing it. For sure, when you adjust price it does at some point affect the speed of incoming volume from customers and you can see that a little bit happening in the divergence between North America and western Europe.","But at the end of the day what we are interested in is what you eat is cash. And so we are really happy with the North American results that we had 3.5% internal storage revenue growth. And that allows us to even further optimize the CapEx because we are getting more value for stakes on the shelf, if you will. So western Europe at 2.3%, I am not saying it's bad, we are actually -- we are happy with the 2.3% internal storage revenue growth but we think there is more to come. But there is some elasticity as you try to optimize that and you can see that in the North American and western European numbers this quarter.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. That\u2019s good color. And then just two kind of metrics type numbers. I want to get some color on, first, my calculation on the mature markets is, between pricing and mix. The west was 2.7%-2.8%. Stuart, does that look right to you? And then also for Stuart, it looks like ARDSO moved up both sequentially and year-over-year. May be you could give us a little color on what's going on there.","Stuart Brown","I missed the second question, Shlomo. Can you say it again?","Shlomo Rosenbaum","The second question is receivables days. It looks like they were up to me sequentially and year-over-year. So just wondering what's going on over there.","Stuart Brown","Yes. So the first question was specifically on developed markets?","Shlomo Rosenbaum","I was just looking at total company -- I mean the days that I am getting were 73 days versus 69 days for the last two quarters and if I look year-over-year it looks like it was 67 days last turn 3Q '16.","Stuart Brown","Yes. So on the -- going right to the first question. On the receivables, the receivables is up mostly in North America where AR is up and that\u2019s really driven by fewer collection days that we actually had in September in the U.S. And it was up a little bit in India as well. It was the other market where receivables are up. We had a tax law change there and so what you are seeing in India is little bit of a lag in terms of getting billing out and collections done as over a pretty short period of time. You have got an entire system in India changing to new tax regulations. So that\u2019s what's going on in the receivables. If you look at the developed markets and other international volumes which is in the appendix to the presentation, the net internal growth number there is about 0.2%.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. So we should see that reverse in the fourth quarter on receivables?","Stuart Brown","Yes. You should see some improvement in trend in the fourth quarter.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And I am sorry I have used up a lot of the time but just a pricing thing I want to confirm. Was that 2.7, 2.8 between mix and pricing sound right in developed markets.","Stuart Brown","Yes. In total that\u2019s about right. Both North America and in Europe, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please go ahead.","Andy Wittmann","Thank you for presenting the cash chart, that was very helpful. When I look at the cash chart, it looks like you took up your guidance for the year in terms of the customer inducements and customer relationship spend from $60 million from $35 million, which is a pretty decent amount, I would say. I wanted to ask you, Bill, what you are seeing in the marketplace? Was this just you guys being opportunistic on a select handful of deals or is the inducement need a little bit higher today to get those organic boxes in the door.","William Meaney","Andy, you have been watching us long enough -- it's opportunistic and you can't time these things. When the opportunity arrives, it arrives. So there is always a little bit of movement up and down in that number because it's market driven.","Andy Wittmann","Got you. And then I guess my next question was related to the Credit Suisse acquisitions. It sounds like there is already some vacancy there. Sounds like there might be a little bit more. Can you talk about the lease up plan and how long it takes to get to some level of stabilization? Maybe the way to look at it from our point of view externally is at what point do you get this to be FFO accretive.","William Meaney","Yes, it's a great question. So the nature of the Credit Suisse acquisitions because they were running these for their own [books] [ph], is think of 2018 as the year when we have to move some of their operations out, which was not data center related, and then prepare the data halls for lease. So in '18 you will see the thing slightly dilutive, and then in '19 it's flat and by 2021 it's fully stabilized. So that\u2019s kind of the -- so already by 2019 you will see that it's flat to slightly accretive and that\u2019s really the first year that we are able to start leasing out part of that 10 megawatt that I talked about. So 2018 is effectively creating the 10 megawatts.","Andy Wittmann","Got it. Thank you for that. Stuart, maybe one for you. I wanted to ask about, I guess sequentially here with the refinancing we got some benefit to the lease adjusted leverage ratio. Can you talk about the mechanics of the new credit agreement and how that had an impact on that reported results. I guess maybe the fundamental question there is, was it definitional? Was it mostly a definitional change or was there an improvement in the least adjusted ratio sequentially here?","Stuart Brown","Yes. The most important is, is that if it was definitional, there was a change in the definition and calculation. But what that does is it improves the overall capacity in terms of where our leverage is today and where the covenants are to build real capacity and your ability to fund future growth if we needed again to be opportunistic. Our overall goal is to continue to reduce our lease adjusted leverage ratio. But the way the mechanics work or the key mechanics on the lease adjusted leverage ratio is that to adjust for rent expense and capitalize that in the lease adjusted number. The old credit facility was eight times rent, the new facility is six times rent.","So we have got annual rent of around $300 million, right. That\u2019s reduced your overall leverage about $600 million. And the way -- the reason that that was done is essentially it was a backend way to give us credit for the value of the $28 million square feet that we actually own on balance sheet. The value of the real estate that we own is gone up since we lasted the credit facilities. We had to work out mechanism to give us credit for that and this is a way to do that.","William Meaney","Yes. Andy, the important thing about these ratios is if you look at our total level of indebtedness, it's actually pretty consistent with our peer group, both on the industrial REIT and belt storage and the data center REITs. You don\u2019t see a big diversion. But the important thing is now at 5.5 we have a full turn against our most restrictive covenant which kicks in at 6.5. And what we have always said is, it's less about the absolute number, the 5.5 for instance, it's more about that we would like to see 1.5 over time we would like to see 1.5 to two turns of free board between our most restrictive covenant is versus our debt, it just gives us the flexibility to steward this thing. So right now, I mean the good news is we have got a full turn below where our most restrictive covenant is and over time as we have guided to, is we will see that widen to 1.5 or better.","Andy Wittmann","Very helpful and very clear. I wanted to just go one other question on some of these matters and specifically talking around the usage of the ATM. I guess since the Credit Suisse deal is going to be funded with these fresh proceeds of the ATM, is it your intend, Bill, that you have those proceeds in the door before that closes. And maybe more broadly speaking, is the ATM going to be done under a 10b-51 plan or is it going to be at management's discretion opportunistically in the marketplace.","William Meaney","It's going to be at management's discretion depending on the marketplace. I think again, looking at our balance sheet right now, we are not going to have guns to our heads to say that we are absolutely going to use the ATM to fund the Credit Suisse. Our intention is to do that and Stuart and myself in the board will make a decision on when to use the ATM but the good thing is we have the financial flexibility. So over time I think you are right. You look at a macro level, is it wasn\u2019t a coincidence that we announced the ATM when we announced the Credit Suisse acquisition because what we said at the 2020 plan stood on its own. But we didn\u2019t have any data center acquisitions built into that 2020 plan. So we just think an ATM is the very efficient and kind of great mechanism to fund specific acquisitions such as the Credit Suisse opportunity. So that\u2019s our intention. It's to use the ATM to kind of match fund these tuck-in acquisitions that weren't part of the original plan, original 2020 plan. But again with our balance sheet we have the flexibility on timing. We are not kind of forced to draw down any of it [today] [ph].","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Cohen","This is Michael Cohen for Andrew. Just a quick follow up on that discussion around leverage and the ATM. I mean it seems like a lot of financing capacity or flexibility coming on board. I mean is there anything particular that\u2019s driving that decision for more flexibility now versus some other point.","William Meaney","I think, Michael, you can fill on this -- I think the year where we see the most relevance in the ATM quite frankly is the data center space. We feel really good at the results we have been able to build on over the last three years in the data center. We are really pleased in terms of the pre-lease commitment that we had in the Northern Virginia. So we are really seeing the proof points in the markets that one plus one equals three. So the ATM at this point is mainly focused on making sure if we see other opportunities like the FORTRUST and the Credit Suisse come down to pipe, that we have a mechanism or a tool and a tool kit that allows us to do that efficiently. So again we don\u2019t guide to acquisitions in the data center because as I pointed to out to Karen, or Sheila rather, is that we have passed on more than we executed on because we are pretty disciplined but at the same we are very pleased in terms of the traction that we are getting in that segment.","Michael Cohen","Understood, thanks. And if I could just follow one quick question around, I know we touched on this on the North America volumes. And I knew you gave some color with North America and western Europe. Did you say for North America, I just want to make sure I got this that that customer's are holding back new volumes because of pricing. Is that what I heard or...?","William Meaney","What you see is there is a relationship between organic volume growth from existing customers based on the pricing. I mean like people will determine whether or not they decide to store on side or how quickly they sent boxes in to trust to be stored depending on the price of that. Like anything else it's not completely inelastic. So we do try to optimize that and so we feel pretty good where we planned it right now and as Stuart remarked is that we expect volume going forward is as a result in North America to be kind of plus or minus with zero points as we continue to drive better results in terms of internal storage revenue growth. Because revenue growth is the thing that drives EBITDA which drives our ability to grow cash flows. It drives our ability to grow dividend. So that\u2019s really the name of the game. So since I have been in the company this is the best result that we had in North America overall, say looking at optimization.","If you look at western Europe which as I say is similar level of maturity and similar customer behavior is much stronger internal volume growth but the overall result, in other words how much price growth we are getting at the same time is lower. So we are only getting 2.3% internal storage revenue growth and going forward we will continue to look to optimize western Europe as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Karin Ford with UMFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford","First a clarification. Stuart, did you say that there would be limited EBITDA growth looking quarter-over-quarter from 3Q to 4Q and if so, just why is that?","William Meaney","Yes. Consistent with what -- the answer is, yes, that\u2019s what I said. And that the main reasons for that are higher integration cost that we will be incurring and will flow through adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter as well as then the fact that the shared service cost of some of the innovation spend is backend weighted. So those are two main causes. The timing of acquisitions, right. Original guidance and assumed acquisitions would be earlier in the year, so you would have picked up the EBITDA and would have incurred the integration cost by now. Obviously, you get delayed EBITDA. The other thing is you also have gotten, from a year over year standpoint, we have disposed of Russia and Ukraine. It isn't sequentially but year-over-year basis.","Karin Ford","Right. Got it. And the $3.5 million of disaster expenses, what line item is that in on the income statement?","Stuart Brown","That is in corporate and other from a -- it's sitting in CFG. Sitting in sort of the corporate overhead costs. I am sorry, in cost of sales.","Karin Ford","Okay. Great. And then just last question is, to sum the revenue management topic, I know you said you still think you have some more wood to chop there and you are going to get some more benefit from there. But once you get at sort of rolled fully through and get your system where you want it. Is that kind of a onetime benefit or do you think that that will help elevate core organic revenue growth going forward?","William Meaney","It's a great question. We think the level that we are talking about -- if you look at 3.5% for the North America, we think that we can continue to maintain kind of north of 2.5% going forward. So there is a little bit of catch up but for the most part we feel really good that customers understand the value equation that we provide and they understand that that\u2019s kind of an appropriate level of price increase for them. Which will just naturally over time increase our margins as well. So we feel pretty good that we can continue to push that through. I think where we still have probably the most wood to chop, as I said is Europe and developed markets. I mean we already have started chopping that year, year and half ago but it just takes longer to because visible.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Congratulations on the dividend boost. So you are kind of 235 existing this year. If we look at kind of the equity issuance into '18, do we maintain the 235 or is it goal to kind of keep it at the 220 that it was throughout all the 2017? Or would there be a step up commensurate with the equity issuance to keep it at that 235.","Stuart Brown","We would intend to keep the dividend rate the same, right. It's very consistent with what we said even back at investor day in terms of passing the synergies and transformation benefits back to shareholders. If you look at the dividend payout ratio, it's actually improving from what we have put out in the original guidance. So we have got plenty of capital to continue to fund the ongoing business and as Bill said, if we do think sort of our outside of the plan like the data center acquisitions, we would look to fund that either through ATM or we also have, or at least opportunities to sell some of our existing real estate to fund data center growth.","William Meaney","Yes. Just to be clear, Kevin on that is, it's very [consistent] [ph] dividend per share. So we are very focused on growing dividend per share and we only increase dividend per share when we know we can maintain that as we said we are able to do that and at the same time improve our payout ratios as a percentage of AFFO.","Kevin McVeigh","That\u2019s helpful. And then just going back to the pricing a little bit. Bill, so if we get to kind of 2.5, if you would, is there kind of a certain level we should think about where the unit volume growth settles. So if there is kind of a tradeoff, does that get to kind of 50 basis points of decline so it's a net two, or any thought around the sensitivity because as you price the price right it looks like the new volume growth has slowed a little bit. Does that -- is there an acceptable range? Is it 50 basis points of decline or anyway to think about the sensitivity of price to volume.","William Meaney","Kevin, just to be clear, what we are talking about is internal revenue volume of storage growth. So that\u2019s net of any pluses or minuses. So when we said we did 3.5% in North America, that\u2019s assets are tracking out to 0.2% volume. So when Stuart guided that next year when you feel really good that we are going to be north of 2.5%, that\u2019s 2.5% net of any up or down in terms of volume. So that\u2019s including that. So at the end of the day which we guide on and focus on is internal revenue storage growth because that\u2019s what you eat. Right. That\u2019s what drives the dividend per share growth.","Kevin McVeigh","I get that. I guess I am just trying to figure out is it, hypothetically would it be three percentage points of price that gets offset by 50 basis points of volume decline that gets you in that 2.5% or.","William Meaney","No. No. I mean you don\u2019t see that now Kevin. If you look at the overall company, is we are up in terms of volume growth and up in terms of revenue growth on an internal basis. So, no, you don\u2019t get those types of swings.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Just wanted to follow up, just on items that were, I guess you would say taken out of the garage, Iron Cloud and Policy Center. Is there a significant startup cost on those items that, or is it going to be flowing through over the next several years as you try to grow those business. And can you give us just a little bit of color on that and how we should think of it.","William Meaney","It's a great question Shlomo. First of all, as we look at both of those things, a lot of the original startup cost has already been come through. There is a little bit more development that we still have to do or we are doing on Iron Cloud to add more features to it. But that\u2019s kind of on a go forward basis. I mean where I see the bigger investment in both of those things is on the go to market side which typically have a shortage of patient period. I mean if we see an opportunity to ramp that up, we will talk about that on guidance in February for '18. But specifically for those two, most of where I would call the development cost, a little bit still ongoing which is about say building out more features, is pretty much done. And you have seen that in the lower service margins, in the EBITDA margins in data management process which was a reflection of some of the expense that we have done to launch Iron Cloud but still it was 53% but it's lower versus a year ago. But I think if we do make investments in either of those areas next year, it's more in the go to market side.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And what you talked about [adjacent] [ph], I mean I am just trying to think about what are you looking for because there are newer things that you are rolling out and clearly when there is a go to market and something like that, there is an investment that\u2019s going to show up on the numbers. When you are looking for a return on something like that, like what's the time that you expect to see like a material return on something like that.","William Meaney","These things are pretty quick, right, because of just the nature and the size of the investment. And then if you look at pure market investment is that you are definitely getting a payback within two years and in some cases it's within a year. To be honest with it, the thing that we are looking at more on things like Iron Cloud because the market interest, and we have been getting a lot of positive feedback from some of the technical analysts on these things is it's more like the question is, is it something we can build and also do we need to use partners to really execute -- to take advantage of the opportunity. So those are kind of decisions we are going through. But on the go to market side you generally see fairly quick payback. It's definitely within two years and lots of times within the year that you make them.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

My name is Kimberly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Marsden, you may begin your conference.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Kimberly, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for the company. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and discuss elements of our new supplemental reporting package. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2014 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, Slide 2 of the supplemental reporting package, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those on our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in these supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William L. Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. This was a good quarter for the company, highlighted by the receipt in late June of the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and our conversion to a REIT.","As we've said from the beginning of the process, we believe we fit well as a REIT due to our sizable real estate portfolio. We have a very attractive business model, through which we incur occupancy costs on a square foot basis and generate storage rental revenue on a cubic foot basis. This significant spread between our cost and our return on investment generates high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders.","We also distinguished ourselves through low turnover costs per square foot. We have no TIs, or tenant improvements, required if a customer terminates and we bring in another customer's records. We also have a low customer churn of less than 2% per annum as well as maintaining high quality receivables giving our service to 950 of the Fortune 1,000.","The REIT structure complements our strategy whilst enhancing payouts and it highlights our highly disciplined approach around asset allocation. As a REIT, we expect to continue to generate the cash flow necessary to support attractive stockholder return and to invest -- to sustain the durability of the business while continuing to identify opportunities for enhanced growth in line with our long-term strategic plan.","We also see the potential to purchase a significant portion of our leased real estate over time, thereby reducing our cost of debt and enhancing residual values.","The recent roadshow presentation available on our website addresses many of the common questions related to our conversion. So we're not going to spend a lot of time on that in prepared remarks today. Rather, I'll focus on what we're seeing in the business and the progress on our strategic plan and then Rod will cover financial and operating specifics whilst directing you to the relevant sections of our new supplemental reporting package.","Turning now to financial highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $787 million, up 4.4% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted OIBDA of $242 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 per share, up roughly 5%. These results were in line with our presentation during our Investor Day in March and demonstrate the same growth rate on a like-for-like basis, both as a C-corp as well as now as a REIT. We maintained our high adjusted OIBDA margins for the total enterprise of roughly 31% during the quarter, with consistent performance in our North American segments and international margins in line with our targeted level in the mid-20s percent range.","In addition, we achieved solid operating results and are making good progress on our strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high return business in developed markets, having added a net 1.3 million cubic feet of internal growth in the first half of the year in North America. Moreover, having reached 12% of our sales coming from emerging markets by the end of Q2, we are on track to our goal of having 16% of our sales from this high-growth segment by 2016. Finally, we continue to identify and test new and emerging business opportunities as well as further scaling of our data center opportunity.","Total storage rental revenue, the key economic driver of our business, was up 5.7% in constant dollars, driven by strong growth of 14% in our International business and constant dollar growth of 3.3% in North American Records and Information Management, or RIM.","Storage rental internal growth of 1.6% for the quarter reflected solid growth in Records Management volume of 1.7% in terms of internal growth and 7.6% if we include acquisitions year-on-year.","We continue to see improvement in retention in North America, where a total records management storage volume outflows dropped to 6.6% from 6.8% in the first quarter and 7.1% in the fourth quarter 2013. We are pleased with this progress, as the reduction and terminations supported by our first quarter of net positive volume growth in North America Records Management since 2011.","Importantly, we maintained strong North American Records Management margins of more than 38% during the quarter through ongoing productivity enhancements whilst continuing to invest in strengthening customer relationships and product development.","In our internal -- International business, constant dollars storage rental growth was about 14% overall, with 32% constant dollar growth in emerging markets. These emerging markets, which, as I mentioned, represent just 12% of our total enterprise revenues today, have very favorable growth dynamics. Emerging market storage rental internal growth was 12% in the second quarter whilst volume expanded by 10% excluding acquisitions, or 33% in total, reflecting the successful integration of acquisitions completed in 2013.","Acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy overall, with a particular emphasis in these high-growth markets. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities in emerging markets, with more than 3x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of growing this part of our business to 16% of total revenue by the end of 2016.","We evaluate acquisitions in terms of how they can both further our market leadership and sustain the durability of our business after first establishing that we can exceed our cost of capital and achieve our targeted returns.","During the second quarter, we completed a few small customer acquisitions in the U.S., as well as tuck-in -- a tuck-in acquisition in Brazil and closed the previously announced transaction in Poland, bringing us to about $60 million of company acquisitions and another $10 million of customer acquisitions year-to-date.","Within our emerging business opportunity area, we are pleased with the early interest in our data center operations. We have booked more than 70% of the inventory space we developed in our underground facility and are kicking off our next phase of development there.","Additionally, we have signed our first few small deals in our data center near Boston, which we just completed last month. It is early days, but we have a good pipeline building up. Our targeted segment of the data center market has good growth dynamics and the potential to generate very attractive returns, and we will continue to employ a success-based approach to investment as we look to scale this business.","For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued solid constant dollar storage rental revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the 4% longer-term goals we've discussed in the past. We expect consistent trends with what we're seeing for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets and a moderation in the rate of activity-based service revenue declines. We are on track to make emerging markets, which achieve low-double digit internal storage growth rates, a more significant portion of our overall sales mix.","And in our emerging business area, we continue to identify and test opportunities which are complementary to our core business and resonate with our customers.","Overall, Q2 was a very solid quarter, anchored by our favorable REIT news and further progress on our strategic plan. We believe we are on track to deliver against our 2014 goals, as well as our longer term objectives. As a reminder, those are to: deliver shareholder total shareholder returns in the range of 8% to 9% in line with the S&P 500; provide predictable earnings and dividend growth with low volatility; and generate further upside over and above the 8% to 9% returns from our investments and additional emerging business opportunities.","Currently, it is interesting to note that we are well on track with this overall goal given our current dividend yield of approximately 6%, combined with our growth in OIBDA of 5%, or what translates loosely into a total shareholder return, or TSR, of 11% plus any upside from emerging businesses.","The REIT supports these goals as the yield component is now a bigger contributor to our targeted returns and supports our capital allocation approach.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.","Roderick Day","Thanks, Bill. In keeping with our conversion to a REIT, we have begun to transition our financial disclosure to provide information that we believe will be useful to both current investors, as well as potential new investors.","Going forward, rather than issuing a standalone press release and posting slides, supplemental debt statistics and GAAP reconciliations on the website, we will provide all these disclosures in 1 comprehensive supplemental reporting package. We anticipate enhancements to this package over time and would welcome your feedback.","With that, let me direct your attention to the financial highlights on Page 7. We delivered solid results in Q2, which were supported by strong storage rental growth, good profit performance and the benefits from recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets.","Total reported revenues were $787 million for the quarter, up more than 4% compared with $754 million in 2013. Both gross margin and adjusted OIBDA were up approximately 4%, in line with our strategic planning goals.","Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA in 2014 includes $3.6 million of costs associated with the company's 2013 restructuring and $3.9 million of ongoing REIT compliance costs.","Adjusted EPS of $0.41 increased by about 5% from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2013, which was restated to be on a comparable basis using our current structural tax rate of roughly 15%. For both the quarter and the year-to-date, we booked sizable discrete net tax benefits associated with the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and assets related to our conversion.","Just a bit more color on this. Tax accounting for C-Corps requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future expected tax impact of temporary differences between our tax basis and our financial reporting basis.","As a REIT, instead of that booked to tax difference being reflected at our U.S. federal tax rate of 35%, it is now being reflected at 0% for the portion of the business that is included in the REIT and the QRS, or qualified REIT subsidiary structure. This is effectively a onetime reset of our deferred tax liabilities and assets and resulted in a large noncash benefit.","While we no longer -- while we'll no longer be taxed at the U.S. federal level on our QRS income, we will continue to pay local tax on our international operations, including in those countries that were converted to the REIT structure. And of course, we'll continue to pay taxes on our global service operations and certain state taxes. But the REIT structure allows us to effectively repatriate storage-related income from the REIT countries and distribute it to stockholders without double taxation. While our structural rate for year-to-date came out to 15%, we continue to believe that a rate in the 17% range over the long term is about right. For the full year in 2014, we expect the structural rate to be between 15% and 17%.","We have normalized FFO to adjust for these one-off tax effects as well.","Another highlight from this page is our summary of our investments in capital expenditures. As you can see, due to the nature of our storage rental business, maintenance CapEx per foot is very low. Maintenance CapEx of roughly $30 million year-to-date is running slightly behind the $90 million midpoint of our full year guidance, as we typically see in the majority of CapEx improvement projects undertaken in the latter portion of the year.","Other CapEx is right in line with the $50 million midpoint of the full year guidance, and real estate investment, including racking, is on pace with our full year expectation of around $200 million.","Turning to components of revenue growth on Page 8. On a constant dollar basis, revenue is up 4.4%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5.7%, while service revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by recent acquisitions, as well as fees from new inbound volume and increases in imaging projects and shredding activity. On a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was 4.6%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5.5%, and service revenue growth of 3.3%.","Also on this page, you can see that we continue to demonstrate improvement in net volume growth in Records Management, with total year-on-year volume growth in the quarter of 7.6% including acquisitions, or 1.7% excluding acquisitions.","As we've noted previously, despite secular trends in the use of paper, we continue to see very consistent trends in the amount of incoming volume from our existing customers. In addition, we had increased contribution from acquisitions year-over-year and further improvements in the level of terminations and withdrawals, particularly in North America, as Bill highlighted earlier.","On Page 10, we present components of growth on a segment basis. As you'll recall, in the first quarter, we amended our reporting structure to align with the way we manage the business. We broke down our North American segment into North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, North American Data Management or DM, an emerging business, which are currently a component of the corporate and other segments.","Q2 segment results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. North America Records and Information Management delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of about 38%. We also improved capital efficiency, with spending at 4.3% of revenues, excluding real estate.","North American Data Management storage rental was flat. Service declines continued to reflect the trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as the business becomes more archival. However, we maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of more than 60% in this segment despite the reduction in revenues.","The International segment continues to generate strong growth, with 14% constant dollar storage rental and 11.6% constant dollar growth in services, driven by recurring imaging projects.","International business continue to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s target, with adjusted OIBDA margins of 23.8%. This is slightly down on the previous quarter, as a result of phasing of acquisition integration spends.","Finally, corporate and other revenue was up 9%, reflecting growth in data center service revenues. As Bill noted, we're building out our pipeline in the data center business, so these comparisons are on a very small basis.","On Page 17, we provide reconciliations from net income to FFO and then show further adjustments for noncash items to arrive at AFFO. Our FFO and AFFO figures reflect the deferred tax benefit resulting from the flushing entry that I mentioned earlier. If you were to use the Q2 normalized FFO as the run rate for the second half, or $118 million times 2, and add it to the year-to-date FFO of about $225 million, you will arrive at about $460 million of FFO, consistent with our full year guidance. A similar approach to AFFO revealed about $600 million for the full year. As mentioned on our reapproval call, with our projected ordinary dividend of $400 million to $420 million, we have strong coverage for our dividend relative to AFFO.","Turning to some of our new disclosures. On Page 18, we present storage net operating income to provide a closer look at NOI from our records management and data management storage operations. We have also added a summary of our global real estate portfolio on Page 19 to show owned versus leased buildings and the associated facilities counts in square footage by major region.","And on Page 20, we provide square footage of racked space by product type: records management, primarily the bulks business, and data protection or tapes. NOI per racked square foot, on this page, highlights the attractive economics that we derive from our real estate, which Bill mentioned earlier.","On Page 22, we provide utilization for our records management and data protection businesses. The top portion of the page shows the trailing 5-quarter trend in both cubic feet of records and data protection tapes stored, as well as year-over-year growth.","The bar charts towards the bottom of the page show the total amounts of installed racking we have in these 2 businesses and the capacity we have for racking, assuming our buildings were all fully racked.","The utilization numbers below are the cubic feet of records or number of DPUs stored, expressed as a percentage of the racking we have in place and as a percentage of what our maximum rack capacity could be.","As you can see, our utilization rates are quite high. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum utilization is in the mid-90s percent. Bear in mind that in the new facility, we would generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years. We have some upside here, as we enhance the utilization through acquisition integration and facility consolidation over time.","On Page 23, we show service business detail. This presentation has been updated from what was provided in our recent roadshow presentation. Effective July 1 of this year, we established CRS service entities in each of our identified REIT countries, which included transferring the designation of some employees who perform services in our warehouses that were previously categorized as storage-related. The transfers of these of these employees in REIT countries resulted in a shift of about $7 million of labor expenses, previously categorized as storage rental labor to services labor. We expect similar minor transfers of storage rental labor costs in the future, as we establish CRS service entities in any future REITs countries. So the basis for year-over-year comparisons will generally not be the same.","We have provided a look at our customer base on Page 24. This highlights our StrongBox retention of around 93%, as well as the diversification of our large global customer base. We also provide sales, marketing and account management and customer acquisition costs, which we think of as similar to typical REIT turnover costs.","Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 25 and 26 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. At quarter end, liquidity was virtually unchanged from Q1 at about $536 million, with $170 million in cash and $390 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.1x, which is at the high end of our targeted range, has increased over the past 3 years, as planned to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to our REITs and recent acquisitions. We expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range of 4x to 5x in the short term, due to costs associated with the REIT conversion.","We do have extraordinary expenditures remaining in the first year of conversion, including: about a $130 million of cash associated with a special distribution, assuming the midpoint of our range and today's share price; another $85 million representing the bulk of the remaining tax recapture payments, due to the change in our depreciation schedule; and another $30 million of REIT conversion costs.","If you were to look at 2014 on a normalized basis, absent these costs, and grow the components of free cash flow into 2015 at our expected growth rate and adjusted OIBDA, our excess cash available for investment, after paying our ordinary dividends, more than covers core real estate investments, including racking and leasehold improvements.","Should we be more opportunistic about acquiring buildings outright or buildings associated with business acquisitions, we would look to borrow at our targeted leverage ratio or, perhaps, use equity to fund such investments. Given the returns we can generate from leveraging our scale and global platform, such financing would be a good use of capital.","Lastly, on Page 28, we have provided components of value, which is a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation.","A couple of things to note. We present storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether leased or owned. We also provide our total rent expense in the liabilities area. We are currently showing investment in buildings, racking and acquisition at book value, but it's our intent to -- ultimately, to provide a schedule of these investment categories with our expected returns.","This schedule is followed by comprehensive definition of terms, which we believe will be helpful to investors to adjust to our new disclosure.","In summary, Q2 was a good quarter, supported by sustained storage rental performance, continued high levels of profitability in our North American segments, and strong international and emerging market performance.","And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Bill, internal growth and storage rentals this quarter increased about 1.6%, which is up from the prior quarter's growth of 1.4%, but still is below historical 2% growth levels. Can you discuss your outlook for internal storage growth and what potential catalysts that you can see that can drive further acceleration?","William L. Meaney","No, I think that, as we said last time, we weren't guiding for an immediate rebound to what we saw last year. But I think you have to look at the total picture in terms of the volume growth that we generated. Let's say, this is the first quarter since 2011 that we had a positive volume growth in North America. So there is a balance to get in terms -- because what we're looking for is total revenue, not just on the pricing front. I think, in terms of -- on the price, I think the -- it's an area in a low-inflation environment that we continue to work on and optimize further. But, I think, we're still where we were last quarter, which we are slightly improved from where we were 3 months ago. But we're saying it's more of a gradual improvement to expect rather than a rapid rebound to the 2% that you referenced."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Right. And turning to services. Internal growth this quarter reflected some lower project fees in customer terms in North America. Do you think this is a secular trend, or do you expect a rebound in internal growth and services next quarter?","William L. Meaney","I think there is 2 bits, as you know, on the service front. There are things that are, what I would call, core services that related to our records management and data management business, and then there is the project side. And the -- I wouldn't say they're secular. You're right to call out that the change in trend on the service revenue side is driven by a drop-off in some project -- large projects that we had last year. But projects in their very nature are lumpy, and it's not -- the fact that some of those haven't been replaced at the same level in this quarter is not a trend, it's rather just the nature of that part of the business. In terms of the other part of the business that we've been calling out as having headwinds, which is related to our core services around data management and records management, there we do see a flattening out of the headwinds, if you will. But, I think, in terms of the thing that was driving the major change in this quarter was the lumpiness of some of the specific projects that we do to service some of our customers."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","All right, makes sense. Rod, you've indicated you expect an effective tax rate of about 17% on a go-forward basis. Can you detail how taxes will play out in the remainder of the year and what you expect cash tax savings to be taking into account differences between book and cash taxes?","Roderick Day","Yes. So in terms of the rate that we expect, we had 15% in Q2, as I said earlier. The range that we expect for the remainder of the year will be between 15% and 17%. The reason for the slight level of uncertainty is that we obviously still pay tax on our overseas operations within those countries and also within -- on the service activity that we have within North America. So depending on the mix of the business, that will drive some small variation in the amounts of tax that we have to pay. So therefore, we do see a range, if you like, between 15% and 17%. In terms of the cash tax saving, I'd say the sort of simple way to think about that would be, if you say historically we used to pay 39% and we're now down in the sort of 15% to 17%, that would be sort of the ratio to take as the kind of key driver of change. We will, as I was saying though earlier, have to pay additional tax associated with the slowdown in the depreciation of our racking, and that will come through this year. It's not part of our normalized tax rate, but it will impact our numbers this year."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And you're still expecting cash tax savings of about $120 million per year?","Roderick Day","Correct, yes."," Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, you've indicated you're accelerating your acquisition plans and plans to own more strategic real estate over time. Can you detail how you plan to finance these growth plans and if there will be a need for capital raises near term?","Roderick Day","We are still working through the details of that, because the key thing for us is, obviously, to finance these in the most effective way. The likelihood is that we will finance some through debt and some through some level of equity, but we will structure this in such a way that we can generate the maximum level of returns for our investors. And we'll provide more details of that, as we work our way through that later this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just following-up on one of George's questions, special project activity in the service area. There has been a belief in the past that, that can be an indicator that business is picking up or slowing down. And you mentioned it's been lumpy. Do you guys take any readthrough from what you're seeing right now, or do you just stick more with the view of the lumpiness and it's not really a foreshadowing of things to come?","William L. Meaney","No, I don't think it's a very good leading indicator for, Scott, on the activity levels. So the nature of these things, for instance -- I think one of our larger projects last year was for a mortgage company, because they had certain things that they were actually selling and repackaging to someone else and we had to go in and help them, which both scan and organize a number of these documents. So it's that kind of lumpiness of activity. It's usually related to either a on-boarding of a major customer that has some specific needs or a major customer doing some kind of transaction that requires special services. So it tends to not have a very good correlation with, I think, any leading indicator. So it really is a one-off type project. Now given the -- it's even probably more lumpy than you see, when you look at our business from an analytical standpoint, but given the scale of our business, some of those lumps smooth out, but it really is of that kind of nature.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And then with regard, primarily in core storage and we'll group shredding in as well, could you discuss the pricing environment and the competitive environment, and what you're seeing out there?","William L. Meaney","I think that the -- I think it's fairly stable. I think that, if anything -- if you look at -- I think it was on Page 8. If you look at the trends in what's happening, I think that we don't see, I think, additional pressure on that. I think what we see now is, what we euphemistically call the power of the mountain, is we've got a lot more focused in honing our commercial skills. And as a result we are doing better both on defense and offense. So if you look at the trends from a year ago until today, you'll see that we've done better both in terms of sales, so out there winning by about 300 basis points over the whole period that we've got graft, and we've improve our defense by about 80 basis points. So I think that the -- I wouldn't -- and if you look at that in an environment where we're still pushing revenue -- positive revenue growth, are we making some trade-offs? Maybe, but a lot of it is also the segments that happen to be addressing, both in terms of the countries we're going after and the customers that we're going after. So I think, net-net, I don't see a major change in the competitive market other than we're using the power of the mountain or the scale that we have for the benefit of our customers, I think, much more fuller or much more comprehensively. I think the only thing that's a challenge in the low-inflationary environments that we have is price is always a challenge. Because most of the countries that we operate in, at least ones that we have any significant size, are in low inflationary environments and putting price increases through, and those types of environments is always difficult.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just you cited that chart on Page 8. I'm curious, over the coming year or 18 months, where do you think -- excluding acquisitions from the discussion, which of the buckets there do you think will show the most change? I can tell ideally which ones you'd like to move the most, but which do you think will have the most significant moves?","William L. Meaney","Well, let's look at the chart. If we look at Q2 '14, just so we're just looking at the same numbers. So let's look at the charts by color chain [ph]. So if you look you look of the dark blue block just above the line and the right red black just below the line, I think those things are going to tend to run in similar trends. Although the light red, to me, also tends to have some lumpiness, some of that is to do with legal holds coming on or off, so you can have some movement around that 4.7. But I think, generally, that's what we would call the organic growth of the business. So I think, as I've pointed out previously, that independent of everything else, even though paper itself is in decline, document growth -- new document growth from existing customers tends to be in the 6% to 7% range, which is the dark blue block, and I expect that to stay in that range. That gets netted out, because customers are going through different life cycles with their inventory and that's been bouncing around the 4.5% to, say, 4.7% range. And I would expect those -- so I expect those 2 to be relatively stable going forward. I think the -- lets leave the acquisitions out, because that is -- we do have an acquisition strategy, biased more towards the emerging markets. But I think what you're really referring to is: what's the organic growth health of the business in terms of things that are -- that's more incremental? So I think then it really comes down to you asking, are we going to do better or with the trend in terms of new sales, which is the lighter blue or the kind of medium blue bar, 2.2%; and our defense, which is the out perm, so where we are actually are losing business, which is dark red, of minus 2%. To say that we're going to continue on a certain trend line, I'm not going to guide for that. The only thing I would say is that, I think, the improvement that we've highlighted, I think we should be able to hang on to in that order of magnitude of where we're taking is -- we're quite encouraged by a couple of things that we've done with our commercial operation, both in terms of the way that we develop products now and take advantage of our global scale, not just local scale, in terms of getting insights in terms of what customers find helpful in terms of our product and solution delivery. And then the other part of it is, is that some of the reorganization of our sales force that we've talked about a few quarters now, both in terms of the verticalization, which again, gives us better insights in terms of solutions that our customers are looking for. And that seems to be resonating where you see in both the better -- in trend both in new sales, as well as defense. And then the last aspect is, is that we are boosting our presence in the middle market. Our presence in the enterprise part of the segment has been strong for many, many years, but we're now also trying to have a similar representation in the middle market. So again, I think there is lots of things that underpin that we should be able to maintain those kinds of trends, but I'm not guiding for major increase in either of those.","Roderick Day","Bill, it's interesting points you make there. One sort of addition I just want to add is that we have service revenue associated with our perms and terms. And as they've decreased in the quarter, that actually had impact to our service revenue in the quarter. And it's a negative as it were on service, but it's a positive for the longer term of the business.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And, Rod, just one other thing. And I like the new presentation, by the way. On Page 24, where you show North America revenue by vertical, that pie chart, what is that? Is that the end of 2013? Is that as of June 30? And could you give us a feel for, maybe over the past few years and maybe looking forward to some activity you're seeing in the verticals, how might that pie chart change?","Roderick Day","Yes. So the numbers refer to sort of year-to-date '14, so it's kind of the latest view. I think what you'll see is that, as we sort of develop out our vertical strategy and really look to drive specific areas, we would expect some shift in this chart, although it's likely to be slow, just kind of given the annuity basis of our business. So the kind of areas where we do see potential, for example, would be federal, which is one area where there's plenty of unvended [ph] activity for us to go after, the whole area, the life sciences, energy and business services, very interesting new areas for us to be getting after. Legal and financial insurance, historically, we've been very strong in those segments. We'd expect to continue to bolster our presence. But in terms of potential relative to some of the other segments, it's probably less. So I would suggest. But would you agree with that, Bill?","William L. Meaney","Yes, I think that's a good summary. The only thing I also would add is in the other category, a lot of that is the middle market. And we have roughly 20% share of wallet in the middle market where we have, say, 60% share of wallet in the large enterprise market. So I'm not saying that we're going to get to the same share of wallet. But we do feel, like the federal market, that we're underrepresented in others. So how those things move out? But I would say that -- I agree with Ron saying as we're well represented in kind of the Big 3, so to speak, legal, financial and insurance, not that we wouldn't want more business there. We are constantly pushing. But we do have some areas like federal, and, I would say, the middle market, and other where we're underrepresented and we think there's real opportunity.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","One more, if I can sneak in, then I'll turnover. Just the one topic you didn't hit in that category was healthcare. I'm curious if you're seeing anything changed on that front?","William L. Meaney","It's a good question. We do normally talk about healthcare, so I'm glad you brought that up, Scott. We have -- we continue to be pleased with what we are seeing the swap-out, or the change. Because, obviously, the electronic medical records has affected our service revenue in healthcare probably more than any other vertical, as more and more of the healthcare records have gone online. That being said, we've been able to increase our storage revenue in healthcare by taking in more records. So we have year-on-year storage growth of almost a little less than 1%, which goes to that trend. So they're not destroying the records. In fact, we're getting more records as they're cleaning out the hospitals as well. In storage, as you recall, has about 2x the margin that service. So healthcare continues to be a major focus for us. We are also finding through these conversations, which goes back to Rod's comment about the verticalization, is we're gaining further insights on how we can service them even beyond the traditional, what I would call, medical record area. So it is an area where, I think, innovation is actually helping us, especially shifting us to higher-margin work.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You talked about the activity service revenue declines narrowing. I remember this activity-based moving boxes around, moving tapes around being a drag for many years. I think it might have started in 2009. My question is: why do you feel now is a time where these activity service revenues are starting to even-out, and do we think that's kind of sustainable?","William L. Meaney","I think that the -- well, there is kind of a couple of things. One is that we're still seeing -- if we look at the 2 businesses, Andrew, I think it's worthwhile to look at records management versus data management, because data management, we still are seeing probably stronger headwinds in terms of getting to a, what I'll call, a stable floor than we are in records management. And the reason for that simply is that we're still finishing up the transition from tape being for backup and recovery to tape being an archival product. Right? So our storage volume, it continues to grow in the DM business, but how tape is being used is different. So as a result, we're doing this transition to a different service model, which happens to have a lower activity associated with it. And the thing I should highlight is, we are able to maintain our margins pretty closely during these drops in activity. So it's important to understand that it's an activity-driven. Whereas on the records management side, the data that we're looking at, we are further down that cycle, if I will, that transition to a more archival nature. So things like I was highlighting in healthcare, healthcare traditionally was a high-service business because it had a lot of, what we call, active file with medical records going backwards and forwards between the hospitals and our facilities. That obviously is gone away, or going away, fairly quickly in most locations. So I think in records management, that trend to archival nature of our services is further ahead, and we see that decline flattening out. So that's what we're really -- where we're looking at. At some point, it does get to the transition from active to archive you get through 80%, 90% of the transition, and I think that's where we're at with the records management. And we are -- I think we're well down that journey with data management, but we're not as far down the journey as we are with records management.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And do you think we'll ever get to a point where the service revenue, activity-based service revenues, could be flat?","William L. Meaney","I think, relatively, it's -- I think that it's probably going to kind of go up and down a little bit. I think the -- and it depends on what we replace some of that service revenues. So some of it is where we're replacing -- we're cannibalize our own backwards and forwards transportation, if you will, by providing them scanning and online options to retrieve data as well. So the part of it is, is we're also providing different ways for the customer to get the information back that's more efficient.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifle.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the real estate side of things. In terms of potential lease buyout, does your portfolio have any particular amount to favorable purchase options versus market value? Is there anything in there that's particularly attractive if you go through the portfolio, like a certain percentage of them?","Roderick Day","Yes. I mean, actually on Slide 27 of the supplement, so it gives you a sort of the profile of how our leases look to expire. And what this shows -- if you look at the top chart, it shows when the leases come up, the sort of first expiration, as it were, and then the bottom is what would happen if we were to extend our leases into the longer term. And so the reason why there is such a difference is that when we've taken out lease agreements, we have typically looked for very long-term leases. So we've always kind of had that option in there for us to be able to extent. So the first point, I guess, in terms of our ability to buy, is we are long-term tenants. People see us as long-terms tenants. And we try to sort of structure that within our lease arrangements. And so then the second thing we try to do, not with all leases, but with certainly a significant number, is indeed to incorporate elements as sort of buyout clauses within there, which should work to our advantage. So we have a purchase option immediate -- so a good approach is an option of around sort of 6 million square feet, and that should be at good terms for us. And we would look to move forward on -- so any elements of that. We will always do this in a way that creates value for shareholders, but that's kind of where we stand today.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So is there an arbitrage opportunity in your portfolio, your lease versus buy, in terms of market value? That's just what I'm trying to get it","Roderick Day","Yes. No, for sure. So if you think of it, typically we might borrow around 6% -- the lease rate, if you like, would be around 8%. So you've got a 200-basis-point spread as a sort of general rule.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Basically, let me just restate what I'm trying to get at it, is there -- I'm saying, in terms of the purchase options, will you be buying real estate at below-market prices when you exercise those options? That's an actual, but more what I'm getting it.","William L. Meaney","I think the way to think about it is just reemphasizing what Rod is saying. Because we have fair market clauses in most of our leases, virtually almost all of our leases when we renew, that allows -- so the way you have to think about it is it's the cost of financing is how you create value, it's not the arbitrage in terms of being able to get something at a lower price. So I think the better way to model it or to think about it is that 200-basis-point spread, which is around the financing cost of 8% to lease, 6% to own, right? Because I wouldn't try to build in us being able to buy at a better price. I think where the arbitrage comes in, potentially, is on the residual values. Because what we're capturing, especially in the emerging markets which we are -- in my previous life, I played this out a number of times where we used to buy real estate purposely because we could capture, in 15 or 20 years, the urban growth to capture additional residual value. So that's a longer-term capture. And I think you have to also do it as a backdrop. When we say leases is that a number of our leases -- as I say, these typically are very long leases. So it -- in fact, if you look in places like Asia, you typically can only buy leaseholds, but you are able to get, effectively, the full economical ownership. In fact, in some markets, you can even get this part of the residual value because of your ability to trade leases. That's not in very country, but in some countries you can do that. So that's what we're really talking about is how do we actually take some these long-term leases where we have a lot of the economics of owning, and how do we further capture it? And I think the best way to think of it is the 200 basis points of potential spread between cost of ownership.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So if I just take that further, so to the extent that you will issue equity in order to affect either lease buyouts or property's M&A, the immediate impact on a lease buyout would be the 200-basis-point spread and that should be accretive to investors on a cash flow basis? Is that the way to think of it?","William L. Meaney","I think -- I'll actually let Rod speak, but I think what Rod's saying, it will be a blend, most likely. I mean, that's the one thing that we're working out is the blend between equity and debt to do that. So it will be on a blended basis.","Roderick Day","So that's right, Bill. But certainly, we aim for the -- I think to the point, we are aiming for the investments to be accretive. Correct.","William L. Meaney","Yes.","Roderick Day","Yes.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I mean, the other part of that in terms of, I think people are kind of getting to this, is in terms of potential equity issuances, is that how fast should you deploy or raise additional equity? How fast would you be able to deploy that in terms of being able to increase your FFO per share and AFFO per share? In other words, do you think there'll be a lag time of 6 months, or you'd be doing it kind of at the money as you need that type of stuff and so you'd make it immediately accretive?","Roderick Day","I think it would depend on the speed with which we could effectively acquire the leases, if I'm answering the question. So it will be -- it will depend on that phasing. So we wouldn't -- obviously, we wouldn't be able to buy all our leases on sort of day 1, but we would have -- we would expect to have a program to do so over time.","William L. Meaney","And I think -- look none of these things -- it'd be wonderful if we could do something today, and it's absolutely accretive the next day. I mean, these things -- we look at allocating capital on net present value basis and an earning per shares basis over stabilized returns, and we look at how long it takes you to get there versus how much you have to take in early. I think that the ability for most companies to be able to time these things exactly is never there. But I think it's fair to say, emphasizing what Rod's point is, is that if we go out and raise equity, for instance, it will be with a clear visibility and understanding of how that becomes accretive for the shareholders. But to say that you can do these things matching on a one-to-one basis instantaneously, I think we're not saying it can't be done, but I would say right now that it's hard to see how to do that. That being said, whatever we do, we'd be -- we would have the transparency around it with our shareholders and investors that how that is accretive in terms of their interest in the company.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then just kind of a housekeeping question on Slide 28, in the annualized NOI. Could you just, maybe Rod, walk us through a little bit what you mean exactly for a stabilized portfolio versus the NOI that you would be reporting on a quarterly basis?","Roderick Day","Yes. So the way to think about the stabilized portfolio is, is a kind of like-for-like. So where we -- so we're kind of excluding acquisitions and buildings that would have come out of that portfolio. It's just kind of like core, if you like, within that.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So it's going to exclude racking that's not fully utilized? I'm trying to just...","Roderick Day","No, it's the buildings as opposed to the racking. If we sell a building or acquire a building in the period, we wouldn't include that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Dolev with Jefferies.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a really quick data point. Two questions on Slide 8. Sorry if I missed that. Are those LTMs or are those quarterly figures?","William L. Meaney","Those are LTM.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And I don't know if you've mentioned it already, but would you mind giving the data point on how this would look like on a North America record management, like you did in the last few quarters? Those same metrics, but on a North America basis?","William L. Meaney","Yes, I highlighted that in my remarks. If you go back -- I think you'll see that I went through. For instance, in North America, we added 1.3 million cubic feet of internal growth in the first half of this year.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So but you didn't specify those specific -- the things that make up the buyer [ph], you did not specify that specific what's organic versus disruption, et cetera, for North America, right? Like the equivalent of Slide 8 for North America?","William L. Meaney","Yes, what I can give you is, for instance, is that below the bar, for North America, was minus 6.6%.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the...","William L. Meaney","Which is a minus 6.7% in this one. And we can give you the numbers on above the bar. But what the North American -- so the North American below the bar is a little bit better than what it is on a consolidated basis. And then in terms of the net volume growth, before acquisitions, in North America, as I said, we added 1.3 million cubic feet.","Roderick Day","Which is 0.3%. So you kind of got a minus 6.7%, you got a plus 7% on...","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right, it improved. On an LTM basis, it improved versus Q4 and Q3 of last year. It's an improvement?","William L. Meaney","Actually, yes.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A session. Presenters, I would now like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.","William L. Meaney","Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we had a strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of Iron Mountain, as well as our renewed commercial focus in delivering, what we call, \"the power of the mountain\" to our customers through harnessing our scale in product development and solution delivery. We demonstrated progress with our strategic plan in several areas. We are getting more out of developed markets, with solid improvement in volume and improved trend in internal growth. We are building our business in emerging markets and continuing to drive strong organic growth there. And our conversion to a REIT is driving improved returns, enhanced disclosure, and we believe over time an expanded shareholder base.","We feel very strongly as a real estate company, the REIT structure enhances the value to our shareholders. And we're committed to driving attractive returns through continued expected growth in OIBDA and, ultimately, FFO and AFFO of about 4%, and believe the durability and stable growth in our business will support growth in our dividend, in line with cash flow growth over the long term.","Thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Marsden, SVP of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Bonnie, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings conference call. As Bonnie noted, I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, and I just joined the company's IR team a few weeks ago.","This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our new CEO, who will discuss highlights and the early focus areas; followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2013 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can also be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, in addition to today's press release.","With that, I'd like introduce our new CEO, Bill Meaney.","William L. Meaney","Thank you, Melissa. It's great to be here today. I've had the opportunity to meet with several of you since joining the company in January, and I look forward to getting to know our investors and analysts over the coming months.","Before I get started, I'd like to just take a minute to welcome Melissa Marsden to Iron Mountain. Brian and his team have been working with Melissa as a consultant for some time, and she officially joined us in her current capacity as Senior Vice President of Investor Relations earlier this year. Melissa brings more than 25 years of Investor Relations experience across a range of industries, and most recently, she served as Managing Director of IR of ProLogis, which, as some of you probably know, is the global leader, the largest global industrial REIT, where she was named the top REIT IR officer by Institutional Investor. So we're very pleased to have Melissa here and the capabilities that she brings to our team as we work to expand Iron Mountain's investor base.","Now that is the introduction to Melissa. Let me just kick off with a couple of comments on our performance, and then Brian will cover the details in a few minutes.","Iron Mountain wrapped up another solid year, with revenues of $3 billion and adjusted OIBDA of $912 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, all in line with our expectations.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to achieve strong constant dollar storage rental growth of 5%, underscoring the long-term durability of our business and providing a sturdy foundation for our overall financial performance. Our storage rental revenue growth reflected both healthy increases in our International business, as well as steady growth in our North American business, and offset a modest decline in our total service revenue, which was driven mainly by lower recycled paper prices.","These stable fundamentals are what attracted me to Iron Mountain, namely a track record of durable growth, strong cash flow generation, high return opportunities in the international market and a great franchise with a strong culture. While many companies experienced wild swings in revenues as global economies peak and trough, Iron Mountain has the unique ability to sustain its growth rate throughout business cycles due to the attractive underlying stability of our storage business. I did my due diligence, and I believe we can sustain the durability of the business through opportunities in both the mature and emerging markets, as well as potential adjacencies. Be assured that as we pursue these opportunities, we will continue to view them through our capital allocation approach, which focuses on maximizing cash flow, generating strong returns and supporting the steady long-term growth of our core business.","My near-term focus upon joining the company is to spend a good deal of time with customers, investors and our associates around the globe. I came away with a sense of opportunity related to the significant amount of unvended records that remain in the mature markets in both private and public sectors.","One way in which we are addressing that is organizing our sales efforts into vertical segments such as health care, financial services, energy and government and a closer alignment between our sales and product management groups. It's early in the process, but we are pleased with the progress to date. This sector focus and Iron Mountain's strong customer relationships should, in time, give us permission to handle more data in record management processes for our customers and provide some higher value-added services.","Additionally, Iron Mountain has an internationally recognized brand, yet only about 1\/4 of our revenues today are generated outside North America.","Overall, many of the emerging markets are still early in the records outsourcing process, supporting our continued expansion in international markets, which is a great fit with my background. I spent the last 27 years running multinational businesses from outside the United States, and I'm very comfortable with the process. To be clear, in my view -- in the view of Iron Mountain, international expansion is not about putting pins in the map. We will pursue entry into additional markets with an aggressive yet disciplined approach that is consistent with our focus on return on invested capital and where we can develop leadership positions over time.","We are on track to achieve our goal of 700 basis points of International margin improvement by the end of 2013. Entering to new markets may flow further International margin expansion slightly in the early stages of market penetration, but as we've demonstrated in the past, once we achieve market leadership, our International margins are very consistent with those of our developed markets.","Lastly, we look to invest where we can leverage the brand and build off our strengths but in areas that are adjacent to or directly tied to our core operational expertise.","At Investor Day, Richard Reese talked about the opportunity for wholesale data centers, where we can provide the secure space and customers bring in their own technology. He highlighted that we are already doing this in our underground data center operations, where we're approaching a run rate of some USD 20 million in annual revenues, with substantial space to further expand. This is just one example of where customers came to us and asked for a specific product or service, and we'll continue to look at additional opportunities consistent with our core business.","The combination of our durable leadership position in developed markets, emerging market opportunities and close-in adjacency provide a very solid foundation. I'm very confident in our ability to build on this position and to maintain steady, stable growth and strong cash flow. In short, I think we've got a great base from which to continue to drive sustainable value.","Beyond the opportunities to sustain the durability of the business, I was really attracted by the nature of the organization. It's not often that one gets a chance to lead a company that has the kind of franchise that Iron Mountain does. The strength of our brand and the depth of our customer relationships, in my opinion, are unparalleled. The culture is refreshing and apolitical, something that is exceedingly rare in a global company. There is deep operational know-how, what I like to call the secret sauce, and its customers trust us with their critical documents, and it's what enables us to innovate and discuss with our customers how we can do more to improve the efficiency of their records management.","There's also an overarching objective of driving returns through smart and disciplined capital allocation with a focus on long-term and sustainable growth. Assuming that we are successful with the Private Letter Ruling, or the PLR, the REIT will complement our core strategy and provide further certainty in our investment focus, resulting in a source of stable and growing shareholder returns.","Financially, we will have the flexibility to fully support high-return investments to expand our network capacity, pursuing tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities, as well as acquiring real estate. We'll also retain the flexibility within the REIT test to expand closely related service opportunities as well.","As we move through the PLL process -- with the PLR process with the IRS, we are working hard to advance our preparedness to operate as a REIT. We have invested heavily in people, processes and systems to enable us to be ready for conversion at the beginning of next year and are targeting the third quarter to have our REIT-critical systems in place.","This aggressive timeline results in additional investment, which Brian will review, but this is the right time to invest to ensure we're dotting our Is and crossing our Ts. We're making a significant investment but one that pales in comparison to the incremental shareholder value we expect to be able to deliver as a REIT.","As we continue to work on the REIT conversion, we have been familiarizing ourselves with various REIT sectors and their characteristics. In terms of the nature of our business, we believe that Iron Mountain is most like the self-storage but with an important difference. We are enterprise storage serving 94% of the Fortune 1,000 as opposed to consumer self-storage, which has a very different credit profile.","In terms of other characteristics of the business, I think we believe we compare favorably with an attractive cash flow characteristics, low volatility and low risk. For example, in terms of cash flow, we have a much higher annual rental revenue per square foot, roughly 2x that of the self-storage sector, where we're approximately $27 a square foot versus $13 to $14 for self-storage.","We also have similar low maintenance CapEx to self-storage at roughly 6% of our storage rental gross profit, and we have similarly low tenant improvements required when a new customer moves in.","If we look at it in terms of volatility and comparing ourselves to the self-storage market, we have a very stable storage rental growth of plus 4% to plus 7% versus self-storage, which is ranged anywhere from minus 5% to plus 9% over the past several years. We also have very high customer retention rates of 98% compared with only about 55% of self-storage customers who stay more than one year. On top of that, the average life of a box in our storage rental business, as most of you know, is about 15 years.","In terms of the risk profile of Iron Mountain's business versus the self-storage business, we have a very high-quality, diversified customer base serving 94% of the Fortune 1,000 and we have more than 155,000 customers globally, whereas self-storage has retail or individual consumers as customers with variable credit quality.","So we look forward bringing you the specifics of these and other metrics, as well as our thoughts on Iron Mountain's valuation as a REIT, over the coming quarters.","In summary, we are executing against our business strategy and are well positioned to deliver against our financial objectives in 2013. Our storage rental business is strong. We have meaningful growth opportunities available to us to extend the durable storage annuity, and we are making good progress towards delivering the REIT.","Before I turn it over to Brian, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Richard Reese for his innumerable contributions to Iron Mountain. Many of you have come to know his candid and thoughtful style, and I believe the culture of the company is due to his influence and leadership over the past 30 years.","As we met with investors over the past month, many of you expressed your thanks to Richard for his stewardship of the company and his willingness to return during a difficult phase in the company's history. He will be missed, and I have truly appreciated his insights in the short time that I've gotten to work with him here. I know you'll all join me in thanking him and wishing him well.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brian.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Bill. Let's turn to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid operating performance in Q4, driven by consistent storage rental growth. Storage rental grew 5% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by consistent gains in North America and 12% growth in International, including benefits from our 2012 acquisitions in Brazil and Europe.","Overall, growth trends were similar, with reported results constrained by lower service revenues. As expected, we saw about $3 million of negative impact from lower year-on-year recycled paper pricing, however, the impact was less than we've seen in recent quarters, and we've worked through the lapping of the significant price declines that began in Q4 2011.","Adjusted OIBDA was in line with our full year guidance. Our profit results continue to be supported by International margin gains.","As reviewed in our Q3 call, we saw impacts in Q4 from costs associated with accelerated facility transactions and a realignment within our sales and account management organizations, as well as from the true-up of accruals at year end.","Overall, we finished the year on track with our expectations, supported by solid storage growth, strong International gains and continued efficiencies in capital investment.","Today, we are reiterating our full year 2013 financial outlook for revenues, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow. We're increasing our CapEx guidance to reflect the recent facility lease buyout and the relocation of our Boston headquarters that was announced after Investor Day.","Additionally, we're updating our preliminary outlook for our REIT conversion costs to reflect a more informed view of the expenditures required to complete the project, particularly with respect to the International convergence. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline, including having our REIT-critical systems operating in third quarter of this year.","Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2011. As noted, Q4 results were as expected, supported by 5% constant dollar storage rental growth. Enterprise revenues grew 2% on a constant dollar basis as our International segment continued to drive strong performance. International posted 10% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 4% internal growth and benefits from our acquisitions in Brazil and Switzerland. North America posted flat constant currency revenue growth as a lower service revenues offset 2% storage rental gains.","Foreign exchanges had a minimal impact in the quarter. Gross profit was $420 million in Q4, yielding a gross margin of 55.4%, down 210 basis points compared to the same prior year period.  Storage gross margin decreased 120 basis points, reflecting costs related to accelerated facility transactions in the U.K. and in the Southeastern United States. And service gross margins were down year-over-year due to decreased recycled paper prices and impact from lower core service activities. Mixed impacts from 2012 acquisitions were also a contributing factor.","Adjusted OIBDA was $207 million or 27.2% of revenues in Q4. Our underlying profit performance remained solid, supported by continued improvement in our International segment. In Q4, this improvement was offset by the negative impacts from the costs associated with the facility transactions I just described, the realignment within the sales and account management teams in North America, the integration of our 2012 acquisitions and the impact of year-end cost accrual true-ups. Lower paper prices and lower service activity were also contributing factors to year-on-year decline in adjusted OIBDA.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.20 per share compared to $0.33 in Q4 2011. The decrease was primarily related to lower adjusted OIBDA and increased interest expense related to our recent debt financing transactions in support of shareholder payouts and the REIT conversion.","Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.07 per share.","Reported earnings per share of $0.15 includes $18 million of REIT costs, $6 million of losses in asset dispositions and $2 million of other expense.  These impacts were partially offset by the impact of a lower effective tax rate due to foreign currency losses and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 40%.","Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q4 and full year growth rates were in line with our full year expectations.  For the quarter, constant dollar growth was solid at 2.5%. Overall, constant dollar growth for the year was at the midpoint of our 0% to 2% range, including the impact of lower paper prices. Excluding these effects, constant dollar growth for the year was a solid 2%.","In Q4, storage rental grew 5%, driven by consistent performance in North America and continued strong growth in our International segment. North America reported 2.4% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat Records Management volume and consistent pricing trends in the 1.5% to 2% range, with some additional benefit from solid data protection storage rental growth. International storage rental constant dollar growth was 12% for the quarter, reflecting sustained double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia-Pac and benefits from the 2012 acquisitions.","Total services decreased 1% as expected headwinds in North American activity-based services and lower paper prices more than offset solid DMS growth and benefits from our 2012 acquisitions. Overall, North America service revenues declined 4% in the quarter, with 1% of that decline related to paper. Gains in DMS revenues were offset by decreased core service activity levels and lower revenues from special projects and ancillary service lines, including film and sound and fulfillment services.","The International segment posted 8% service growth supported by acquisitions.","In terms of components building to overall growth, storage rental internal growth at 3.2% for the quarter showed an improvement, as expected, compared to Q3.","Net global Records Management volume was up 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. Service internal growth was minus 2%, and total revenue internal growth was roughly 1%. Acquisitions and foreign exchange changes combined to add about 1.5 points to our reported results -- growth results.","Overall, our storage rental business remains durable, providing consistent results and a solid foundation for our overall revenue performance.","Let's take a look at our storage rental performance over the last 12 quarters on Slide 6. Slide 6 shows our constant dollar storage rental growth over the past 4 quarters to the enterprise, as well as for our 2 operating segments. The stability and durability of our storage rental business drives the economics of our business. We've now reported 24 consecutive years of storage rental growth. As you can see in this chart, since 2009, our constant dollar enterprise storage rental growth has averaged 4% per the quarter while ranging between 2.5% and 5%.","North America, which generates approximately 75% of our storage rental revenues, continues to deliver stable growth of 2%. Our strategy here is to sustain this level of growth by capturing opportunities in the unvended market and underserved verticals such as government. As we outlined at Investor Day, our target growth rate for North America storage rental is between 1% and 3%.","Our overall storage rental growth is enhanced by our fast-growing International segment, which has averaged 9% constant dollar growth over the past 3 years. This performance is supported by strong organic growth and more recently, additional growth through acquisitions.","In the more developed International markets, we'll  continue to support the growth of the annuity as we are in North America. In addition, we'll look to expand in high-quality, high-growth emerging segments. Over the next 3 years, we expect to drive 5% to 9% storage rental growth overall in International.","Our long-term focus is to sustain the durability of our storage rental business as the key driver of our overall economics and the foundation for the long-term growth of our cash flows.","Let's now take a look at our full year profit results in Slide 7. Slide 7 looks at our full year performance compared -- for 2012 compared to 2011.","In terms of our key financial metrics, we delivered results that reflect consistent business trends and the achievement of our financial goals.","Reported revenue for the year was $3 billion, up 1% on a constant dollar basis, as solid storage gains offset impacts from lower recycled paper prices and declines in core service activity in developed markets. Adjusted OIBDA was down 3% year-on-year on a constant dollar basis. Lower paper prices pressured profits by about $30 million in 2012. As noted, at current prices, we worked through these tough comparisons. Year-on-year results were also impacted by discrete costs in Q4, including facility moves, costs associated with the realignment of our sales and marketing organization and the year-end true-up of accruals. These impacts offset gains driven by strong underlying International profit performance.","Adjusted EPS was $1.21 per share, down 11% compared to 2011, reflecting lower adjusted OIBDA and higher interest expense incurred to support shareholder payouts and costs associated with the planned reconversion, which more than offset the benefits from fewer weighted average shares outstanding for the full year.","2012 capital spending was $182 million, including $54 million of acquired real estate and $13 million of REIT conversion CapEx. As a percentage of revenues, CapEx excluding real estate and REIT CapEx is 6.1%, in line with our capital efficiency goals.","Free cash flow for the year was $347 million, solidly within our guidance range, compared to $467 million for 2011. The year-on-year decrease was as expected, reflecting lower adjusted OIBDA combined with higher cash taxes compared to low 2011 levels, higher interest expense in support of our shareholder payout program and a lapping of lower cash incentive compensation payments in 2011. The 2012 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results shown here exclude $34 million of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by about $0.14. Note that 2011 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS excluded $16 million of these costs and reduced reported EPS by about $0.05 per share.","In addition to the $30 million of REIT-related CapEx I just discussed, we paid $80 million in taxes towards our D&A recapture liability. All told, these items would have reduced free cash flow by about $116 million year-to-date. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT costs and related expenditures in the appendix of this presentation.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our full year results by segment. Slide 8 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to 2011. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North America segment while continuing to build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains.","North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. For the full year, our North American business segment reported revenues at $2.2 billion, supported by consistent 2% constant dollar storage rental gains. Despite the impacts of lower recycled paper prices, we sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%. Adjusted OIBDA in North America was down year-on-year due to a decrease in paper revenues of $23 million, lower core service activity levels and costs associated with the facility transaction and the realignment in the sales and marketing organizations. We also sustained capital efficiencies in North America this year, spending at 4.5% of revenues excluding real estate.","Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenues, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 10% on a constant dollar basis. We're benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Asia-Pac. Excluding acquisition integration costs and the accelerated facility transactions in the U.K., International adjusted OIBDA margins expanded about 150 basis points this year. Benefits from productivity initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio have us on track towards our business goals of approximately 25% margins in 2013.","Finally, corporate expenses were consistent with prior year levels, reflecting benefits from overhead cost control initiatives. Overall, we continue to drive strong operating performance across our portfolio.","Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 9. Strong, consistent cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We're currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.9x, within our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio was increased over the past 2 years as planned to support shareholder payouts of $1.5 billion and expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT over that period. As we've previously stated, the costs associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily and modestly push our leverage over the high end of our range -- of our target range.","We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At year end, liquidity was more than $900 million, with $243 million in cash and $667 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our strong cash flow supported continued advancement of our shareholder payout strategy. During the fourth quarter, we paid $47 million in regular quarterly cash dividends at a rate of $0.27 per share in addition to the $140 million cash portion of our $700 million special dividend. For the stock portion of this special dividend, we issued 17 million new shares.","As we discussed on the Q3 call, management recommended and the board, at its regular scheduled meeting in December, agreed to maintain the $0.27 per share quarterly cash dividend rate rather than reduce it based on the new higher number of shares outstanding. This resulted in an increase to our dividend payout levels of nearly 10% over prior years.","We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders, and we're well positioned to fund our business plan.","That concludes our review of our Q4 2012 results. Overall, 2012 was another good year in which we continued to drive solid financial performance and position ourselves well for continued success in 2013 and beyond.","Let's now turn to Slide 10 to review our 2013 outlook. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2013 revenue, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow guidance while updating our outlook for CapEx, adjusted OIBDA and REIT costs. As we first presented at Investor Day last October, we're projecting 2013 reported revenues to be in the range of $3,020,000,000 to $3,100,000,000 or 0% to 3% constant dollar growth.  We're maintaining our outlook for adjusted OIBDA to be between $905 million and $935 million on an operating basis. Storage rental growth is expected to remain strong at 4% on a constant dollar basis, consistent with the past 2 years. Service revenue growth is expected to be down moderately, driven by consistent trends in developed markets. Based on current prices, recycled paper should have a limited impact on 2013 growth.","Adjusted EPS for 2013 is now expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.24. The change from Investor Day is primarily due to some additional D&A and interest expense, as well as to formally update for the full number -- for the number of diluted shares outstanding that we have after the E&P distribution. We provided some estimates at Investor Day, and this formally builds in the actual 17 million shares distributed. The calculation of adjusted EPS now assumes 190 million shares outstanding and a structural tax rate of 39%.","We're increasing our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $290 million, including an estimated $75 million for real estate. The increase reflects the addition of $22 million for the relocation of our Boston headquarters that was announced in Q4, as well as about $11 million for the buyout of a lease in Dallas we completed earlier this year. The $75 million we expect to spend on real estate this year includes $30 million for the expansion of our data center capacity in our Pennsylvania underground facility that we discussed at Investor Day.","Our outlook for operating free cash flow continues to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million as we expect cash tax efficiencies that will offset the net cash impact from the office move.","As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant onetime operating and capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relates to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. Total operating expense and capital costs are now estimated to be in the $150 million to $200 million range, up about $50 million from earlier estimates. We expect the majority of these costs to be incurred in 2013. We've increased our preliminary outlook in this area to reflect a more informed analysis of the conversion project, particularly with respect to the scope and timing of our international conversions. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline, including having our REIT-critical systems operating on a test basis by the third quarter of this year.","For 2013, we expect to incur between $65 million and $90 million of incremental expense, between $30 million and $45 million of CapEx and to pay $105 million to $115 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture, all in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction in reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36 and use of cash of $185 million to $230 million. We'll continue to track and report these costs discretely from our underlying operating results.","Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA as well as for the REIT-related items are included in our appendix.","That concludes our review. And in summary, Q4 was a quarter of good financial performance, and we're well positioned to achieve our financial goals in 2013. We continue to execute against our business plans, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we continue to advance work in connection with the proposed REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders.","Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Congratulations to Richard, Bill and Melissa. I wonder, Brian, just as we think about the uptick in the taxes related to the REIT, the $105 million to $115 million, up from $80 million, what was the reason for that in terms of -- was it just a tighter discussions with the IRS or just any thoughts around that?","Stephen P. Golden","Kevin, this is Stephen. No, this is just a schedule of payments over the course of time. There were -- there's more than one layer to it, and there's a small second layer coming in, in 2013 that wasn't there in 2012. So this has got nothing to do with conversations with the IRS. This is all fixed payments that just happened to be in bulk in 2013.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then, Bill, it sounded like you've had a wonderful transition so far. One thing you mentioned were potential adjacencies. Was that kind of primarily related to data storage or anything else in addition to kind of the traditional services past data storage? And would you do that organically or inorganically?","William L. Meaney","I think -- right, and the only thing that we've come out public on is the wholesale data center as a potential area for adjacencies, but so there's a number of things that we're looking at that are across all those spectrums. But I think the way to think about it is the things we're looking at is similar to when we went into the tape business. So in 1995, I think, roughly, is when we really got going in the tape business, and it was less than a $15 million business. And today, we've turned this into a $400 million, $500 million business. So I think that the question for us is what is the next natural adjacency, just like we added tape alongside the box, which has been excellent. And there's a number of things we're looking at, and the one that we've highlighted or come a little bit more public about is the wholesale data center is a potential area.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Samford of Citigroup.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you quickly on the REIT conversion and where we are in terms of the next stage of E&P distribution. Is that -- and timing or any size as far as anything that you guys have come up with so far this year?","Brian P. McKeon","James, this is Brian. What I tried to say on that, the next E&P distribution, assuming we're successful with the feedback from the PLR, which we don't have anything new to announce on that front, but assuming we're successful, it would be in 2014. So we're not anticipating a E&P distribution beyond the one that we did at the end of last year until 2014. And that's consistent with normal timing on these types of things, we have until the end of 2014 to do the formal distributions as part of the conversion process.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the tape backup and data protection segment. What's the overall mix today? I think you said $400 million to $500 million -- $450 million to $500 million. And is that segment growing, or any metrics on either growth or margin expectations on that part of the business?","Brian P. McKeon","It's -- again, it's Brian. It is growing. We highlighted that actually, North America gave us some accretive benefit to the overall growth rate. You see somewhat similar dynamics in the tape business that you do to box in the sense that the archival use of tape continues to grow, and so the storage side of the business is solid. We're also getting the benefit of a refocus within the company over the last couple of years, really post the divestiture of the digital business. So a lot of the resources that were -- sales resources that were calling on CIOs were selling a broader spectrum of products, and now they're really laser-focused on the tape business, and we're starting to see the benefit of that flowing through our growth rate. We are seeing headwinds in the tape business like we are in box in the sense of activity-based service. There's less tape rotation going on. It's more archival in nature, and so there are some headwinds there that constrain the overall growth. But it's quite a healthy business. And I think a key thing to highlight there is it is very much aligned with the growth in digital data, right? The tape is a storage format for digital information, so it benefits from the explosion and growth of digital data. So it's a very good business, very nice returns for us, and we're pleased with the progress we're making there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, the first question, can you just quantify, Brian, for us the costs related to the facility closures and how quickly do you get a return in terms of efficiency or savings going forward from those efforts? And secondly, just the rest of the other incremental. I think you said some accruals in incremental sales investments.","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, the facility transactions, there were 2 large ones. One was in London. It's basically closing one facility and consolidating into another. And we had one in Nashville, Tennessee in the U.S. And we'll see returns from those quickly, so those are basically payments we're making to get out of lease facilities and some other costs. And we'll consolidate it to other buildings, and so that's factored into our 2013 outlook. It's very quick payback. We do this all the time, so this is nothing new. We had some -- the other impacts in the quarter, the sales and marketing realignment was about $4 million. We highlighted paper being an issue year-on-year, about $3 million. And there were just a variety of things that kind of all went in one direction on the year-end accruals. We had some litigation accruals. We're still incurring some costs to finalize resolution of the government contract matter, which is progressing well, but there's a lot of money being spent there just to resolve that. We had some adjustments to stock programs. We moved to a world where we're paying a lot more in dividend, so we made adjustments to how that impacts the stock incentive programs for employees. We could basically give them credit for dividends in the future, and just some other normal noise. But those -- some total were several million dollars of impact. So a lot of noise in the quarter. When you cut through it, it was -- we expected a bunch of this, and so it's right in line with our guidance. And operationally, we feel good about the underlying performance. The International business is on track, good profit improvement in North America, sustained margins. We have endured some of the paper price swings, but we've worked through that. So we feel like we're in a good position to deliver the objectives that we outlined at Investor Day.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I'm sorry, how much specifically was the cost of those 2 facility closure charges?","William L. Meaney","$7 million, $7 million combined.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then a little more color on the sales. I know there's been talk of investments in sales beginning a year ago or so. Is this incremental on top of that in terms of a bit different strategy, or is this just continuing to execute what you've been working on for a while? And is it -- do you have any tangible sense yet how the verticalization, if that's a word, is actually working?","William L. Meaney","It's Bill. I think that it's early days, but what we did before is we did a very strong focus in verticalization around the health care segment, and based on that, we were able to see -- we were getting some good traction in gains against the headwinds that we were experiencing in health care with the drop in service revenues as people go into the electronic records. We saw that actually really worked to have people, to have sales teams that were specialized around certain vertical sectors. So what we've done at the start of this year is we've launched a number of different sectors, which I mentioned, including government, oil and gas, financial services, and doing exactly the same thing. So it's early days, but it was based on the success that we had in health care in terms of rejuvenating that business. We thought that this really is the thing that makes sense, to try to go after some of that unvended business and get more, especially in the mature markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Bill, could you talk a bit about the customer traction you're seeing with wholesale data centers, how much this contributed to 4Q results and how much you're expecting this to contribute going forward?","William L. Meaney","Well, I think that we're approaching a run rate of $20 million for 2013, and we have a number of clients or customers that mainly came to us that we're hosting in that wholesale data center. So we're in the process, as part of this realignment of the sales force is to actually be more proactive in terms of bringing in additional revenue, and that's where the investment that Brian highlighted, the $30 million that we're budgeting this year to expand that is based on sales volume. So we're not going -- we're not spending that money, hoping that people come. It is based on our expectations in terms of generating additional customers for that facility, and that's the amount that we've budgeted to actually build up a facility to serve them. So right now, it's early in the year, but we're sticking by our guidance that we're -- that's what we expect based on the pipeline that we're building.","Brian P. McKeon","And George, it wasn't a major driver of our economics in Q4, and in 2013, we're investing in the front-end capability to continue to build out this business, which we think could be a couple hundred million dollar business over time. And so you'll start to see the benefits of that flowing through more in 2014 in terms of the profit results, but right now, it's not a major driver of our profit growth. But we feel very good about the investments we're making. The incremental returns on this are very attractive. It's a great space and good execution and high end customer interest. So we feel very good about this, and I think to Bill's point, it's a business that we can meter quite well. We basically invest capital after we've got commitments and long-term contracts, so it's a good business all around to invest behind.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. As a follow-up, could you give us some color on what kind of customer activity you're seeing in the health care space, particularly with regard to the computerization of health records?","William L. Meaney","I think that, first of all, with the computerization of health care records, we're getting a lot less service revenue, which, I think, goes without saying. So it's becoming much more archival. So they're still retaining the paper records because they need that proof, but in terms of the access to the information on those records, that's being much -- more and more, that's being scanned, which is helping our scanning business. And it's -- then once it's electronic, they don't need to bring the records back and forth. Where we're were finding some new storage opportunities are things that -- which I discussed with some of you, for instance, in the pathology segment, and it's been an area that's been overlooked by a lot of the health care providers in the sense that they just stacked up these paraffin slides everywhere and also in terms of some of the tissue samples. And that's a business that we're seeing some decent growth, which is pure storage but needs to be stored under special environmental conditions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Brian, I know we're increasingly talking about constant currency growth, but I appreciate the reference back to internal growth. So when we look to 0% to 3% constant currency -- constant dollar growth for 2013, I wanted also a conversion back to organic growth. Is there any acquisition that have occurred since Analyst Day? Is FX still a very modest change, and so is internal growth going to be close to 0% to 3%? And the second question is within that 0% to 3%, how should core service fair?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, so breaking that down a bit for you, if you're just looking at internal, Andrew, is we expect storage to be about 3%, so consistent with where we are. And services to be down modestly, so it's sort of a -- the flat to minus 2% range, I think, would be a good estimate there. And that is basically reflecting the activity base pressures we've talked about in more developed markets. In the emerging markets, we're internationally seeing very good service growth, but still a significant part of our business is U.S. and U.K. So that's the breakdown. Right now, we've got about 1 point of growth in our outlook related to acquisitions, and that just reflects what we've completed today, right? So if we do more, there will obviously be some accretion to that, but that's our current outlook.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And FX?","Brian P. McKeon","FX, limited impact at this point.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And also, when you said 3% for storage and 0% to 2% for services, is that constant dollar or is that internal -- 0% to minus 2%, I'm sorry.","Brian P. McKeon","I was referring to internal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow up on Gary's question in terms of the onetime-ish type cost that came out in the quarter. You talked about facility costs and the SG&A realignment. Can you just give us the dollar amount? If I kind of onetime those things, I can pull them out and see what the underlying margin is for both North America and International?","Brian P. McKeon","So I walked through some of the details with Gary. The latter part of your question, Shlomo, I just wanted to clarify it. You're trying to understand what was International versus U.S.?","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. And just a total dollar number. In other words, is it, I think you said $7 million for facilities and then $4 million for the realignment. Is the total onetime-ish type cost $11 million? And how are they split? I just want to confirm that and then see how they're split.","Brian P. McKeon","Right. In addition to that, you had year-end accrual impacts, which are in the range of $10 million, actually. Yes, in terms of if you sum total all of the impacts. So we had a fair amount of year-end accrual activity as well. Keep in mind that you have the paper year-on-year headwind of about $3 million as well. So combined, that was the key drivers of the performance. I don't have the breakdown between North America and International in front of me. I'm sure we can follow up on that for you. We did try to normalize the International margin growth, so I'm sure you can do the math on them.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just going forward for 2013, it looks like kind of an $8 million OIBDA improvement in margin to go down about 30 basis points. Is there going to be a continued improvement, should we think, in the future, that OIBDA should continue to gradually go up? And is the margin going down because you're getting better growth on International? Is that the way we should think of it?","Brian P. McKeon","We highlighted at Investor Day that we are advancing some new business investments in 2013, areas like wholesale data center that we talked about. We've got some other areas in beta in terms of new services around our tape business and highlighted there's about $10 million of investment there. That is -- our underlying outlook for the business reflects sustaining North America returns and following through on the margin improvement that we have in International and then having moderate margin improvement post 2013. So really, what you're seeing is just a reflection of -- we are making some select new business investments in 2013, and that's mitigating some of the benefits from the International margin gains.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second -- this is the second quarter, I think, you guys have said that the storage volumes in the U.S. are relatively flat. Do you they fall into the relatively flat negative territory or relatively flat positive territory? I'm just trying to figure out, is there any trend to be seen over there at all?","Brian P. McKeon","They were down 30 basis points year-on-year in North America.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Final question. What's the Plan B if PLR doesn't come back favorable?","Brian P. McKeon","We'll share more specifics with that if that's the case, but we would -- our business strategy doesn't change. We're committed to growing the business and in improving our operations, as we've talked about it, and returning capital to shareholders. The REIT was a better way to do that and aligned with how we're managing the business. We'll bring some more specifics around that, but you should anticipate us just bringing clarity on how we intend to return capitals to shareholders in the context of our business strategy going forward, but we don't have anything specific to share with you today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So I just wanted to get your thoughts, Brian, since you've been kind of leading the REIT conversion process. Is there anything to be read from the Correction Corp.'s and GEO Group approval process? Is there anything, kind of takeaway, that those offer maybe confidence or less confidence in your conversion process?","William L. Meaney","Yes, I think they're all independent events. We don't have any insight into the dynamics in those discussions. I mean, we have our own set of facts and our own kind of proposals with the IRS, so I can't offer any insight from what's going on with others. I mean, clearly, there are more companies looking at this area, and so I think this is an area that's getting a lot of attention in terms of review. And that's -- there are other companies that are kind of nontraditional, if you will, in terms of proposing REIT structures, but our facts and circumstances are discrete and distinct, and I wouldn't read anything from other discussions into our situation.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. On the government opportunity, as I think back about how you guys have talked about the government records and that they are -- they outsource but internally. They have their own kind of document management facilities, something that has been a long-term opportunity, but probably one of the most difficult opportunities that you guys have had going after. As you re-verticalize here, are there any green shoots of success in capturing that government business? And I think in the context of austerity and fiscal cliff, maybe that's more relevant today. Is there anything to report there on early successes?","William L. Meaney","Yes, look, I think that the -- I would put it in a bucket with all our vertical visions, early days, but we are doubling down on that. And I think our view is net-net, if the government comes under tighter and tighter budget pressure, that's a net positive for us. We're in a lot of discussions at different -- coming out from different angles with different government agencies, including their own internal storage people, and they are full and running out of capital. So I think that there's -- the opportunity for us is growing, but it is an area where we're doubling down our efforts to see if we can get something to happen in 2013. It's early days, but we're optimistic. Otherwise, we wouldn't have focused on that as a separate vertical.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then maybe one final question. It's really just around the M&A environment. There's been a bit of activity here in the last year or so. I think you guys kind of forecasted that, that might be happening. Is there still more out there? And then with the balance sheet leverage at the high end and probably going over the high end of your range here with more of this conversion spend and what have you, does that keep you maybe a little bit more conservative in how you go after that M&A? Or do you feel, I mean, unconstrained by doing what you'd see as good deals?","Brian P. McKeon","We're comfortable with the strategy that we've outlined. The M&A activity that we're driving is within our core business, and the businesses that we buy, the activity that you saw, a fair amount in Q4, are smaller North American acquisitions. They tend to be highly accretive, bring very good profitability. And so actually, in terms of when you think about our leverage structure, where we've historically been kind of 3x to 4x EBITDA, when you get these businesses, they fund -- a significant amount of them fund themselves in terms of the incremental OIBDA. So we're comfortable with the acquisition kind of ranges that we've talked about. And within the kind of the normal band that we've been functioning within, I think we had an estimate of about $100 million a year in our longer-term estimates and quite comfortable we can manage that.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","William L. Meaney","Okay, well, just to wrap up, I think we delivered on our expectations for the 2012 financial performance. And looking forward to 2013, just to recap, we expect continued solid growth in the storage rental and further expansion into existing and new emerging markets on our International side. Sustained -- we don't see anything other than sustained high margins in North America and additional profit improvement, which we've already highlighted in the International business. And we'll continue to pursue these with a strong focus on prudent capital allocation, with an overarching goal for total returns and delivering sustainable value to our shareholders.","So we want to thank you all for joining us today, and we really appreciate your support.","Operator","Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, Bonnie, and welcome, everyone to our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the company.","This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and strategic initiatives; followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.","Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2013 financial performance.

The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Meaney.","William L. Meaney","Thanks, Melissa, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We're off to a good start in 2013 with first quarter financial results in line with our expectations. Total revenues were $747 million, adjusted OIBDA was $227 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.27 per share.","Operating performance also is tracking in line with our full year ranges with consistent storage rental constant dollar growth of 4.4% and storage rental internal growth of 3%.","As noted in recent quarters, we continued to see a decrease in activity-based services. These trends continue, but we are able to offset these impacts to deliver solid profit results.","I'll turn it over to Brian to cover the details of our results in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to talk about what we're seeing in our markets and some of the ways in which we plan to sustain the durability of our core business.","Since our last report to you, we've continued to make progress on many fronts and have integrated our strategic review into the budget process for 2014. More specifically, some of the areas of focus include: preparing to operate as a REIT; continue to emphasize organic growth, both in the mature and emerging markets; expanding through acquisitions which are accretive and which meet our strategic and financial hurdles; and evaluating close-in  adjacencies.","With respect to the REIT, we are moving forward with plans to build on our solid foundation and enhance our strategy. As we've said before, we can't comment on the specifics of our PLR, or Private Letter Ruling. We can say that in general, the process can take about a year, but we don't control the timing. As you know, we filed our PLR in mid-July 2012 and we continue to prepare for conversion moving full steam ahead with systems upgrades and the legal and tax restructuring necessary to move some of our International businesses into QRS. We have accomplished much, but there's more work to do.","Additionally, we continue to advance our thinking about real estate investment opportunities and how we present the attractive characteristics of our business that align well with other REITs.","As we've said previously, we have very high rental revenue per square foot and the quality and durability of our storage net operating income is exceptional, with extremely low volatility across business cycles. We also have a high credit quality customer base characterized by strong retention and relatively low maintenance and turnover costs. We believe these characteristics will continue to support the solid fundamentals of our business and will be of interest to investors seeking both attractive current and total shareholder returns.","Turning now to operations. We continued to see good growth opportunities in both our developed and emerging markets. By developed, I'm referring not only to our North American markets of Canada and the U.S., but also to Australia, Singapore, the U.K., as well as Western Europe, where our business continues to perform well despite financial market uncertainty and challenging macroeconomic conditions.","There are several ways we look to sustain the durability of the business in our developed markets. One is by enhancing our industry-specific expertise in vertical markets and adding value for customers through tailored solutions around Records Management and demonstrating how our solutions address their requirements, whether they are regulatory, commercial or operational in nature.","Another is by differentiating our core storage and service offerings with innovative tools that drive incremental storage from existing customers and attract new customers. We are encouraged by early visibility into our pipeline of booked business and active pursuits. This pipeline is slightly more skewed towards new customer relationships, demonstrating the potential in the unvended or partially unvended market.","Generally speaking, there is a long lead time between sizable new bookings and implementation, so we expect very little of this new business pipeline to be reflected in our 2013 results.","On our last call, I mentioned the realignment of our sales and marketing teams to focus on vertical market opportunities. It's early days, but we're making progress. We pioneered this focus in the health care vertical and achieved a storage volume increase of 2% year-over-year in the first quarter in North America. The growth from our higher margin storage rental revenues is offsetting expected pressures from lower margin services, impacted by shifts towards electronic medical records.","Given the storage margins are more than 2x that of service, this shift in the health care vertical has led to an overall increase in profit contribution. Additionally, we are receiving great feedback from customers who view us as their source for insight into industry best practices. We have expanded forums such as the customer advisory board and industry symposiums to bring top customers together to discuss challenges and opportunities. Based on insight from our financial services advisory board, 2 subcommittees have already been formed to help shape future products and services.","Another example of our vertical market focus is the federal government. While not a significant part of our business today, we believe there is a sizable opportunity tied to the 2012 Presidential Directive on Records Management. This directive facilitates federal agencies in better using records to assess the impact of programs, reduce redundant efforts, save money and share knowledge within and across their organizations. We recently cosponsored a study that found federal government records are expected to grow from 8.5 billion to more than 20 billion records over the next 2 years. Whilst the bulk of the new federal records are being created electronically, 41% of those documents ultimately are printed and managed in paper format, underscoring the durability of growth in the physical record storage.","Our penetration of this vertical segment is progressing slowly, but we recently completed a deal to store 250,000 cubic feet of veterans claims records with potential to add document management services. What we're finding is the federal government has historically awarded contracts to small systems integrators that don't always have the capability or the full know-how to service the business once they get it. We're seeing real opportunities to partner with these smaller integrators in order to establish our foothold in this vertical segment. Moreover, we continue to be confident that the federal government will increasingly need to outsource Records Management with the private sector, given their fiscal constraints.","In addition to our vertical market approach, we are advancing our go-to-market approach to help differentiate our core storage and service offerings and as a means to tap the unvended market. We've identified multiple unique customer types, ranging from the pure physical storage outsourcer to the workflow digitizer seeking to convert all physical records to digital and several variations in between. By customizing our approach, we can better map our solutions to each type of customer, integrating more consultative services.","An example of an offering for the sophisticated customer looking to unify records is our Accutrac solution, which enables organizations to centralize the management of both physical and electronic records, helping them find records faster and lower risks of noncompliance, as well as cutting storage costs.","Let me now turn to emerging market opportunities. By emerging, I'm referring to the BRIC countries, as well as other Latin American countries like Chile, Argentina, Central and Eastern Europe, countries like Turkey, the Czech Republic and Poland, as well as other Asia Pacific markets, such as Hong Kong. Our emerging markets currently represent about a $300 million business for us and we have significant opportunities to expand our platform in these fast-growing countries through both acquisitions and organic growth, positioning ourselves to capture the first wave of outsourcing.","In the aggregate, these emerging markets achieved storage rental constant dollar revenue growth of 30% in the first quarter or 17% when excluding our recent acquisition of Grupo Store in Brazil last year.","Moreover, we have a solid pipeline of potential acquisition candidates in emerging markets. Many of these deals would accelerate the growth of our business into leadership positions, which as we've noted in the past, is a driver of incremental margin improvement in our International markets.","As we've noted, many of these emerging markets are early in their process of outsourcing records management. We have opportunities to enhance our growth in emerging markets by leveraging the solution-based product and service offerings we originated and refined in our developed markets, where we've been in operation for much longer and implementing those programs in our emerging markets.","By helping customers early in the outsourcing process to become more efficient and reduce costs, we will become a trusted partner and ultimately drive more business.","We are also continuously evaluating close-in adjacent businesses that support our core Records Management business and meet our return hurdles, and we will continue to evaluate these opportunities through ROE, cash flow and return on invested capital filters. We have recently announced our plans to move forward with expansion of the underground wholesale data center in Pennsylvania that we talked about at Investor Day last October. Again, it is early in the process but we are encouraged by initial customer demand, and we will prudently evaluate the opportunity through this initial effort before undertaking incremental investment. Part of our investigation will include looking at the feasibility of above ground wholesale data centers on existing Iron Mountain land. We believe we can continue to deliver sustainable value and support business growth by targeting 25% to 35% of our free cash flow for investment in emerging markets, acquisitions and adjacencies. We believe this level of investment would be similar under our existing structure or as a REIT, and is consistent with our capital allocation approach through which we also maximize cash flow, generate strong returns and maintain significant payouts to our stockholders.","To wrap up, we have a great business with good momentum, supported by a strategy to sustain our growth over the long term.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss our financial results in more detail.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Bill. Let's turn now to Slide 3 which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered good operating results in Q1, driven by a consistent storage rental growth which supported solid profit performance. Overall growth trends were consistent. Storage rental growth grew 4.4% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by 2% gains in North America and 12% growth in International, including benefits from our 2012 acquisitions in Brazil and Europe.","While storage growth remains solid, we saw similar declines in query-based core service activity leading to lower retrievable refile and transportation revenues in mature markets.","Service growth declines were a bit higher in Q1, as expected, reflecting some tougher comparisons in International markets, as well as declines in storage destruction and termination fees. We expect these impacts to moderate as we work through the year.","Adjusted OIBDA was up 2% and on-track with our full year outlook. Our profit results continue to be supported by International margin gains and sustained cost controls. Overall, Q1 was in line with our expectation, supported by solid storage growth, strong International gains and continued efficiencies in capital investment.","Today, we're reiterating our full year 2013 performance outlook. In addition to our revenue and profit performance, our capital expenditures and free cash flow generation are all tracking to plan.","Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2012. As noted, Q1 results were as expected, supported by solid storage rental growth. Enterprise revenues grew 0.5% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continued to produce strong revenue performance. International posted 7% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 12% storage rental growth, including benefits from our acquisitions in Brazil and Switzerland.","North America posted minus 2% constant currency revenue growth, as lower service revenues more than offset consistent 2% storage rental gains.","Year-on-year changes in recycled paper prices and FX rates had minimal impact in the quarter.","Gross profit was $426 million in Q1, yielding a gross margin of 57%, down 80 basis points compared to the same prior year period. Storage gross margins increased 40 basis points, reflecting good cost management with growing revenues. Service gross margins were down year-over-year due to decreased revenues from the lower core service activities. Mix impacts from 2012 acquisitions was also a contributing factor.","Adjusted OIBDA was $227 million, up 2% year-on-year. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved to 30.5% of revenues in Q1, driven by lower SG&A expense, excluding REIT costs.","Our underlying profit performance continues to improve in our International segment, consistent with our plans. International adjusted OIBDA margins increased 100 basis points in Q1, as we remain on-track to achieve 25% margins in 2013.","Savings from the North American sales and account management realignment and lower stock option compensation expense were also contributing factors to the year-on-year increase in adjusted OIBDA.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27 per share compared to $0.29 in Q1 2012. The decrease was due to the higher number of shares outstanding following the issuance of 17 million new shares last November as part of our special dividend.","Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced Q1 2013 reported EPS by $0.09 per share net of tax.","GAAP earnings per share of $0.10 includes $25 million of REIT costs and $3 million of other expense, partially offset by $1 million of gains on asset dispositions. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 38%.","Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q1 growth rates were in line with our expectation and our -- with our expectations and our full year outlook. In terms of components building to overall growth, storage rental internal growth was 2.5% for the quarter, service internal growth was minus 6.5% and total revenue internal growth was minus 1.4%. Acquisitions and FX changes combined to add 1.4% to our reported results.","Overall, our durable storage rental business provides a solid foundation for our overall revenue performance. For the quarter, consistent storage rental growth of 4.4% on a constant dollar basis supported total constant dollar revenue growth of 0.5%.","Year-on-year global net volume growth was 2.8%, including about 1.1% benefit related to the store acquisition in Brazil.","North America reported 2% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat Records Management volume and consistent pricing trends. International storage rental growth was 12% constant dollar for the quarter, reflecting sustained double-digit growth in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia Pac.","For the year, we expect overall storage rental to sustain consistent growth rates of about 4% on a constant dollar basis and about 3% on an internal basis.","Total services decreased 5% constant dollar as expected headwinds in activity-based services continued, and we faced some tougher near-term comparisons in International. These impacts more than offset solid DMS growth and benefits from our 2012 acquisitions.","The International segment posted 1% service growth supported by acquisitions, DMS growth and higher project revenues, which more than offset lower shredding revenues due to some customer terminations in early 2012. We've now lapped those terminations and should have better comps as we move forward through the balance of the year.","Overall, North American service revenues declined 7% in the quarter with about 4% of that decline related to activity-based core services. Gains in DMS revenues were offset by lower revenues from special projects and ancillary service lines, including entertainment and fulfillment services.","Paper prices had limited impact in Q1 as sorted office paper pricing has stabilized recently in the $150 to $160 per ton range. Assuming stable recycled paper prices, we expect to see improvement in our service revenue growth rates as we work through the year, supported by gains in our International segments and from increases in DMS revenues as we continue to build this business.","Let's take a look at our segment performance on Slide 6. Slide 6 shows key metrics for each of our 3 segments comparing Q1 of this year to Q1 2012. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North America segment while we continue to build our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. For Q1, our North American business segment reported revenues of $542 million, supported by consistent 2% constant dollar storage rental gains. We sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 41%, as savings from our recent sales and account management realignment offset a decrease in gross profits due to lower service revenues.","We're also sustaining capital efficiencies with spending at 4.4% of revenues, excluding real estate.","Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenue, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 10% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Asia Pac.  International adjusted OIBDA margins expanded about 100 basis points.","Benefits from productivity initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio have us on-track towards our goal of about 25% margins in 2013.","Finally, corporate expenses were down compared to prior year levels, reflecting benefits from overhead cost controls and lower stock option expense.","Overall, we continued to drive solid operating performance across our portfolio consistent with our performance.","Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 7. Strong consistent cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. Currently, we're operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.95x at the high end of our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio has increased over the past 2-plus years as planned to support cash shareholder payouts of $1.6 billion and expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT over that period.","As we've stated previously, the cost associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily and modestly push our leverage over the high end of our target range.","We're well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $800 million with $230 million in cash and $612 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our strong cash flow support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. During the first quarter, we paid $52 million in cash dividends and $31 million of REIT costs, including $6 million of REIT-related CapEx.","We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders and we remain well-positioned to fund our business plan.","That concludes our review of the Q1 2013 results. Overall, this was a good quarter in which we continued to drive solid financial performance, supported by storage rental gains and position ourselves to achieve our full year 2013 financial goals.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our 2013 outlook.","Slide 8 summarizes our current 2013 operating outlook. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2013 guidance. Our Q1 performance was as expected and consistent with our full year outlook. We expect to sustain consistent storage rental growth and to see improvement in our service revenue growth rates through the balance of the year.","As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant one-time operating and capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure.","Total operating expense and capital costs are estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million, with the majority of these costs to be incurred in 2013. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline including having our REIT-critical systems operating on a test basis by the third quarter of this year.","For 2013, we expect to incur between $65 million and $95 million of incremental expense, between $30 million and $45 million of CapEx and to pay $105 million to $115 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction of reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36 per share and a use of cash of $185 million to $230 million.","We'll continue to track and report these costs discretely from our underlying operating results. Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the REIT-related items are included in the Appendix.","That concludes our review. In summary, Q1 was a quarter of good financial performance and we're well-positioned to achieve our 2013 financial goals. We continue to execute against our business plans, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. We continue to advance work in connection with the REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders.","Thank you, we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Bill, I'd love to kind of get your thoughts, your first quarter out of the gate, any upside surprises, downside? It's kind of interesting it -- you really get a sense of the durability of the business model within all the additional responsibility in terms of managing through the REIT conversion process. So just any thoughts on that initially would be helpful.","William L. Meaney","Kevin, I think not really any big surprise. We're tracking as planned. I think the only thing that coming is from an outsider coming in, it's always good to see that even though Europe is not doing well from a macroeconomic standpoint -- if you look at the mature markets in Western Europe, is we continued to have solid, physical growth in terms of the -- in terms of storage rental. So we're still tracking quite well even in the mature markets. And then, emerging markets, we're continuing to find more and more upside. So I've been spending quite a bit of my time internationally over the last month or so, and we do have real opportunities there and it's starting to show in our results. So no real surprises, I think we're pretty much within expectations. But it's nice to see that things are tracking ahead.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Great. And then Brian, it looks like we're able to update kind of the REIT-related and other expenditures out through kind of '14 to '16. And I know we can't comment on the PLR, but any sense of what gave us the confidence to do that. Just within the context of the PLR overall would be helpful.","Brian P. McKeon","Well, I think we've said all along that going through this process, we felt we had good arguments on the key issue areas that we need to resolution in the PLR and it's not certain. That's why we need to get feedback from the IRS, but we feel confident in our arguments and made the decision to move forward with the investments, because we need to, given the scope and complexity of our conversion effort to make sure that we're on track for the January 1 conversions. So the estimates that we provided, Kevin, are consistent with what we've highlighted in the past. I think we're just giving you some clarity on how that's playing out in terms of the phasing in 2013. But it's the same range we've been highlighting.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","No, no, no, I know that. I guess, I thought the '14 to '16, that incremental data was new. It looked like the '13 range was consistent, but I hadn't seen the '14 to '16 so I didn't know if that was something that -- just what drove the decision to provide that.","Brian P. McKeon","I think it's consistent with what we've been sharing so...","William L. Meaney","Yes, Kevin. If we had put that out previously and it's really more to do with like the timing of tax payments, primarily that drags it out to '16. There are a couple of conversions that would likely take place past 12\/31\/13 which are also in that column, but we've put that out before.","Brian P. McKeon","It's all consistent with the same plan we've been outlining.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just wanted to get some additional color around your progress in converting your systems to be REIT-compliant by the end of this year and to begin operating as a REIT by the beginning of next year. Could you discuss your progress there? And how you expect the rollout to progress as we move forward?","Brian P. McKeon","Sure, no. We again are targeting to be ready for the election on January 1. And to be positioned to do that, we have to align our legal entities internationally and we have the initial countries that we're converting, which is the U.S. and several other countries and need to have all our information systems aligned so that we can measure performance in qualified REIT subsidiaries, taxable REIT subsidiaries, and ensure that we're complying with the key requirements like the asset test. So we're -- to do that effectively, we're touching a lot of our ERP systems. We have more than one in our company. We've used different versions in International operations. We're in the midst of the heavy lifting of all of that and preparing for kind of a transition over in -- this summer so that we can test this well in advance of the January 1 conversion. And I would say, there's a ton of work going on. We're obviously investing a lot behind that, but everything is on-track, and we feel good about the progress that we're making there.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, as a follow-up question, could you discuss the dynamics in your various International markets as it relates to storage growth? And any opportunities you're seeing in specific countries and strategies you have to increase the performance of some of the markets that you may not be a leader in currently?","William L. Meaney","Well, I think that -- thanks, George. I think, let's kind of divide the International between 2 groups, so the emerging and the mature markets. On the mature side, I think we continue to see some opportunity for tuck-in acquisitions. But even absent of that, we have seen consistently over a number of quarters now is solid -- not just solid revenue growth around storage, but also solid cube growth. So absolutely showing that where people are storing more and more paper and tapes with us during that period. So that's good to see and that's both in countries where we have already established our market-leading position and those of countries where we are not in a market-leading position. And in mature markets, obviously, we have to be more thoughtful in terms of looking at acquisitions that truly complement our current operations and build in terms of our franchise. In the emerging markets, we have, first of all, very strong fundamental underlying growth. But there's also, in a number of countries, we've already established our market-leading position, like Chile, but we're also finding other countries where there's good acquisition opportunities to continue to build on those franchises. And as I say, the underlining franchise themselves are showing very high physical storage growth and revenue growth. In addition, in a number of the emerging markets, specifically around Latin America, we're finding a lot of growth around BPM, or Business Process Management. And that many cases leads us to have even a stickier relationship with a number of our customers. In fact, the number of our customers start with more -- with our work around BPM or managing some of their paper processes and then it leads to storage, rather than the other way around. But as I say, it strengthens our relationship with those customers and we're showing good growth both on the Business Process Management, whilst it has a lower margin, but it has a very high return on invested capital and as I say, and continued strong underlying growth in the physical storage business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to just dig in a little bit on your comments, Bill, on M&A. It sounds like you're looking at a lot of stuff right now. I think previously, we were thinking about the company over kind of like a 10-year period and thinking $100 million a year was kind of the right way to think about what capital allocation to M&A could be. Is that, in the near term, maybe elevated from that level based on what you're seeing out there today?","William L. Meaney","It's hard to comment at this point. We're pretty -- we're very disciplined in terms of our acquisition process. And right now, we're not constrained by capital, but we are seeing more and more opportunities and, as I say, International expansion is an important part of our strategy. We did, as you know, a fairly large acquisition last year in Brazil. We continue to see acquisitions in our pipeline. I think you can expect that we'll continue on that trend. To say what our total appetite is in terms of expenditure around that at this point, it's hard to say, but I wouldn't change our guidance at this stage. But we are aggressively looking at what makes sense from an acquisition standpoint and we will continue to do that. But as I said, it was a very clear view in terms of what our hurdle rates are in terms of return.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And just in terms of managing the balance sheet, maybe Brian on this, you're going to poke a little bit above the targeted level. How comfortable are you about going -- or how high would you go and for how long would you go if the right deal came around above that kind of targeted range?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, that's a good question. I mean, as a company, we've operated above 5x leverage. I'm not saying that that's what we'd be targeting to do. But I mean, I think our business has a lot of capacity to support higher leverage. I think we would look at it in the context of the opportunity. We'd likely perhaps move more towards the 5x range if we needed to temporarily. But I think we'd look at different alternatives and what's the right way to finance the acquisition, too, if we get something more significant. But our longer-term goals are the same. The intent would be to manage our leverage back down towards the 3x to 4x target range. And we feel quite comfortable with the business that we have, that we can both manage the short term and get back to where we're hoping to be over the long term.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And maybe just one more, kind of on this theme. Bill, you kind of talked about you're exploring wholesale data centers on existing land. I think strategically, it makes some sense from a high level, just given your focus on data management and outsourcing key data protection services. But obviously, you're clearly a technically more complex business in terms of what the building actually is and there are specialized developers and owners of that real estate today. As you look at potentially getting into that business, is this something you think you have the skill set in-house? Or is this an area that you think you'd have to kind of bring in a platform to do that?","William L. Meaney","A good question. Well, first of all, I think we start getting into this business because our customers asked us to start providing services. So as you know, we're already providing wholesale data center service to 7 customers in our underground facility as we sit here today. And it's pretty much along the lines that you're saying is that there is an opportunity to continue to both expand that business and then, when we look at what customers want is our underground facility outside Pittsburgh is more of a disaster recovery site and a number of the customers are also asking for wholesale data center services or retail services that service their day-to-day data processing needs. And those need to be closer to their headquarters or their centers of operation. So there's a link between aboveground and underground facilities. That being said, both because the question you asked and do we have the full skill set in-house and because it is a market where there are a number of competitors, is we're doing it in a very thoughtful way in letting our customers lead us into these arrangements rather than spending a lot of capital upfront and building it and see if they come, if you know what I mean. And we are as part of this process adding the right people at the right spots. But this is not large numbers of people, but it's actually hiring the right senior leadership team to support Mark Kidd, who is actually leading that effort for us, to make sure that we have the right critical skill set that can evaluate the opportunity properly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to first ask about the color on the pipeline of new business opportunities, in the commentary that you're optimistic and a lot of it is from new customers of the company. We haven't heard a lot of comments in the past around that pipeline. So can you give a little color on where you're seeing opportunities? And is this an acceleration from what the trend has been in recent years? And just what makes you have that positive commentary?","William L. Meaney","I wouldn't say it's an exploding trend. I think that similar to what we said I think -- I believe we said on the last call this verticalization, I think of it as a way of actually taking out the drill bits and doing the hard mining to get to the next level in the vein of resources. So it's similar along the lines of what we say, we're starting to see some what I call the green shoots in the federal market with our win in the veterans area. And we're seeing some green shoots in the health care area, which is the vertical that we've been operating in the longest, and we're getting into some related areas for our traditional health care clients, which is now almost a 1-for-1 set off on a revenue basis of what we were losing on the service side because the medical records becoming electronic. And yet it's at a -- it had more than a 2x margin because we're replacing that business, the service business, around electronic medical records with more physical storage in areas like pathology, but also in terms of other physical records that is a 1-for-1 almost trade-off in terms of revenue, but at more than 2x the margin. So this is a trend where, as I say, is through the verticalization is mining deeper either in our current client relationships or clients that are in that sector but have traditionally not outsourced or completely outsourced their storage business.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just following up on that, can you give an example or 2 of how the offerings have changed in health care? Are you doing things different or is it really understanding the pain points for the customer and how to adopt the current offerings to help them relieve their issues?","William L. Meaney","It's a little bit of both. So I mean, one area and a new area which we've started in just the recent months is in the whole pathology area, which was an area that, oddly enough, we were in way back when through an acquisition we did in Boston, our first acquisition in Boston, but it's now a business that we're coming back into. As well, it has a number of areas where they weren't as sensitive to the documentation that they were keeping, either from a compliance standpoint or a space standpoint. So it's more areas where there was less sensitivity in terms of space and or compliance requirements and they now need to have those documents stored in a secure way. And the other side, as I say, is areas like pathology, which people now are realizing that those types of samples need to be stored in a proper way.","Brian P. McKeon","Gary, I'd also highlight that I think the dedicated sales focus in the health care vertical, we had other product offerings. We do DMS-type work, we have our product offering around digital records center for medical imaging. And being in the flow of all the change that's going on in the health care space has enabled our organization to identify opportunities, to do things like grow storage. So I think that part of the concept around the verticalization strategy is having more -- having sales and account management resources that have more specific industry insight. And by being involved with the changes that our customers are going through, we're better able to identify opportunities to do business with them. And that's certainly been the case in health care.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that make sense. And then, just one last one which is, just what gives you confidence -- in the commentary I heard, a comment I heard a couple of times that you think the service declines will ease as we move through the year. Is it really just a comps issue or is there anything else going on?","William L. Meaney","It's a comp issue in that we knew we were up against, particularly in International, some shredding account losses and we had a DMS account that we're working through. And so we know we'll be up against more favorable compares. But also that we're targeting improved growth in areas like DMS as we work through the year and that will help as well. We just really wanted to highlight that this isn't a change in trend. This is a kind of a consistent underlying trend on activity-based volume. We do have some tougher comps and we expect those numbers to improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","Unknown Analyst","For Scott. Can you take us a little deeper on the drivers of International margins in the quarter, and if you see any particular dynamic that might enable you to exceed your long-term target there?","William L. Meaney","The key drivers there, we were having good underlying storage growth. In the International business, we had a 12% constant dollar, 5% internal, solid growth across the business. And I think that is a good -- helps everything. It's a high-margin business and helps us to build scales across our business. And we continued to see the flow-through benefits of the improvement plan in Western Europe. If you recall the portfolio review and the productivity improvement plan that we implemented, those benefits to continue to just flow through. We're comfortable that we're on track towards the goal that we outlined in the 2-year plan of the 25% margin growth. This achievement, this year, not signaling any upside to that. And we've indicated over time, we think there is room for additional margin improvement in International but want to temper our expectations there where we think future gains will be more moderate, and that we're really focused on maximizing the value opportunity there. But -- so no change in the expectations, but we feel good about the progress that we're making.","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, and just one thing to add to that, Scott, is remember -- and again, I think we mentioned this last time, you have to look at our International business, because of the growth potential there, as a portfolio. So as countries, for instance, if we take again Chile, which has amongst the highest margins of our operations worldwide, mature or emerging markets, is because if we've got our market-leading position there, there will be other places where we continue to build a market-leading position so it would generally drift those margins up. But we are adding in new areas where we have real opportunity. So it's a portfolio approach of adding less mature opportunities into a group of countries that may be getting more mature. So net-net, you have to -- it's not clear that it would even be the right strategy to say that our average margin would go up internationally because that would signal that we're not finding new markets to actually go into and eventually build a market-leading position. So you have to look at it as a portfolio approach in International. The key in International is to make sure that when we're doing acquisitions, we have a clear discipline in terms of our return on invested capital and return on equity. And we have a clear strategic vision of how that country or that investment will eventually build into a market-leading position.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Shui of Stifel.","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You guys had mentioned that the improvement in North American margins are partially due to the realignment of the sales force for the health care vertical. Can you give us a sense of how much North American margins can potentially improve as you guys realign the sales force verticals beyond health care?","William L. Meaney","We had a little trouble hearing you. But -- the end of the question you're saying how much more could North American margins increase?","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, once you realign the sales force beyond health care.","Brian P. McKeon","The sales force realignment that was done last year wasn't just related to health care, it was a broader realignment. And we've been consistently signaling, don't expect margin improvement in North America. I think we've got a very high margin business operation. We're trying to sustain that and be balanced about an appropriate level of investment to ensure we have a healthy and sustained annuity over time. So those efficiencies enabled us to sustain good returns and that's what you should expect for this year.","William L. Meaney","And just to emphasize Brian's comment, the verticalization is about maintaining our consistent storage revenue growth in North America. It's not about margin expansion. There was a one-time benefit of that in terms of the realignment to the sales force that allowed us to be more efficient. But the verticalization is really about to be able to maintain our consistent revenue growth performance around storage in North America.","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And to change direction, given where paper prices are now at a relatively depressed level compared to last year, have you guys seen any improvement to the pricing environment for Shredding?","Brian P. McKeon","Paper prices have been in a relatively consistent range, $150 to $160 a ton, for several months now. So I think that stability, it's a bit below the longer-term averages, which would be in the $200 a ton range. And I think the Shredding business, we feel good about progress there. But I wouldn't signal that there's any meaningful change in kind of pricing dynamics. It's been a relatively stable environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you go back to internal revenue change in core service, the minus 7 is kind of a larger number relative to last couple of years. Do you feel like the things that have affected the first quarter will meaningfully get better through the year? Or do you feel like this will be a year of larger declines in core service than we've experienced in the past?","Brian P. McKeon","Andrew, we were trending minus 3 to minus 4 internal growth Q3, Q4. If you look back to Q1 of last year, we had growth in core service. So this isn't a fundamental change. I mean, I think we're seeing very consistent kind of pressures on the mature market activity-based services and we would expect to move back towards more kind of the range that we were in the last couple of quarters and with opportunity to improve on that because we have goals that we have in terms of driving project-based revenue and building aspects of our business. So I think it's -- we're trying to signal don't take Q1 and trend that out in terms of a growth rate that's more reflecting lapping and some specific things. But I think the trends that we saw later last year are probably more indicative of where we'll be heading in the next couple of quarters.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful, Brian, and one more question on the same subject. You also cited declines in destruction as part of that dynamic in core service. And whenever I hear declines in destruction, I often think that, that should help the storage revenues. Is that dynamic happening or is this a different type of destruction?","Brian P. McKeon","Well, we did see, in terms of the destruction and termination fees, it's not a huge driver of the number in North America, but it was lower in Q1, down double digits. Some of that's timing, so I don't want to indicate like a fundamental change there. But you're right, that is a relatively positive dynamic. I think it's reflective of a lot of the work that we've been doing over the last couple of years on customer retention, customer excellence and the benefits of that. So yes, it should be something that helps us over time. Some of -- to be fair, I mean, some of this is just timing and when things happen. But I think that is a theme that hopefully you are hearing here that we feel quite good about the storage dynamic. I think it's consistent, it's healthy. We're expanding our footprint globally and as that, our International business continues to grow, it has very healthy underlying growth rates. We're feeling good about that as a longer-term trend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Follow up. In thinking about all the investment you're doing in terms of preparing for the REIT, is that fully captured in the one-time cost and charges that you've been giving us that number for the REIT? Or are there some costs through SG&A and cost of sales that might fall off next year as you get through the process? And if so, how significant are those costs?","Brian P. McKeon","It won't fall off, Gary. It will go the other way candidly in the sense that we've been highlighting all along that as our anticipation, as we come through the conversion process, there's a whole bunch of one-time costs. We will have a level of incremental ongoing costs in we've -- our estimate, I believe, has been $10 million to $15 million. If you think about it, we're going to need additional tax resources, some additional financial resources, legal resources to just manage the incremental compliance requirements, things of that nature. We do anticipate that over time, we should get efficiencies as well out of this effort and that we're standardizing a lot of our systems and our approaches. I think that's going to take a little time to flow through because our focus really here is to make sure we're getting to the goal line on the right -- as quickly as we can and to make sure we don't miss that. But I wouldn't expect or I don't want to signal that we're going to see like a drop off in underlying costs. We really tried to be clear about segregating these costs and they're separate from our ongoing operational costs.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","William L. Meaney","Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we're off to a good start in 2013. Our durable growth in storage rental continues, we have attractive opportunities to sustain that growth through acquisitions and further expansion into emerging markets, as well as investment in our adjacent businesses -- opportunities. We are on track to deliver against our financial goals. We're making good progress on preparations for our planned conversion to a REIT and we have an attractive storage rental business with durable, high-quality net operating income that aligns well with REITs.","As we continue to execute against our plan, we will be focused on prudent capital allocation, maximizing total returns and delivering sustainable value to our shareholders.","Thank you for joining us this morning.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would like to now turn the call over to you host Ms. Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Andrea, and welcome everyone to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. We also have Stuart Brown our incoming CFO with us on the call today.","After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. And as we've done in the past several quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations\/Financial Information.","Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's supplemental, the earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently-filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a very good start after our May 2 closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter one. Synergies from Recall are coming in faster than anticipated in 2016, and based on all this, we reconfirmed the full-year guidance we gave back in April.","We're also pleased to welcome Stuart Brown as our new CFO. Stuart officially joined us last week, and I know he is looking forward to getting more engaged in the business and meeting with our investors and analysts.","Stuart has a unique blend of both global operating company and REIT experience, and I know he will be a great fit with our executive team. And whilst we are sad that Rod will be leaving us, he will be around for a few months yet to ensure a smooth transition to Stuart.","Turning now to our progress on Recall's benefits and integration. First, just to summarize, overall the acquisition makes us the only global platform in our industry as we continue to expand our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing cyber security threats and seek to turn information into business value.","As we've noted in the past, this transaction has three core benefits. First, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets. Second, it strengthens our ability to reach mid-market businesses where Recall was very present and Iron Mountain was significantly underrepresented in this very large and high-margin segment.","And third, the level of synergy enables significant growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution. This rapid and large expansion of cash flow allows us to simultaneously invest in new product and innovation for the benefit of our customers, significantly grow our dividend, while simultaneously de-levering and markedly bringing down our payout ratio.","Finally, this acquisition further supports the trust our customers have in Iron Mountain to serve both their current and future needs. Trust in Iron Mountain to protect what matters most, trust that Iron Mountain will be available to continue to support them in 50-years' time, and trust in Iron Mountain to continue to use its scale for innovation and to provide expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of their overall storage and information assets.","In the customer interactions we have had since closing the acquisition, their commentary has been very positive as they can see how we both have the intention and the resources to be even more innovative.","An example of our product innovation was reported in a recent Bloomberg profile, highlighting the work we are doing on behalf of MTV as they celebrate their 35th anniversary.","On a more operational note, I'm pleased with the team's work to welcome new customers and begin integrating operations. During the second quarter, we accomplished a number of critical integration-related initiatives, whilst continuing to pursue our transformation agenda.","And we delivered internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in the base Iron Mountain business, consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. In short, we kept our eye on the ball despite all the activities surrounding the Recall close.","More specifically, since the closing on May 2, our integration progress includes several key initiatives. We completed our review of Recall's leadership and immediately brought the management teams together, enhancing our organization through the retention of key former executives to lead areas such as customer experience, mid-market and SMB sales, as well as key finance roles in a number of country and territory management positions.","We converted Recall's operations in four countries into our REIT structure. We completed the disposition of Recall's business in 23 U.S. markets as required by the United States Department of Justice. We received final clearance from the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority.","We solicited and are currently evaluating bids on required dispositions in additional jurisdictions. We began a portfolio review of both companies' service offerings to determine optimal platforms for ensuring continued superior customer service. And we undertook real estate reviews in select markets and identified initial consolidation opportunities in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as in the United States.","As a result of these and other quick actions and outstanding facilitation from the transitioning Recall teams, we're getting the synergies faster than expected. This means more impact this year. In fact, we will exit 2016 having achieved more than 80% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017.","We appreciate that given the closing of Recall a month into the quarter, our second-quarter results don't fully reflect Recall's contribution. And as we noted on last quarter's call, Q2 margins would reflect that Recall's core EBITDAR margins are lower than ours. In fact, Recall's EBITDAR margins have consistently been more than 700 basis points lower than ours. But we saw a bit more impact from that initially given that the assets to be divested and those already sold are among the higher-margin markets in their portfolio.","You will recall the execution of our integration program increases the Recall base margin business by pulling two levers. First, in the near-term, we're achieving synergies in SG&A and labor costs. And second, in the medium-term, we'll improve our operating leverage as we consolidate facilities.","Rod will have more detail shortly and walk you through the build-up to our full-year expectations. In brief, when we prorate year-to-date results, add in accelerated synergies, second half transformation benefit and typical ramp we see in the business throughout the year, we are comfortable slightly raising the bottom end of our guidance range relative to what we provided back in April.","Now turning to some of the quarter's results at a high level before Rod walks you through the ins and outs that can also be found in the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was 19%, with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. On an internal basis, storage growth was 2.1% and in line with levels achieved in Q4 and Q1. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year.","Internal volume or prior to acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarters' performance at 1.7% worldwide growth. Service revenue was flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of projects. However, based on our service project pipeline, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue, as well as service gross profit growth for the full year.","As mentioned previously, given our expected service mix, we will maintain our focus on increasing service gross profit rather than purely gross margins. Our new service offerings are sometimes lower margin, but generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Consistent with this focus, you will note service gross profit was up more than 18% in the second quarter, exceeding the growth in constant dollar service revenue.","Turning to progress on our strategic plan: during the quarter, we continued to advance each of the three pillars of the plan, as well as the foundational elements that support it. I will quickly highlight progress in each of the three pillars, namely, getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expansion in faster-growing adjacent businesses.","In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we had 3 million cubic feet of internal volume growth during the quarter. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in emerging markets supports that objective and has helped drive our emerging market business to 16.4% of total revenue on a constant-dollar basis as of the end of Q2.","Additionally, as our visibility on closing of Recall transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity and moved into new emerging markets during the year. Earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire the Information Management operations of Santa Fe Group in 10 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia for approximately \u20ac27 million. The deal also marks our entry into four new emerging markets, Macau, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea, as well as further bolstering our already strong positions in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, providing a great foundation for further expansion in this dynamic and higher-growth region.","We continue to nurture a deep, diverse pipeline of accretive M&A opportunities in emerging markets where we can leverage our global footprint and deep customer relationships to capture the initial wave of records management outsourcing that is in the early days within these faster-growing markets.","Before turning away from our international operations, I should comment on Brexit. Importantly, we don't expect to see a significant impact. We have built scenarios related to the potential implications of the decision with particular focus on our customers, our supply base, our staff and the regulatory and fiscal frameworks in which we operate.","We will continue to monitor developments closely and watch for any shifting legal obligations governing the management of information, but as other multinationals have acknowledged, it will be some time before any meaningful movement toward an exit from the EU gets underway. In terms of our core business, it is unlikely to have much impact from a constant-currency perspective, we're generally naturally hedged.","As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020 up from just 2% at the end of 2015.","In our data center business, we had several recent big wins, bringing us to 80% committed in our first phase building in our aboveground facility in Boston. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, Missouri, our data center space is greater than 90% committed and we are on track to achieve internal growth approaching 20% in this business area.","In our Art Storage business, we are making good progress and acquired another small business, a good example of what we believe will be a long-term consolidation play. Overall, between the progress we're making in emerging markets, as well as adjacent businesses, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, which is up from about 17.5% of our total business mix today.","In terms of supporting foundations for the plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. Also as previously disclosed, the remaining $25 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA.","Given the timing of Recall synergies, our transformation program and expected ramp in the business, we remain confident that cash flow will be in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day, and again on our April 1 call, which provides the foundation for our expected dividend growth.","As a reminder, we expect to grow dividend per share by about 13% in 2017, as the synergies and transformation benefits flow through our results, and by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments in support of our previously-presented 2020 plan.","As we progress this plan, we'll have more cash available to support discretionary investment, which means we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to de-lever. And at the same time, we'll reduce our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles.","In addition, we're extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead.","Our durable storage business generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in both good and bad times.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.","Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with a high-level overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which included a two-month benefit from the Recall acquisition compared to the prior year. In addition, I will review our results by segment, provide an update on our transformation initiative and summarize our successful bridge loan refinancing.","Lastly, I will touch on the strong progress we're making integrating Recall into our business, as well as our outlook for 2016, which remains essentially unchanged since April. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Consistent with prior quarters, we've provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings-per-share, and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on pages 21 through 24 of the supplemental.","Let me briefly walk you through the highlights. For the second quarter, total reported revenues were $884 million compared with $760 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year negative FX impact of approximately 2% or roughly $17 million, on a constant-dollar basis, revenues grew by 18.6%. For the first half of the year, reported revenues were $1.63 billion compared with $1.51 billion in 2015.","Excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal storage rental revenue was up 2.1% for Q2, consistent with the growth we saw in Q1. In contrast, internal service revenue was down 2.1% compared with growth of 1.6% we saw in Q1.","As we noted on our last call, service revenues are more project-based, which have more volatile growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Based on a review of our service deal pipeline, we continue to expect internal service revenue growth to be positive for the full year.","Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $261 million compared with $223 million in 2015. We grew adjusted OIBDA by 17.1% on a reported-dollar basis and by 18.8% on a constant-dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 9.3% reported dollar, and by 11.6% on a constant-dollar basis.","As we noted on our Q1 call, Recall is a lower-margin business than Iron Mountain, therefore, as expected, our adjusted OIBDA margins were lower relative to the first quarter of the year. This impact flows through to our adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO results. As synergies build in future quarters, this picture will be reversed.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 compared with $0.28 in 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.60 in 2015. In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the increased depreciation expense of Recall's legacy racking structures.","The amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to FFO per share; however, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO per share. FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter compared with $0.49 in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, FFO per share was $0.98 compared with $0.99 in the year-ago period. AFFO was $159 million compared with $131 million in the year-ago period.","Importantly, AFFO was not impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter, as these are non-cash items and do not impact our AFFO or cash available for distribution.","Year-to-date, AFFO was $301 million compared with $259 million in 2015. AFFO for the year-to-date is at the high end of our expectations. However, we expect to remain within our ranges for the full year.","Similar to prior quarters, on page 20 of the supplemental, we are providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement. So you can more readily see the cash items that are not typically of a recurring nature.","Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 17.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Expected year-over-year increase in our structural tax rates was mostly driven by the legacy Recall business, which has higher exposure to international markets with their respective foreign tax rates, and which do not have the same tax efficiency as we do in the U.S. with the REIT structure.","Also, the tax rate this quarter is below the previously-communicated run rate expectation of 20%, as our pre-tax income was impacted by Recall integration and deal costs. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18%, as a result of these Recall costs. However, beyond 2016, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 19% to 20%.","Let's turn to our financial performance by segments, in North American Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.7% for the second quarter.","North American RIM internal service revenue declined by 1.2%. Growth in shredding and scanning was offset by declines in core transportation.","North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.3% for the second quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity, partially offset by strong growth in new Data Management offerings. In addition, we had a large project which benefited the prior-year period. After normalizing for this, DM service revenues performed in line with prior quarters. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to a decrease in overhead costs as we continue to realize transformation benefits.","The Western Europe segment generated 0.1% internal storage rental growth and internal service revenue declined by 4.6%, primarily as a result of lower activity in transportation-related revenue and lower project revenue. The low internal storage growth in Western Europe was due to a large customer win in the year-ago period and certain contract renegotiations that occurred this quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year in Western Europe due to lower G&A expenses.","The Other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Internal storage rental growth was 8.6% and internal service growth was 5.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 25% for the quarter, in line with our expectations.","We're pleased with the progress we've made with our transformation initiative. During the second quarter, we did not incur significant costs related to transformation, as the focus was not head count related; rather it was on streamlining business processes. Year-to-date, we've actioned $28 million of the $50 million exit rate savings and have line-of-sight on incremental $22 million to be implemented by the end of this year. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018.","Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and provide details on the costs we've incurred so far in 2016 to achieve synergies and integrate Recall within our business. As Bill explained, the synergy program is ahead of schedule. As you can see on the supplemental on page 25, we expect to exit this year having already achieved more than 80% of the total synergies originally anticipated for 2017.","Our expectations of total cost to achieve the target synergies are still consistent with prior projections. Because we're accelerating synergies to set us up for a strong run rate for 2017, we expect to incur roughly $10 million more in costs in 2016 than originally contemplated. Year-to-date, we've incurred $37 million of integration costs, $32 million of deal close costs.","Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Please note, these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are one time in nature. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent, given the durability of our business. We remain on track to achieve our short and long-term financial objectives.","Please note that although our guidance assumes divestitures would occur on day one, the benefit from businesses yet to be divested that are running through our operating results is not significant. Some legacy Recall assets were sold to Access nearly at the same time as the close, so they are not reflected in our results.","The remaining legacy Recall assets to be sold are included in discontinued operations, therefore not flowing through our operating income. Lastly, the remaining Iron Mountain assets to be disposed of are flowing through our financials; however, with an immaterial benefit for the quarter and full year.","Overall, our core Iron Mountain business is performing to plan. Recall contribution is tracking in line with our previous expectations, and we have accelerated the realization of net synergies for the year, which is why we brought up the lower end of our adjusted OIBDA guidance by $5 million.","Let me now refer you to the table at the bottom of our guidance page, on page 12 of the supplemental, to follow our expectations for full-year adjusted OIBDA. We thought it'd be helpful to cover how results track against our original expectations. But please note, we will be not reporting actual results separately, given our financial statements are now fully integrated.","Our standalone expectation for Iron Mountain's core business remains $950 million to $970 million, consistent with what we previously communicated. And our performance in the first half of year is tracking right in line with our expectation. For the second quarter, excluding Recall's base and synergies less divestitures, Iron Mountain's standalone adjusted OIBDA was in line with Q1 results at $235 million. So year-to-date, Iron Mountain standalone adjusted OIBDA was roughly $470 million.","In the second half of the year, we expect to realize $7 million to $10 million of transformation benefits to offset costs associated with that program in the first half. We also expect a ramp in the business as our storage base continues to expand. This ramp is consistent with 2015, during which second half-year results were $10 million higher than the first half on a reported-dollar basis. If you annualize the first half actual run rate, our transformation benefits and a similar ramp to last year, standalone expectations are in line.","Now let me address the second line related to Recall's contribution for the year. Prior to divestitures, we expect the Recall business to contribute $115 million of adjusted OIBDA at the midpoint. This reflects eight months of Recall contribution, and our range implies $13 million to $15 million per month of contribution prior to synergies and divestitures.","Lastly, we are expecting $18 million of adjusted OIBDA synergies, net of the impact of the divestitures for the year. As Bill noted, this is up from our initial expectation of $15 million.","As a result, our adjusted OIBDA guidance range for 2016 is now $1.075 billion to $1.110 billion. For adjusted EPS, our guidance remains unchanged, although our expectations for the structural tax rate are lower than previously anticipated. This benefit will likely be offset by the accelerated depreciation of Recall racking structures.","Although our total normalized dollar AFFO guidance remains the same, we changed our FFO per share guidance to reflect where we expect the final weighted average share count will settle for the year. We did not update adjusted EPS for this impact because the benefit is offset by the incremental real estate depreciation expense mentioned earlier. Please also note that on a constant dollar, guidance remains close to reported dollars. Assuming current rates hold, we do not see a downside from FX in our guidance.","Moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investment for 2016, we continue to estimate that it'll be roughly $600 million. This provides ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments.","Our capital deployment plans for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on our last earnings call, and to total $170 million for the year.","Our expectation for total real estate investment spend remains $320 million. This includes $70 million in core growth racking investment and the remainder of our real estate spend is expected to be in real estate consolidation, development, data center and some lease conversions.","As we've said in the past, we are focused on consolidating facilities, particularly given the Recall transaction. We expect real estate consolidation will provide upsides to synergies in the long-term, but it's too early for us to quantify the exact benefit at this time.","For M&A, we continue to expect to spend roughly $150 million, with approximately $100 in emerging markets, $50 million in developed markets.","Dividend expectations remain consistent with our previous guidance for 2016. Our dividend per share is expected to grow from $1.94 this year to a minimum of $2.20 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2018, as we realize the majority of benefits, transformation savings and Recall synergies.","Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share at roughly 4% per year. Importantly, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is in line with prior expectations and should reduce to 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. In addition, we're targeting a leverage ratio of 5.0 times by 2020.","Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $580 million and our lease-adjusted debt ratio was slightly up at 5.8 times as expected. Our leverage ratio increased primarily as a result of the timing of Recall integration and deal costs discussed earlier.","We expect to end the year at a leverage ratio at 5.7 times as we start realizing synergies and transformation savings. As many of you may already know, we refinanced the $850 million bridge facility associated with Recall transaction, primarily with long term debt.","We raised $750 million in aggregate principal amount and senior unsecured notes, which included $500 million at 4-3\/8% due in 2021 and $250 million at 5-3\/8% due in 2026. Our unsecured debt was prices at spreads similar to business services issues rated two notches higher than Iron Mountain, and at the top of the spread range for our investment grade issuers, which reflect debt investors' favorable view of our predictable cash flow.","In addition, we also amended our credit agreement and extended its maturity to 2019. So overall, we are pleased with the performance we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our long-term plan. We're excited with the progress we've made so far in integrating Recall, and pleased that we will be realizing synergies earlier-than-expected.","Looking ahead, we're confident that we're well-positioned to deliver on our long-term goals. We remain highly focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth in cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments.","I'll now hand the call back to Bill.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Rod. To wrap up before going to Q&A, just to summarize, we're off to a very successful start after closing Recall and having accomplished what we set out to do in the first three months since closing. We made great progress on integrating Recall's people, platform and portfolio. We're on track with our financial expectations for the year, and in fact, slightly raised the lower end of our range for the full-year guidance. And additionally, we like what we see as we look at our exit rate from 2016 and our entry into 2017. Overall, we are excited about the potential we see to realize the benefits of combined scale with Recall and look forward to updating you on continued progress next quarter.","Before I turn it over to questions, I should say that I think our transformation program probably has reduced the caffeine in my coffee in the morning. So I did, I think, misstate that Access \u2013 we sold 23 U.S. markets to Access, I meant to say 13. So, 13 is much better than 23 and I will talk to the transformation folks to kind of put the caffeine back in my coffee. But any way, with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over to Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, It's Shlomo Rosenbaum over here prior to the name change I guess.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Shlomo, I was wondering who is at Stifel's these days.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","A couple things I want to ask. One of them is around the \u2013 what looks like the destructions and the out-perms. If you look particularly at the out-perms in Western Europe International, it looks like in the last couple of quarters you are seeing some acceleration over there in terms of volumes. Can you give us some color on what exactly is going on there?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, sure. Sure, Shlomo. So first of all, let's look at the absolute net volume, right? So if you look at Q2 2016 this quarter, you'll see that out-perms and destructions, if you subtract that from new sales and organic growth, you have a net before acquisitions of 3.8% (sic) [3.7%] growth versus a Q1 of 3% growth, so the net growth has actually increased.","But coming to specifically your question about what's going on with out-perms is, the 2.3% in Q1 of 2016 is not out of norm. So if you kind of go back and you look at the supplemental on page 11, you'll see that over the last 12 month \u2013 or less, say, even more than 1.5 years or so, you'll see going back into Q3 of 2014, it goes somewhere between 2.1% and 2.3%. Where you really see the spike is in the Q2 2016 number, where you see that go up to 2.6%, so it's really a Q2 issue. But as I say, the net volume is positive.","And for those that followed Recall, there was a program that Doug would euphemistically call Close the Gap. And the two things he referred to was the 700-or-so basis points lower gross margin that their business yielded in terms of their overall business. And the other thing is, he highlighted that the level of out-perms that they had relative to ours. So, where we see the roughly the 30 bp increase in out-perms from Q1 to Q2, that's driven by Recall's \u2013 emerging Recall's business into ours, which we knew was a \u2013 had a less \u2013 had a higher volatility or a higher turn in that. But you'll see that come down over time because obviously, we're wrapping the same customer loyalty program, which I think we've spoken on previous calls where we have \u2013 we built a \u2013 with outside help, we built an algorithm that helps predict 6 months to 12 months ahead of time certain customer issues that prevent the out-perms.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, they had a higher out-perm. Was it the nature of their business? Or based on what you are describing, it sounds like they didn't have as effective a customer outreach as what Iron Mountain core had. Is that the way to think about it?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's the latter. So and Doug used to comment on his calls, I guess, they only did half year results. But it's exactly that they didn't have the same tools. And in fact, three years ago, we basically introduced the tools \u2013 I can't take credit for it, they started the work before I came in, but we started ramping up just as I came in. And you would've seen the same decrease in Iron Mountain's business.","And one of the things that Recall had is, they couldn't afford to take the investment that we did. I mean, we brought in some outside help and advisers that know how to build these tools, and it looks at a number of different things. It looks at volume through the call center. It looks at number of boxes coming in. It looks at the types of complaints that we're getting from a customer, and there's a number of different things that you pick up. The last time we gave them a price increase. And you look at those different pieces of data, and it's pretty accurate in terms of predicting when you're heading for a crisis with that customer and then you can intervene. And I forget exactly what their number was, but it was significantly \u2013 it was at least a full point higher than ours in terms of the out-perms. And you're seeing that averaging in when we go from the 2.3% to 2.6%. So it is something \u2013 it isn't structural in the Recall business. It was much more they just didn't have the same tools and sophistication that we introduced, say, three years ago.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Bill, did you have a chance to go back, now that you own the company, and a look at how many of the out-perms that they were experiencing actually were incoming to you guys and kind of do an analysis on that?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","A great question and I wish I could've gotten the DOJ \u2013 the DOJ asked the same question. I wish I could have gotten them to be data-driven. Actually, the loss ratio between \u2013 the win and loss ratio between us and them was actually much smaller than you would think, right? I mean, we'd like to say we competed against each other and we did. But actually, generally, they lost to somebody else, and we lost to somebody else.","And that \u2013 I think we've talked about it previously where they have \u2013 they did \u2013 they have taken business from us. There was no question about that. But where they were much more present was in that middle market and SMB space, so they were winning and losing against much more the smaller players. And we're actually quite excited about it, to be honest with you.","So their head of sales for North America now runs our whole mid-market SMB segment. And that business is, I think, approaching almost $800 million. I think $750 million of sales, if we combine the two companies. So, it's of the same size of what Recall was globally just in North America, and we think we can to a better job. So, they were losing typically to other people, and we were losing to other people for the most part.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi, thanks, good morning. You're substantially pulling forward Recall synergies, about 80% of total synergies previously expected by the end of 2017. That said, OIBDA guidance for the full year is not meaningfully increasing. Can you discuss what incremental headwinds you expect in the back half that are reflected in guidance?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a good question, George, but it's more the math. So the part \u2013 it's not as big a delta as you think because you have to look at what the translation of the $15 million, because of the way the synergies flow in during the course of the year, what we get for impact in 2016 leads you to a very high \u2013 which is small, leads you to a very high exit. So, I'm trying to remember the number, but I'll ask Rod to comment. I think we were before the $15 million translated into around $60 million, $65 million. And the $18.5 million translates into around $80 million. But it's not a \u2013 it's 80% \u2013 we were always going to achieve a very high percentage; just we weren't going to achieve 80% before in terms of going into 2017.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes, George, our exit rate is 80% of next year as opposed to the in-year being 80% of 2017. So in-year, we're sort of net $3 million higher, but actually that translates into quite a significant improvement in the exit rate that we have for next year and sets us up really nicely for 2017. So it's not that the number's gone up and we're using that to cover for other things. That's not the case at all.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's just we're getting it faster. It's just \u2013 it is a speed, but it gives you an idea that when we get into 2017, we're cracking the back of it. We're always going to crack the back of it in 2016. We are even cracking a bigger part of it in 2016 than we originally thought.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Can you remind us what the 80% previously was in terms of exit rate?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, it was around 70%, right? I think, it was about 70% \u2013 we'll give you the exact number. I think it was about 70% because it was 60% on 90%, right? So I think it was about 70%.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was of that order, George, 65% to 70%.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Can you provide some additional details around how records management volumes performed in Recall's business compared to recent historical trends and expectations?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Say it one more time.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Basically, how Recall's volumes performed relative to your expectations and relative to their...","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, all right. Yes. Okay, so in terms of their historical trend, so pretty much as we expected, other than \u2013 we expected, as I answered to Shlomo, we expected that the out-perms would be higher and that pretty much translated straight across because we could see that in the results. The growth and opportunity we see in the middle market is pretty much what we expected. I think that the \u2013 so the trends of merging their business into ours, we're pretty much on track. The margin that both I commented on and Rod commented on, we commented on last quarter before we closed. We knew that, that was the case.","I think the one thing that has been the \u2013 so it's been more of an upside, and I think the upside has been more around the people. Not that we expected to get bad people. But I think when you buy a competitor, you always kind of think that they're different than you, and when you're talking to customers, you typically demonize the competitor. And guess what? They have blood flowing through their veins just like us, and we've gotten some really good people as a result of it. And they had almost identical values and code of conduct as we had. In fact, you lay the two slides up next to each other, we did it at a town hall, and they're virtually almost the same.","So I don't know who copied from who? So we've actually, probably, if anything, have integrated the people much quicker. And when I say integrated, not just get them into slots, but people feel like they've been around a lot longer than they have, if you know what I mean. In other words, they didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out or adapt to a new culture. So that part has been better than we thought. But in terms of the way the numbers have flowed in, we haven't found any surprises.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Got it, helpful. And then, lastly, could you provide an update on services trends, if you're seeing continued signs of stability or any potential risks to growth ahead?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, it's a good question. So I think we also pretty \u2013 kind of foreshadowed at the last quarter that we thought we would see a drop in service revenue, that the next \u2013 Q2 wouldn't be as strong as Q1. And so obviously, we could see the pipeline, and we knew how that worked.","The one thing that I think again we commented last time is that as we shift more to project-based rather than transportation-based service revenue, we do expect it to be pipeline-dependent and, therefore, more project-dependent and, therefore, more lumpy. So it's much easier to predict that if you look over a 12-month period than if you look at it on a 1-month or even a 3-month period.","So if we \u2013 as that as a backdrop, if we look forward to the rest of the year, we like the pipeline, the booking pipeline \u2013 the bookings and the pipeline that we see for the rest of the year. So we're very confident that for the total year, we will see positive service revenue growth, which obviously means that the new services are offsetting the declines that we talked about in the transportation, which has driven to the structural shift in the way that the information is being used. So we feel very good that for the full year, you'll see a trend that's consistent with Q1 as the pipeline turns into bookings and turns into projects that we see in front of us.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. If it's okay I'm going to dive back into tapes \u2013 North American tapes decline. I just don't quite get how the minus 13.5% organic services decline in North American tapes has to do with a large project from a year ago. The decline in that business is 7 points worse than the first quarter decline, but the comp year-over-year is only 4 points, let's call it, less easy. And so, when I kind of see this 13.5% decline versus a year ago, minus 1.7%, it just doesn't seem like the year-over-year comparison explains it all.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's a good question, Andrew. So first of all, our \u2013 so that business also includes film and sound, right, which is very project-dependent. So a year ago, we had a very large project with one of our film and sound customers, and that project fell off. So if you normalize for that, what you see is roughly the 9% to 10% reduction in transportation that we've been calling out quarter-by-quarter. And the new services have been offsetting that between 40% and 50% of that decline. So the net decline and you'll see that going forward as well is that the net decline as the new services replace some of the transportation as the tapes are becoming more for disaster recovery rather than for rotation, then you'll see that the typical 9% to 10% decline in transportation and being offset by 40% or 50% by the growth in new products. But specifically, our Data Management business includes both the data protection and the tape business, as well as our film and sound business, which we had a very large project for a studio.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I got it. I think what you just said was the transportation business was down about the same as first quarter, we had some more new services in the first quarter, expect more of it for the rest of the year, but not as much in the second quarter, with a large project a year ago?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no, the only thing \u2013 the first part was right, but we had the same amount of growth in the new service products in Q2 as we did in Q1. So roughly, what I'm saying is that what you can expect is that, the underlying business in Q2 was like Q1 if you took out the large project. So you had transportation going down to 9% to 10%, and then you had new services offsetting about 40% to 50% of that decline. So in other words, you end up net in the mid-single-digit decline in terms of the service revenue of that business. And we expect that trend to be similar in Q3 and Q4.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yeah, it was at this time in Q2 last year, this film and sound project, so it screws up the comparisons, but Q3 should be about normal.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And that was just one quarter, right? We don't have any tough comps on the film project going into the second half, right?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.","No, it was a Q2 issue.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the time.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was a nice issue to have last year, I should say. I'm not saying that having large project is an issue. It's just explaining it a year later how they roll in and roll out?","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. No, I'm sure it was a fun project. I appreciate it, thank you.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Andrew.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good morning guys. So I wanted to ask a little bit just for an update on pricing trends, particularly in Europe, given that the organic volume gains were up pretty nicely, but total organic was flattish. I think you mentioned some contract renegotiations. So, maybe just an update on what's going on in the pricing environment would be helpful?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.","Yes. In Western Europe, we had a couple of things, one affected last year, and then also impacting this year. So in Q2 of last year, we actually had a gain as a result of some renegotiations that went on at that point to do with a specific project and specific customer.","This year, we had a couple of customers that went the other way in terms of the renegotiations that we had, which obviously, you have a sort of strong quarter last year and a relatively weak quarter this year. So you got a double impact in terms of the growth rate.","I think in terms of overall, if you strip that out and then talk about overall pricing, in Western Europe, we do see a modest price erosion over time because we have quite high price legacy base. So that's a phenomenon you'll see if you look in some of our historic numbers, that's not the case, say, for example, in North America, which is obviously a much larger business where the legacy base price is more consistent with the price that we get today.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And just to illustrate Rod's point, it's typically in the UK, you see prices in p that you see in cents in the U.S. Now that was even more interesting before the Brexit. But anyway, so you do see this range in terms of the high legacy pricing in Europe.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. That's helpful and that makes sense. And then my second question is really just a clarification just to make sure that we have the right numbers. With the accelerated synergy benefits, it looks like for 2016 now you've got $18 million in net synergy benefit versus $15 million previously. But 2017 is still the same $80 million net synergy target, is that right? And then what's the ultimate synergy target? That still is unchanged at $105 million?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. What we've always said is that \u2013 that was a minimum synergy target and we'll see as we get closer to 2017 and into 2017 if that speed also translates into more. Right now, it's speed. But I think we've always said that once we start really understanding the consolidation opportunity, that could be more, but right now, I would keep your $17 million guidance in the overall synergy number where it is. But yes, so the \u2013 you're absolutely right. It's about speed right now.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.","I think that's right, Bill. I think at this stage, it's sort of bit of upside this year, sets us up great for next year in terms of confidence around that number, but no change in the total yet for 2017. The big item we're looking at the moment is real estate consolidation, which we've always called out as a potential upside further down the line, but it's still early days in terms of the analysis there. There will be an update in quarters to come on that.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Okay, that makes sense, thank you.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, well, thank you very much, and I hope you all enjoy the rest of your summer.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 2013 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn today's call over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. Ms. Marsden, you may begin your conference.","Melissa Marsden","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. And this morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and strategic initiatives; followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. Stephen Golden, VP, IR, is also with us today. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.","Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2013 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill Meaney.","William L. Meaney","Thank you, Melissa, and many -- and my thanks to everyone joining us today, and good morning. Our second quarter results reflect our focus on sustaining the durability of the business in supporting our future growth. Total revenues were $755 million, adjusted OIBDA was $233 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.29 per share. These amounts include a $5 million legal accrual noted in our press release.","Prior to this accrual, our financial performance was in line with our expectations for both the quarter and the year-to-date. Operating performance is also tracking in line with our expectations, with consistent storage rental constant dollar growth of 3% and storage rental internal growth of 2.3% for the quarter. As we've indicated in recent quarters, the trend towards lower levels of retrieval and refile activity and related transportation services in developed markets continues. But also as expected, service declines moderated somewhat during the second quarter, and our solid storage rental revenue growth continued to offset service declines and support our consistent profit results.","Overall, our full year outlook for operating performance remains the same, aside from the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","Before Brian reviews our financial performance, I'd like to discuss our initiatives to continue to support the durability of our core business and the growth opportunities we're seeing in both our developed and emerging markets and progress on our plans to convert to a REIT.","As a reminder, when I refer to developed markets for Iron Mountain, that includes not only our North American markets of Canada and the United States, but Australia and the U.K. as well. It also includes Western Europe, where our team continues to deliver solid results, with good volume growth and improved profitability. This is despite a lackluster macroeconomic environment across Europe.","As I mentioned last quarter, our strategy to sustain the durability of the business in our developed markets includes 3 elements. One, tailoring our sales and marketing efforts to focus on vertical markets and add value for customers through industry-specific solutions.","Two is differentiating our core storage and service offerings with innovative tools that drive incremental storage from existing customers, as well as attracting new customers.","And three, acquisition opportunities driven by ongoing consolidation in our industry.","With respect to the first of these elements, we've worked through the realignment of our sales and marketing organizations to focus on verticals. This transition has taken some time to implement, but we're beginning to see results. For example, our focus on the health care market in North America is driving storage rental in this vertical, offsetting declines in query-driven service activity. We continue to see this dynamic in the second quarter, with health care storage rental up roughly 3% year-to-date versus last year. Being aligned along vertical markets also is permitting us to extend our reach into related segments such as life sciences. While our foray into this segment is more recent, we are seeing good interest from both new and existing customers, driving increases in project-related complementary services, as well as about a 3.5% increase in storage rental year-to-date.","We also have seen a nice pickup in new business bookings in this vertical segment, although the related volume will not be reflected in this year's results.","Overall, we continue to identify ways to leverage our industry-specific expertise and bring best practices to bear. As we do this, we are having more conversations deeper within our customers' organizations in increasing the potential to drive incremental business.","In addition to our vertical market approach, we are continuing to differentiate our core storage and service offerings as a means to tap the un-vended market. Consistent with this approach is our Archival Tape Management offering, which is a solution within our data protection business that helps companies manage data from legacy systems. Given the fast pace of growth in electronic data and the speed of change in technology, most companies have a tiered system of data storage. They seek to balance having the right amount of data protected in the right format, in the right place and at the right time against the cost of storing that data.","Tape backup is often the second, third and even fourth line of defense and remains the most cost-effective way to move data off-site and store it for long periods of time. This service, which we just launched in April, provides quick, reliable access to archival tapes for customers even after they've shut down legacy systems. It also provides encryption of legacy data for compliance purposes and protects it from inadvertent disclosures. This data protection offering promotes discussion with customers in the un-vended space, and we're encouraged by a couple of early wins.","We also continue to expand our business in developed markets through active and attractive fold-in acquisitions. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 3 records management businesses owned by Texas-based Information Storage Consolidation Company, expanding our presence in Eastern Michigan, Dallas and Southeast Florida. This acquisition adds midsized organizations to our customer roster and is consistent with our strategy for sustaining the durability of our storage business in developed markets where we continue to have a solid pipeline of active deals.","We are also pursuing a number of interesting opportunities to expand our platform in high-growth emerging markets through both organic growth and accretive acquisitions that meet our financial hurdles. Customers in these markets often are just beginning to outsource their records management, and we see a significant opportunity to provide storage and related services that can help them become more efficient and reduce costs.","Again, we define emerging markets to include the BRIC countries, in addition to other Latin American markets, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific markets such as Hong Kong. These emerging markets currently represent about 10% of total annual revenues, or about a $300 million business for us, and we have a number of attractive acquisitions and joint venture opportunities throughout these regions. We believe our emerging market expansion will be an engine for future growth, as demonstrated by strong storage-rental constant-dollar growth in these markets of 13% in the second quarter.","As we've previously noted, achieving leadership in our international markets drives improved efficiencies similar to those in our developed markets. However, we manage our International business as a portfolio, so our ongoing acquisition activity and entry into new markets naturally tempers our ability to continue to post significant further margin improvement in the near term. That said, we are very pleased with our progress on International margin improvement goal during the quarter, achieving 24.6% for the year-to-date. This represents a 280-basis-points improvement over the first half of last year and is a significant accomplishment for our International team.","In terms of business adjacencies, we are making progress with plans to accelerate the expansion of our underground wholesale data center in Pennsylvania that we talked about on our last call. We are developing our pipeline and continue to evaluate opportunities for incremental investment in this business.","Finally, let me touch on the REIT. As I'm sure you are all aware, we've been advancing our preparations for conversion, including seeking Private Letter Rulings, or PLRs, from the IRS. In early June, we disclosed in an 8-K filing that we have been notified by the IRS that it had formed a working group to study the legal definition of real estate as it relates to REITs. We also said that as a result, we expected ruling from some of our PLR requests, as well as the PLR requests from other companies on similar issues, to be delayed until the IRS completes its study, which might take us beyond the approximate 1 year time line we have talked about since mid-July of last year.","Obviously, we are beyond that time frame. We felt it was important to disclose the delay and also to disclose that prior to the IRS pressing the pause button, it had indicated to us that it was tentatively adverse to ruling that our racking structures are real estate for REIT purposes. We also stated that it is not unusual to receive this type of preliminary indication as part of the PLR process.","We understand that the resolution of these issues is top of mind for all of you as well. However, we ask you to please understand that we are not providing any updates for you today with regard to the scope of the IRS working group study, the timing of the study, nor the tentatively adverse indication. For those of you on the call not familiar with this matter, I encourage you to refer to the 8-K filing from 6 June, which includes other details as well as risk factors. Given this lack of certainty with respect to the timing and our focus on conversion, we plan to break from tradition and will host our next investor day in March 2014, as opposed to our typical mid-October time frame.","Despite this unforeseen delay, we feel good about our position with respect to our racking structures as real estate under our interpretation of the current standards, and this delay doesn't change our plans to move forward with those preparations we can control to ensure our readiness for conversion in January 2014. For example, on our targeted date of 1 July, we successfully migrated our REIT-critical IT systems and processes to a new platform that enables us to operate internally as a REIT for a period of time before we officially elect REIT status. This was a massive undertaking, and I wish to thank publicly all of our cross functional teams who were successful in meeting this tight interim deadline. These system enhancements will allow greater efficiencies and provide a robust foundation for future growth. And you may see us undertake additional steps necessary to support conversion while we await clarity on the PLR, all in the name of being prepared as we possibly can to convert in 2014.","Of course, we can make no assurances we'll be successful in converting. But we believe we fit well as a REIT due to the attractive characteristics of our business, such as the quality and durability of our storage rental net operating income, our high rental revenue per square foot, the low volatility throughout economic ups and downs, the high credit quality and the high retention customer base, as well as relatively low maintenance and turnover costs.","But whilst the REIT structure complements our strategy, our strategy for sustaining the durability of our business is not dependent upon the REIT. Our business generates strong, consistent cash flow in excess of what we require to invest in people, processes and platforms to support our long-term growth. Our targeted level for investment in emerging markets, acquisitions and adjacencies is approximately 25% to 35% of our free cash flow, and we believe this would be similar under our existing structure or as a REIT. It is a level that is consistent with our capital allocation approach through which we seek to maximize cash flow, and it leaves us with significant excess free cash flow to support attractive stockholder payouts.","Our business is solid with great fundamentals, and we have a strategy to support growth and sustain the durability of our core storage rental business. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss our financial results in more detail.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Bill. Let's turn now to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered good operating results in Q2, in line with our expectations, reflecting consistent storage rental growth and solid profit performance, supported by international margin gains. Overall, our growth trends were consistent. Storage rental grew 3% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by consistent gains in North America and 7% growth in International, including benefits from recent acquisitions in Brazil, France and North America.","Durable storage gains continue to be partially offset by declines in query-based core service activity. Core service growth declines improved relative to Q1, as expected, reflecting more favorable comparisons in international markets but remain a headwind to our overall growth. Underlying adjusted OIBDA performance was solid in Q2, supported by continued international margin gains and sustained cost controls.","Our Q2 and year-to-date adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results were impacted by a legal accrual recorded in the quarter of $5 million or $0.02 per share. Excluding the legal accrual impact, adjusted OIBDA is up 1% year-to-date, in line with our full year goals.","Today, we're updating our full year 2013 performance outlook to reflect changes in FX exchange rates since the beginning of the year. The strengthening of the dollar since the beginning of the year is projected to reduce full-year reported revenues between 1% and 1.5%, with relatively similar impacts in adjusted OIBDA. I'll speak more to these updates later in my remarks.","Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the second quarter of 2012. As noted, Q2 results were as expected. Enterprise revenues grew 1.3% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continued to produce strong revenue performance. International posted 5% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 7% storage rental growth, including benefits from our recent acquisitions in Brazil and France. North America posted flat constant currency revenue growth, as 2% storage rental gains were offset by lower core service revenues. Foreign exchange rate changes reduced revenue growth by 0.5% in the quarter.","Adjusted OIBDA was $233 million or basically flat compared to last year's Q2, excluding the $5 million legal accrual. A key driver of profit performance was the continued improvement in our International segment, consistent with our plans. International adjusted OIBDA increased 25% year-on-year in Q2, reflecting strong top line growth and continued margin gains. Savings from North America cost improvement initiatives mitigated impacts from core service revenue declines.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share compared to $0.37 in Q2 2012. Adjusting for the $0.02 per share impact of the legal accrual I described earlier, adjusted EPS would have been $0.31 per share. The year-on-year decrease was due primarily to 20 million additional shares outstanding, including those issued as part of our special dividend last November.","Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, which reduced reported EPS by $0.08 per share net of tax.","GAAP earnings per share of $0.14 includes $24 million of REIT costs and $15 million of other expense, partially offset by $2 million of gains on asset dispositions. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39%.","Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q2 growth rates were in line with our expectations and our full year outlook. Our storage rental business remains durable, providing a solid foundation for overall revenue performance. For the quarter, consistent storage rental growth of 3% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance and supported total constant dollar revenue growth of 1.3%. Year-on-year global net volume growth was 1.4%.","North America reported 1.8% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat records management volume, average records management pricing gains of 1.2% and benefits from our recent acquisition. North American pricing gains were slightly lower in Q2 than recent trends, reflecting impacts from prior year comparisons. For the full year, we expect pricing gains to be approximately 1.5%.","International storage rental growth of 6.6% constant dollar for the quarter reflected sustained double-digit growth in emerging markets. For the year, we expect overall storage rental to sustain consistent growth rates of about 3% on a constant dollar basis. Total services decreased 1% constant dollar as International service growth was offset by North American service revenue declines, reflecting lower activity-based core services and related transportation activity. Gains in DMS and increased project revenues in both North America and International helped to offset these impacts.","Paper prices had limited impact in Q2 as lower average prices were partially offset by increased volume in North America. At current paper price levels, which are down 12% year-on-year, however, we will see some pressure on this front moving forward, which will constrain overall service gains. Overall total internal growth was 0.5%, as 2.3% gains in storage rental more than offset service pressures.","Let's take a look at our segment performance on Slide 6. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date 2013 performance compared to last year. In terms of our key financial metrics, we delivered results that reflect consistent business trends and have us on track to achieve our full year financial goals. Reported revenue of $1.5 billion was up 1% on a constant dollar basis, driven by solid storage gains. Adjusted OIBDA was flat year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. As noted earlier, excluding the $5 million legal accrual, adjusted OIBDA grew 1%, reflecting North America cost efficiencies and International margin improvement.","Adjusted EPS was $0.56 per share, down 15% compared to the first half of last year, reflecting the impact of additional shares issued in connection with the special dividend last November, higher interest expense associated with shareholder payouts and the legal accrual noted earlier. These impacts more than offset lower income tax expense in the period.","First half capital spending was $86 million, excluding $20 million of real estate and $14 million of REIT conversion CapEx. As a percentage of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate and REIT CapEx, is 5.7% of sales, in line with our full year plans. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2013 was $154 million compared to $117 million for the same period last year. The year-on-year increase reflects lower cash taxes, which were partially offset by higher capital spending. The 2013 year-to-date adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results shown here exclude $49 million of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced reported EPS by about $0.18. Note that 2012 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS excludes $5 million of these costs and reduces reported EPS by $0.02 per share.","In addition to the $14 million of REIT-related CapEx I just discussed, we paid $28 million in taxes towards our D&A recapture liability. All told, these items would reduce free cash flow by about $76 million year-to-date. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT cost and related expenditures in the appendix of the presentation.","Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 key segments. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segment, while we continue to build our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. For the first half of 2013, our North American business segment reported revenues of $1.1 billion, supported by consistent 2% constant dollar storage rental gains. We sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%, as SG&A savings offset pressures from lower service revenues. We're also sustaining capital efficiencies, with spending at 4.6% of revenues, excluding real estate.","Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenues, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 17% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from solid global growth and cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets. International adjusted OIBDA margins have expanded 280 basis points year-to-date, keeping us on track towards our goal of about 25% International segment margins in 2013.","Finally, corporate expenses were up compared to prior year levels, impacted by the $5 million legal accrual.","Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 8. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was nearly $800 million, with $259 million in cash and $535 million in additional borrowing capacity. We are currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 4.1x, just above the high end of our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio was increased over the past 2-plus years as planned to support shareholder payouts of $1.7 billion and expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT over that period. As we stated previously, the costs associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily push our leverage over the high end of our target range.","Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. During the first half of the year, we paid $103 million in cash dividends and $90 million of REIT costs, including REIT-related CapEx and tax payments related to the depreciation recapture. As we mentioned in our recently filed 8-K, we expect to engage in some financing transactions in Q3, including amending our senior credit facility. We're currently working on that amendment and expect to complete the process shortly. The scope and timing of any additional financing activities is still to be determined, and we'll keep you abreast of these transactions as they develop.","We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders, and we remain well positioned to fund our business plan. That concludes our review of the Q2 2013 results.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our 2013 outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our updated full year 2013 operating outlook. While our business trends and operating fundamentals are consistent, today, we're updating our full year 2013 guidance to reflect FX rate changes. Changes in FX rates since the beginning of the year are driving a projected reduction in reported revenues of more than $40 million or between 1% and 1.5% for the full year. Adjusted OIBDA will be similarly impacted on a percentage basis. We're now expecting full year revenues to be about $3,000,000,000 to $3,050,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA to be between $900 million and $925 million. We're also updating our expectations for adjusted EPS to reflect the FX changes, as well as updated estimates for interest in D&A related to recent acquisitions. We're not including any impacts from potential future refinancing activities, as the scope and timing of those transactions are not final. We'll update our outlook as appropriate on the next earnings call.","As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant onetime operating and capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other costs to implement the proposed structure. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline, and several of our REIT-critical systems are now operating on a test basis. For the year, we expect to incur between $65 million and $95 million of incremental expense. The impact of these costs will be a reduction on reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36 per share.","Today, we're also updating our estimate for the earnings and profit distribution related -- to reflect a more detailed assessment of our International profits in countries targeted for conversion in 2014. As you know, successful conversion to a REIT requires that we distribute all of our accumulated earnings and profits related to countries converted to shareholders by the end of our first year as a REIT. Based on updated information and additional analysis, we now expect our total distribution to be between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, of which $700 million was paid out in 2012.","Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the REIT-related items, are included in the appendix. That concludes our review.","In summary, Q2 was a quarter of solid financial performance, and we're well positioned to achieve our full year financial goals. We continue to execute against our business plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we continue to advance work in connection with the proposed REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Storage volumes growth this quarter, it appears decelerated from the prior several quarters. How much of this was driven by reduced growth benefits from your acquisition of Grupo Store in Brazil versus a fundamental change in volume trends that you're seeing?","Brian P. McKeon","The acquisition impact was the primary driver. We completed the Grupo Store acquisition in Q2 of last year, and so we're completing the benefit that we got from that relatively larger acquisition. The fundamental trends in the rest of the business, very similar. The -- as we noted actually, the service growth rate improved a bit on a comparable basis. We knew we had some unfavorable lapping last quarter that we worked through. And basically, our storage growth rates were consistent. I did note that the North America pricing number was a little bit lower than we've been, and that's more of a year-on-year comparison. We're expecting kind of 1.5% net pricing gains in records management in North America for the full year and for the back half.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you're seeing improving trends in the services business. Do you expect to see services revenue declines to continue to moderate throughout the year? And any chance services growth can turn positive on a constant currency basis?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, it's a good question. I would say the trends are similar. I think we -- it's a relatively better growth. It was down 1% constant dollar and that's more -- better than Q1, largely because Q1 had some comparison issues. We are seeing benefits from our growth in things like DMS and project-related revenue and continued expansion in the International business. We did note that the paper pricing has moved lower, so it was -- the SOP market price is now down to $138 a ton. And that will be a headwind back half of the year. So I'd be cautious about signaling an improvement because we're facing that dynamic. But overall, relatively similar trends and we're hoping that we can move this in a relatively more positive direction over time, as we continue to build out these other service lines and grow our international presence.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Hey, Brian, can you give us a little more background on the $5 million legal accrual that we got in the quarter?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, we tend to not want to get into specifics on legal accruals, but we had a customer dispute that's been going on for a number of years, goes back a number of years, I should say, in terms of the time period we're looking at. And we're booking accrual related to that. It's not anything that is operationally oriented. And just given the size of it, Kevin, that's sort of a cumulative effect of something that's kind of impacted a number of years, it was large enough for us to highlight that so that we don't give you a distorted view of what our underlying operational trends are. But it's relatively unusual and just it's related more to a customer agreement.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then I just want to make sure, and I think I heard you right, but the incremental step up in the E&P, that was all International? Because it -- in terms of the step up, because I think the range, if I had it right, was kind of $300 million to $800 million, now it's an incremental $500 million to $1 billion. That was kind of all International true up? Or it had nothing to do with potentially going out to 2015 on the REIT conversion, right?","Brian P. McKeon","Just to clarify the numbers, we originally had $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and we're taking it to $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion, so it's a $200 million increase. And it reflects -- just more detailed. As you might imagine, it's a complicated exercise trying to go back in time and calculate the exact kind of cumulative earnings and profits by country of what we've earned over time, and the increase reflects updated estimates for the International business. There isn't a change in terms of the time frame we're looking at. This is related to the countries that we anticipate converting in 2014 with our initial wave one, if you will, and assuming we're successful with the REIT process.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then just any sense of timing from when you'll hear back from the IRS, just given the decision to move the investor day? Is that kind of a reasonable proxy that we should hear before the investor day, or around that, any sense of timing on when we'll get some type of clarity?","William L. Meaney","Kevin, we can't really say anything more than we've already said in the 8-K. So we just moved the investor day because we felt that doing it in October, if we haven't got clarity one way or the other, it would be a bit early to do that. So -- but I wouldn't read anything into it because we can't say more than we've already told you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Shui with Stifel Nicolaus.","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you guys give us the North America...","William L. Meaney","Steven, can you speak up? Because we can't hear you.","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you guys give us the North America volume growth number and talk about how that's been trending versus expectations?","Brian P. McKeon","Sure, the volume growth was down 0.2%, so relatively flat, consistent with recent trends and consistent with expectations and where we are. We're advancing a number of initiatives, including the vertical initiatives that Bill can talk to, that our goal is to improve that rate over time. But I would say the underlying trend is consistent with where we've been.","William L. Meaney","Yes, there has -- it's almost dead on where we were for the year in 2012. But I think one of the reasons why we're talking about the verticals, and we highlighted 2 verticals where -- which are ones that we had stood up before we had made the major change, where we're actually showing positive storage growth, is because I think now, I think I've said on a previous call, is in the mature markets is that getting after the volume now is much more kind of underground mining, whereas before, maybe it was more like opencast. So we have to be much more precise and much more diligent. That being said, I will highlight that in every Western European country, we are in positive storage growth, on an internal basis. So it's -- the trend hasn't changed in North America, but we're making some changes along the vertical line to try to improve that performance.","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And assuming there's no word on the PLR by the beginning of 2014, how will that affect how you manage the business going into the year in terms of your IT and legal systems? And maybe you can also give us some color on if there's a plan B if the PLR comes back negative.","Brian P. McKeon","So on your first question, I think we are, as noted, continue to advance work to do -- to be ready for our Jan 1, 2014 goal, and the systems that we're putting in place in terms of financial systems, things of that nature, will have benefit for our business regardless, in terms of kind of standard platforms and kind of standardized ways of looking at information. It's actually accelerated investments that we would've made as a company over time. So we'll see benefits from that going forward. As Bill noted, we can't really speculate at this point on timing of a process, but we think it's prudent to continue to move forward with those investments, and we'll get benefit in our business overall. In terms of a plan B, if you will, so if we were in a position that we weren't moving forward with converting to a REIT, just to reinforce some things that we've said in the past, we would be pursuing, as a company, the same business and capital allocation strategy. We expect to generate -- continue to generate substantial cash flow. We've indicated that we estimate we'd have about 70% of our free cash flow, x real estate the way that we defined it publicly, available for distribution to shareholders. That's a longer-term kind of an average, assuming a moderate level of M&A investment, $100 million to $150 million a year. And obviously, we don't convert, we wouldn't have the benefit of some of the tax savings that come from that, the discipline associated with the REIT structure. But we'd still have substantial flexibility to support financial payouts. And we'd expect to do that through a combination of a growing dividend, which right now is about 60% of our free cash flow, and likely, some level of share repurchases. So we haven't defined that plan specifically. But directionally, it's the same business and capital allocation strategy, we continue to generate substantial cash flow and we'd be continuing to drive payouts to shareholders, including a growing dividend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Brian, correct me if I'm right about this in kind of footnote #1 of your 2013 outlook, which is now 0% to 2% internal growth. That is a little bit of a bump up from the last estimate we had, which included a negative 1 at the low end. What's caused this kind of lean forwards?","Brian P. McKeon","It's really rounding, Andrew. I think it's fundamentally the same outlook. We took the opportunity given the FX changes to kind of like fold through kind of relook overall. But I would say it's fundamentally the same outlook. We have -- we do have some incremental benefit from acquisition kind of flowing through. It's small, but it's nothing -- there isn't -- fundamentally, there isn't a change in sort of our operating outlook from where we were. It's consistent, excluding the FX changes.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, and what would be a D&A estimate for the year?","Brian P. McKeon","I think we have that in the slides for you. It's...","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I missed that.","Brian P. McKeon","It's in the final appendix numbers. Right now, it's...","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, I didn't get up to the appendix, yet. And then just to make sure we model the FX correctly. Because that's what you're calling out here. You called it $40 million for the year. How much will FX have as a drag on third and fourth quarter in terms of growth rates?","Brian P. McKeon","I believe it's about 1.5 points, 1 point to 1.5 points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering, so Brambles obviously announced that they're going to be spinning off Recall, as its own publicly traded entity. I guess my question is have you seen any change in strategy as they start to think about themselves as an independent entity? And also how does that maybe change the dynamic on the M&A opportunities that are out there, considering that they'll be infused with maybe a little bit more capital going forward?","William L. Meaney","Well, I think it's too early to tell. I mean they've just made their announcement, although the company, you can say, has been in play or under discussion for a while. I think that net-net, from our standpoint, it's a good thing because I think having a company that is not in the dressing up stage for sale but rather operating in the public markets like we are, then I think we would expect them to be competing on a purely rational basis, not looking towards a transaction. So I think that's always a good thing from our standpoint. I think -- it's the -- so I think net-net for us, it's a positive. Whether or not they will be more aggressive in terms of acquisitions, I mean, they've been aggressive in terms of acquisitions before. They've always been competing with us in the past, and there's other people that compete with us in acquisitions. So I think overall, we welcome them to the forum of being a public company.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then Brian, just a quick one. What was the EBITDA contribution from the acquisitions that you completed this quarter? Do you have a number for this year or maybe a full year run rate?","Brian P. McKeon","It's small for the full year. Acquisitions year-to-date, it's about $2 million additive. So it's -- and that's net of the initial integration cost. Obviously, those get more accretive over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Brian, in the press release, it calls out the declines in service revenue moderating, one of the reasons being increased special records management project volume. Could you take us a level deeper on that, and if it's a trend that could persist?","Brian P. McKeon","Well, it's been a focus area for us for a while, but I think as we've -- it's early on, but as we increase the focus around serving vertical segments and having our sales organization aligned with them, I think we're identifying opportunities to customers, not just through storage, but through some transitions that they work in terms of how they're managing their organization. So it is something that we're hopeful to be a continued positive trend. And it's consistent with our business focus. So I think the -- I do want to reinforce, the kind of the main change from Q1 to Q2 is kind of get working through some tough lapping. We had some customer losses that we worked, in shredding in International, we worked through some of those things. But look, we're encouraged with their progress on their front, and we do have some ongoing headwinds that are -- kind of constrain growth. The query-based service activity continues to be a challenge, and right now, paper will be a bit of a challenge. But overall, we feel good that we're on the right track with the strategy.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just looking across your major verticals, legal, health care, could you give us a feel -- and others, could you give us a feeling as to just trends within them, and in particular, health care?","William L. Meaney","Well, I think in health care, I highlighted in the remarks that we're seeing about a 3% year-on-year growth in storage. But I think that if you look at the services, we continue to feel the headwinds. Because the service mainly, historically, in health care has been about active file or in terms of retrieving -- when hospitals need to retrieve people's medical files. And of course, that's going electronic. So what we've done now with the vertical is we've gone into new areas and mined deeper within the health care client -- customers, helping them make themselves paperless in their operations and get the paper out of there and stored properly. So much more of an archival trend. But as you see, it's -- we're getting significant year-on-year improvement in terms of the amount of storage volume we're getting. And I think I highlighted in the last call, bear in mind also that margin for us on storage is about 2x what it is on the service. So we continue to see a trend towards the electronic medical record, which takes away some of the service revenue that we had before on active file. But at the same time, we're getting into new areas, and helping our customers store even more offsite, and we like those trends.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Anything notably outstanding in legal or financial services, or has that been fairly consistent with the past?","William L. Meaney","That's been pretty much consistent in the past. Those are 2 areas where the vertical -- we've stood up the verticals this year, so they're relatively new in those areas. So it's too early to really say how that is progressing. But I think, right now, it's trending pretty much consistent with the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Berg with Post Advisory Group.","Andrew Berg - Post Advisory Group, LLC","Two questions, just housekeeping. Going back to the legal accrual, that goes back over how many years?","Brian P. McKeon","It's over a decade.","Andrew Berg - Post Advisory Group, LLC","Okay. And with respect to realigning the sales force in the different verticals, is that completed now across all verticals or are you still rolling that out among some?","William L. Meaney","It's pretty much completed, but the one thing I just want to highlight is it's work in progress. Because as we stood them up, we look at making sure that we've picked the right verticals and we're getting the benefits that we want. So yes, we have done the realignment and we've set the organization up, but it's one of these things where we have clear metrics around each of those and we continue to evaluate them.","Andrew Berg - Post Advisory Group, LLC","And from the ones you did earlier to the ones you did most recently, how much of a differential in performance are you seeing?","William L. Meaney","Well, I think the 2 that I've highlighted, the ones that's been up the longest, which is both life sciences and health care, and we're seeing, as I said 3%, roughly 3% to 3.5% year-on-year storage growth in those 2. Overall in North America, as Brian highlighted earlier, we're down about 0.2% in terms of physical storage growth year-on-year. So you can see the difference that we're getting in those 2. But I'm not going to try to -- I think it would be dangerous to extrapolate across the board. But that's -- we are -- it is one, and it's not the only thing we're doing, but it is one of the things that we're doing to try to mimic similar performance that we're getting out of mature markets in Europe in terms of physical storage growth. As I said, this is much more like going from opencast mining to underground mining. Part of the tools and the drills that we're deploying to get at the -- get at the storage revenue is this verticalization of the sales and marketing groups.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn today's call back over to your presenters for closing remarks.","William L. Meaney","Thank you, operator. To wrap up, our 2013 performance is on track. It's driven by the consistent growth in our storage rental business. And we believe we have numerous opportunities to sustain that growth in both developed and emerging markets through our vertical market focus, our innovative tools and services that drive incremental opportunities and attractive acquisitions. And we continue to make progress on preparations for our planned conversion to a REIT. As we move forward through the year and sharpen our focus on the key drivers of value for our business, we will, as always, continue to focus on prudent capital allocation, maximizing total returns and delivering sustainable value to our shareholders.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Greer Aviv","Thank you, Kate. Hello, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that we will refer to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with a link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation, earnings press release and the full supplemental financial information at ironmountain.com under about us\/investors\/events and presentations.","On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss first quarter performance and progress towards our strategic plans; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover additional financial information and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to Q&A. Referring now to the Page 2 of the presentation. Today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and a reconciliations to these measures as required by Reggie are included in the supplemental financial information.","With that, Bill, would you please begin.","William Meaney","Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. The first quarter of 2019 was marked by continued progress against our strategic plan. Some of the highlights included: revenue growth ahead of our expectations, solid global volume performance from our traditional records business, progress and increasing our exposure to new storage areas, in part highlighted by the recently announced MakeSpace JV in the consumer storage area and continued build out of our data center business. Tempering this progress was the underperformance of adjusted EBITDA against our expectations for the quarter of - by approximately $10 million. We should emphasize, however, we remain confident in achieving our budget expectations in line with the full year guidance targets we issued in February.","Continuing from this summary in a little bit more detail, as you saw in our earnings materials, revenue growth in record storage volumes continued to be very durable with total revenues increasing 4.5% on a constant currency basis, whilst our organic storage revenue grew 2% consistent with the 1.9% organic storage growth recorded in Q4.","Our revenue performance was slightly ahead of our expectations due to strong volume and revenue management and despite softer service revenue, we expect total revenue to remain on track with our outlook for the year. Separately, we experienced higher-than-anticipated labor cost, which are temporary in our secured destruction or shred business. This was the single biggest contributor to our adjusted EBITDA underperforming our expectations by $10 million or 3% for the quarter.","Let me give you a bit more color what led to the earnings results this quarter. Our performance remains on track with our expectations in the first 2 months of the year with our underperformance occurring primarily in our shred business during the month of March. Shred increased head count in an overall attempt to reduce overtime that we did not achieve the reduction necessary to deliver the targeted level, which resulted in unanticipated higher labor costs. Our confidence in delivering full year guidance is in part driven from the investment we made at the beginning of the year in our global operations support team. This team is tasked with driving improvement in both operating in overhead cost globally. As a number of these improvements continue in their implementation, we expect it will ultimately lead to more of a marked improvement and performance in the second half of the year. Moreover, we believe a number of these initiatives will result in a stronger exit rate than we initially planned.","From a strategic standpoint, this implies we expect to exit 2019 with an organic adjusted EBITDA growth rate of approximately 4.5% and on track towards our target of 5% for the end of 2020. Stuart will provide more detail around our expectation for the rest of the year including other items impacting comparability.","After adjusting out the $10 million of the unfavorable cost performance, you'll see that the first quarter corporate overhead cost increases year-over-year as we continue to invest in operational improvement as well as continued investment in innovation and new product development. These investments are in some areas already leading to both the identification of areas for improved cost performance and revenue opportunities, which should continue to both drive future growth in earnings and fund our growth in dividends to investors.","Our recent example of the - one recent example this could be seen in our continued progress with our insight platform and partnership with Google. 3 weeks ago, at Google Next, Google awarded Iron Mountain its artificial intelligence and machine learning partner of the year. We are proud of receiving this award in an area so important in the realm of information management.","Let me now turn to volume performance in the quarter as well as changes to our volume reporting, which can be seen in our quarterly earnings supplement. As Stuart mentioned last quarter, we took a fresh look at our disclosures to streamline where possible as well has insured we are providing our shareholders and analysts value-added information to properly evaluate our businesses and related performance. We revised our volume recording to better reflect how we manage the business and provide visibility into our comprehensive portfolio of physical storage solutions above and beyond records including Tape, Valet Consumer Storage and our Adjacent Businesses of fine arts storage and entertainment services. Whilst the non-box storage currently only represents approximately 1% of our storage volume, we believe these areas have the opportunity to represent a significant amount of growth going forward.","Turning to our actual volume results for Q1. By all measures, it was a solid quarter for volume growth. First, let me focus on organic volume growth from our traditional records management business. In the first quarter globally, our cubic feet of record storage increased from 686 million cubic feet a year ago to 696 million cubic feet with $2.4 million of the $10 million cubic organic, delivering 30 basis points of the year-over-year growth.","Moreover, during the first quarter, we delivered growth of 3 million cubic feet organically or increase of 40 basis points. Breaking the worldwide volume down further, we continued to see a consistent trend in North America with a decline of 130 basis points year-over-year. This is a slight improvement from recent quarters due to lower destructions and flat Q4 to Q1 organically.","Western Europe and other international continue to deliver consistent levels of organic volume growth, 2% and 3%, respectively year-over-year.","Turning to our new reporting of storage volume achieved form Adjacent Businesses, primarily fine arts and entertainment services and consumer, we have routinely included these businesses when reporting or revenue per square foot and occupancy, but not in our volume reporting. Starting this year, we will also provide a breakdown of the volume stored in these businesses. You can see in our reporting that these businesses while small have delivered approximately 5 million cubic feet of net growth over the last 2 years, representing 20% of the overall volume growth for the company.","Moreover, we see the volume contribution of these businesses accelerating as we continue to build further scale in these relatively new storage areas for Iron Mountain. A good example of this growth potential is illustrated by our recent expansion in the consumer through the partnership with MakeSpace. We're excited about the opportunity to serve as a logistics and storage arm in the valet consumer space. This venture combines the strongest capabilities from both of our organizations that leverage is MakeSpace a strong brand and front end customer acquisition technology platform with our world-class operational scales and logistics expertise. Iron Mountain has the opportunity to accelerate growth in the consumer market the MakeSpace's strong market position and ambition to expand into new markets.","Finally, we continue to make steady progress in our data center business. You will see in this quarter, we signed a new or expanded leases for almost 4 megawatts versus the 3.3 megawatts in Q4 on a total build out capacity of a little over 100 megawatts. Whilst today, data center is about 6% of total revenue, it is already contributing more than a third of our annual EBITDA growth.","Before handing the call over to Stuart, I wish to reiterate that we remain confident in the health of the underlying business characterized by the growth in revenue from our records and information management business as well as the increased momentum of our growth portfolio including Emerging Markets and data center. While we're disappointed by the cost impact this quarter, we continue to see the full year in line with our guidance and with an expected slightly improved exit rate going into 2020.","With that, I will turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart Brown","Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. I'll start off the details around Q1 performance, with additional information around the cost control issues and overall results, including the initiatives you're taking to expand margins and deliver on your expectations for the remainder of the year. Slide 7 of the presentation summarizes our quarter's financial results. As Bill mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter revenue, which approach $1.1 billion, reflecting growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Storage rental revenue increased 5.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in our data center, emerging markets and fine arts businesses and better organic volume performance.","Service revenue increased 3.5% excluding currency changes. Total organic revenue grew by 1.9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Organic storage revenue grew 2% for the quarter or about $13 million, supported by good results by an revenue management and from organic records management volume growth, which increased 30 basis points in the quarter and acceleration for prior quarters.","Organic service revenue grew by 1.8% in the first quarter, a bit less than we anticipated to the lower box destructions in North America, lower project revenue globally and lower prices for recycled paper.","The gross profit margin declined 70 basis point from last year to 56.3%, due in part to the operational issues Bill discussed as well as a 20 basis points impact in the change in lease accounting. I'll have more on the cost actions we're undertaking in a moment.","Our adjusted EBITDA declined $18.5 million or 5.4% to $325 million, with the margins contracting 210 basis points year-over-year to 30.8%. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA declined $8.7 million or 2.6%.","In addition to the cost of sales already discussed, the margin contraction reflects SG&A excluding significant acquisition costs, growing 140 basis points as a percentage of revenue or almost $18 million from the year-ago. The increase in SG&A reflects higher IT-related costs, including information security and investments in our digital offerings like the Iron Mountain insight platform and partnership with Google. We also invested in a new global operational support group and added G&A with last year's data center acquisitions. Most of this increase in SG&A was anticipated and reflects strategic initiatives and reflect the future.","Turning to other metrics, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.17 per share, down from $0.24 per share a year ago. AFFO in the quarter was $193 million, down approximately $28 million from the prior year, reflecting the adjusted EBITDA decline, increased interest expense and slightly higher cash taxes compared to a year ago.","Looking at organic revenue growth on Slide 8. You can see developed markets organic storage, rental revenue came in at 1.1% for the quarter, slightly better than Q4 2018, reflecting contribution from revenue management and improved volume performance. Organic service revenue in developed markets increased 1.8% for the quarter, a moderation from the levels seen in 2018, due mainly to lower destruction service revenues, paper prices which have moderated from recent highs and one fewer working day in the quarter.","In other international, we saw continued healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.6% for the quarter and 3.3% growth in organic volume. Organic service revenue declined 0.6% in this segment, due mainly to a slowdown in project revenue.","In the supplemental, you can see the data center business delivered organic revenue growth of around 3% for the quarter. Adjusted for the churn in Phoenix, we called out that last quarter, the underlying organic revenue growth was about 9% similar to levels seen in Q4. Churn in the quarter was about 1.4%, when normalized with a phoenix moveouts, which were anticipated when we acquired IO last year.","As Bill mentioned, we're trending well towards our target of leasing 15 to 20 megawatts for the year. Aggregated data center leasing in the quarter and the related rate per kilowatt included 1.6 megawatts of powered shell in New Jersey, space which was vacant when we acquired IO.","Our Adjacent Businesses also performed well, with revenue growing 10% on an organic basis in the quarter. With the international scale, we have now built, we continue to see very healthy demand from galleries museums and studios.","Slide 9 details the adjusted EBITDA margin performance our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, total margins were impacted by the increase in SG&A. The North America RIM margin declined by about 40 basis points largely because of our shredding business, as previously discussed, while the changes in lease accounting impact margin and a segment about 20 basis points this quarter. North America data management margin declined continues to be driven by lower volumes and investments we're making a new products and services, including Iron Mountain. Revenue management is helping to offset some of the declines support healthy margins, which remain above 50%.","In Western Europe, first quarter margins contracted 230 basis points, reflecting higher temporary facilities cost and consulting cost for process improvements in France. Other international margins were up 10 basis points in the quarter, despite a 70 basis point impact from the adoption of new lease accounting standards. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 42.3% in the first quarter, reflecting the acquisition of EvoSwitch in the Netherlands last May, which operates at lower average margins and the impact of the Phoenix churn, which as mentioned, was anticipated.","Turning to Slide 10. You can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio at Q1 was 5.8x, modestly higher than the year-end primarily due to the softer adjusted EBITDA performance. We expect levers to decline in the back half of the year, the capital recycling proceeds and expectations for increase adjusted EBITDA and to end the year around 5.5x as we guided to last quarter. We're on track with our capital recycling program and subsequent to the end of the first quarter, close to a number of real estate sales, generating net proceeds of over $40 million as we consolidate into our new U.K. records facility.","We've spent more than $15 million of additional risk that capital for the remainder of the year and are evaluating third-party capital via joint venture to fund the Frankfurt data center development.","Before discussing outlook, I want to take a moment to outline the plan to improve margins this year and set us up for success in 2020 and beyond. First, we've been in place over 2 dozen operating initiatives. Without going into details on all of the initiatives, 1 example is improving transportation costs both routing and fleet utilization. This was result in higher-than-previously-anticipated expense in Q2, there's one time in nature but should reduce fate and transportation cost in the back of the year and continuing to 2020. Other steps being taken include further labor initiatives and vendor consolidation to reduce supply costs.","Second, as previously discussed, we created a global operations support team at the end of last year to identify areas of improvement, focused and additional your labor, transportation cost in revenue management. This includes expanding the use of productivity management tools, with engineered labor standards to improve service margins globally as well as the centralization and standardization of transportation training. The first half of 2019 includes cost to establish the team and some third-party professional fees, and we expect to see the benefits in our results beginning in the second half of the year and into 2020.","Turning to guidance. We're reaffirming the range that we provided in your Q4 call in February and remain confident that we can achieve despite the first quarter performance expected residual effect on the second quarter and headwinds from declining recycled paper prices. The operating lower end of our guidance remains a little wider due to uncertainty with regard to exchange rates.","We continue to expect a total organic revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 2.5% in 2019, including organic storage revenue growth of 1.75% to 2.5%. We continue to expect service organic revenue growth in the low single digits, though the second quarter will be flattish as we are cycling against tire destruction service revenue in much higher paper prices. While we not generally provide quarterly guidance, given the cost issues experienced towards the end of the first quarter, we wanted to provide some further color on our expectations for the rest of the year. We expect some of the higher labor costs to secure destruction will continue into the second quarter until our actions, which are already underway, again improving cost of sales. We also expect some onetime cost associated with the operational improvement initiatives, I described earlier. However, SG&A cost should decline sequentially and as a result, we expect the adjusted EBITDA margins in the second quarter to increase 150 to 200 basis points from the first quarter. Margins should then improve 200 to 300 basis points per quarter through the second half of 2019 as cost improvements initiatives flow through. As Bill noted, we remain committed to the full-year guidance to provide on our last earnings call.","In summary, Q1 performance reflects a strong underlying health and shows the contribution from revenue management and improved volume trends. We continue to see good results from the efforts to extend in the high-growth markets in our data center platform in Adjacent Businesses are shelling encouraging progress as the gain greater scale. We're confident that the actions we're implementing to improve margins allow us to achieve our long-term targets.","Then, operator, we'll move to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Yes. Just on adjusted SG&A as a percent of revenue for the quarter, it was, as you acknowledge, elevated at 25.5%. I'm just wondering how much is attributable to labor? Or what are other drivers of that increase?","William Meaney","No. I mean the majority of increase is - you get a few things going on. First of all, the increase year-over-year from a dollar basis, we've - with Acquisition of EvoSwitch and then IO late in January last year, you're getting some increase in overall, overhead cost because of that. And then you're also getting increase in operations team, which we operate in cost of that team as well as some consulting cost. And those are the 2 biggest drivers. And so when you think about the global operations team as we stood that out, you've got cost in the first quarter and continued in the first half of the year and those will switch into benefits as they more than pay for themselves in the second half of the year. And as we sort of think about it as we said these things up, right? We're taking cost earlier this year as we're really trying to get them to pay for themselves within the year. We are going to go ahead and just sort of given the operational issues accelerates some things that we would have spread up later in the year and put those forward into Q2.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Great. And then just following up on the MakeSpace acquisition. I just wonder how you view that business setting in it at Iron Mountain? How are you integrating it? Will that business we with Iron Mountain trucks? And how the margin compare to traditional's - your traditional storage business?","William Meaney","No, it's a good question, Sheila. So first of all, we're a significant by minority shareholders at JV. So it set up as a JV rather than integrating MakeSpace. So for us, the perfect relationship. So besides being a large minority shareholder in the company, we're also the exclusive provider of the back and services. In the back and services means that our trucks and drivers picking up the material or delivering the material in our facilities soaring. So we're the exclusive service provider to that joint venture, which effectively gets us in the consumer space with a B2B relationships. So we're still a business-to-business with MakeSpace, and we get the benefit of their understanding of the consumer space. And they've proven themselves, not only to have a very effective brand and marketing approach, but very efficient acquisition cost of customers. So we're pretty excited about the relationship. From their spit standpoint, is that we bring the logistics and handling expertise that quite frankly both them and other consumer self-storage companies have struggled with and this particular area. So we're able to leverage what really as our core strength. And also use our real estate footprint. So they're pretty excited because we're able to help them expand much quicker across the United States because we're already in the United States. So we think it's actually very synergistic relationship that we've been able to carve out with them.","Sheila McGrath","So the venture will store the - in your facilities?","William Meaney","Yes, exactly. Exactly.","Operator","The next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg.","Nathan Crossett","I saw on the presentation that you're seeking JV partners for the Frankfurt DC project. So I was wondering if you could maybe provide some color on what that might look like? And maybe the types of providers you are looking to maybe partner with? And then just a follow on to that, just curious to hear your overall comments on the European data center market as we're heading that demand is pretty strong, especially in the flap areas?","William Meaney","So Nathan, select me start with the last question and then Stuart was talking about how we think about joint ventures generally and specifically why we called it up that we're considering up for Frankfort. So you're right. I mean we remain bullish on the European data center markets. So we're really pleased in terms we've been able to establish a strong footprint, both in London in the floor space with the acquisition and out with the EvoSwitch in Amsterdam. So we're really happy with that. And now with the land in Frankfurt. So as you know, Franklin, London, Amsterdam and Paris are considered top markets in Europe and the growth there continues to see - we see robust growth across both the wholesale market as well as the retail market. So we're - so far we're really pleased in terms of what's happening here. But I think they probably came into their own a little bit behind where the U.S. outsourcing. But they're definitely picking up pace at a really good rate.","Stuart Brown","Yes, on the Frankfurt joint venture that we're evaluating, yes, it's lots of capital out there looking to be put to work in the data center business and the type of structure would be looking at would be something fairly typical for other REIT. Why Frankfurt? Is really because if you look at some of the development we've got in the other markets in Amsterdam and Arizona, there's frankly, would be probably too many conflicts with our existing. So Frankfurt is easy to carve out into its own joint venture, wouldn't be any conflicts with the existing Iron Mountain properties. And we're in the early phases of that. And we will evaluate demands are. So we're looking for long-term partner who can invest with us in Frankfurt and then we wanted to consider other markets outside of that will be open to that as well.","Nathan Crossett","Okay. That's helpful. And is there any preference is there any public or private. There the public eye on the best of potential JV? Or can you give any...","William Meaney","It's most likely a long-term pension-type money that's looking for these type of investments, it could be some of these are going to be in this for long time as we build it out.","Nathan Crossett","Okay. That's helpful. And then just another question on Google partnership. kind of how should we think about that in terms of bottom line numbers? And I know it's very early days, but do you expect us to want to kind of having a meaningful impact on AFFO or any color would be helpful on that.","William Meaney","We'll give you more guidance as we get into for sure in for our 2020. This year, what we've - our expectations and your expectation should be that any revenue will we get will be a watch with the cost standing this out. I think I might've mentioned in the last call is that we've done over a dozen proof of concepts across the range of industries, and we're really excited about the results that we're getting from that. So what we see this as a natural add-on to our digital standing business. So globally, we do about $200 million worth of just, what I would call, digital scanning or taking physical documents and turning it into digital formats. And that grows at high single, low double-digit organic growth. We see this as opportunity to actually accelerate that growth because people are looking to get more benefit when they actually digitize historically physical documents. So it's early days, but we really think the way we think about this is accelerating that high single-digit, low double-digit growth that we have in our digitalization business as we're - and this is the tool give more encourage them to do that.","Operator","The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Looking at your developed markets appears new sales pig down from 1.6% last quarter to 1.5% this quarter and New volume from existing customers also take down from 3.8% to 3.7% while discretion picked up from 4.6% to 4.9%. Can you talk about where or when you might expect from of these trends to stabilize? And what initiatives you have to potentially drive an inflection?","William Meaney","Yes, I think, George, what I would say is and it depends on which - whether you're looking quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year and if you're looking at just North America or North America and Europe. So some of the movements that you're highlighting vice important our whatever call within the range of what we expect. So we don't see any major change obviously, the result that we're reporting this quarter are better than they were reporting in the last 2 quarters. But we don't see it as a major change. So if you kind of look at overall actually, we said that destructions would be at 4.5% to 5% range. And actually in total is - yes, I'm looking at total volume now is we're at 4.5%. Any given market can kind of trench those movements.","So I think you're kind of picking it at a specific market. You see overall actually destructions have gone down this quarter. If you look at the total business. But we still think whilst this nice to see 4.5% versus 5%, we still think, we're operating within that range. So I think we should see it's not going to be any big inflection point either up or down in the business. I think this is pretty much steady as she goes and where we will see it change is as we continue to make Emerging Markets a bigger part of the mix then of course globally, that will have an improvement. So the thing if you think, what do we really see has the being that will make a long-term impact? It is now that you've started to reporting the volumes of these other areas that we've been including, if you will, on our occupancy that we've never shown you how much volume it actually drives.","So if you look at specifically the non-records business over the last two years, over the last two years on a non-records business so that would be the art entertainment services and now consumer. Well, in consumer we've been doing on her own for a number of years now or a number of quarters. As you'll see that those then amongst themselves generated about 5 million cubic - increased cubic over the last two years, which is about 20% of the growth of cubic feet that we've seen as a company. So small in terms of, if you look at how much it is in terms of total, but in terms of the growth, if you're looking for inflection points, those are the things that you will see changing over time. But overall, in terms of the record business, you could see it as steady as you go with a little bit of improvement consolidated has emerging markets continues to become a bigger part of the mix.","George Tong","Very helpful. Your most recent 2020 targets include revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.75 billion and EBIT target to $1.86 billion to $1.76 billion. And Jude discuss the progress in reaching those targets? And where you see EBITDA margins heading, especially given the margins are relatively FX neutral?","Stuart Brown","George, you're talking about sort of as we're sort of looking start off margin progression for the year where we expect margins to go. If you look at - for the - through first quarter, we talked about we had some unusual expenses, right? And so the guidance comments that I gave implies about 650 basis point margin improvement in Q1 to Q4, right? So I'll give you a pretty good exit rate from '19. And then if you think about in dollar terms, right? We're a little over $1 billion quarter of revenue. So that implies EBITDA dollars going up from Q1 to Q4 about $70 million. And if you think about one of the big buckets that drive that, but you normally get both revenue management as well as cost improvement initiatives as we move for the year. That will continue to be with the biggest buckets for that. You've always get the correct affections that they're taking to talk about year in this call. You will get lower SG&A as we talked about and you get the benefit from the global team which really switches before from cost of benefits from Q1 to Q4. And that's around procurements service labor and some of the other areas. So that will benefit both North America as well as the international businesses. So I think the sets us up pretty well going into 2020 for the [indiscernible] we've provided longer term.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","It's Andrew. The organic revenue growth was 1.9% in the first quarter and the guide for the year is still 2.0% to 2.5%. What gives management confidence that some acceleration into organic revenue growth as I imagine moves through the year?","Stuart Brown","Andrew, this is Stuart. I mean if you - the storage is obviously from a gross profit and cash flow is the biggest driver and that's right on track. As you talk about the service revenue in Q1 and Q2, the growth will be a little bit slower than we had in the year-ago, particularly in Q2 actually going foreshadow that as recycled paper prices come down. But some of the other service areas in terms of project revenue pipeline including some of the information governance and some of the other areas will drive the service growth in the second half. So we remain quite confident in the service - implied service growth and what that means for the total.","William Meaney","And if you think about it, Andrew, is that we actually have built our confidence. Our confidence is even stronger about revenue than it was a month or 3 months ago just because we were quarter into the year. And we can see the pipeline going forward, so we feel pretty good about where we are in the revenue front.","Operator","The next question is from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","Stuart, I was just wondering the dollar strengthens here a little bit since you guys last reported, how does that fact factors into your guidance?","Stuart Brown","Yes, I mean it's our guidance range and when built them this year, we sort of changed our process on that a little bit, so we have wider EBITDA guidance this year than we used - sort of had historically over the past few years. It basically goes ahead in our dollar guidance before our guidance was around through constant currency. So I think if you look at the EBITDA impact in the first quarter of currency was actually the broad EBITDA year-over-year down a bit $10 million, that was built into our guidance. And I think where FX is today, you basically right towards the middle of guidance and the upper and lower end of the range taking into account any potential movement.","Andrew Wittmann","So last quarter, you guys talked about for the year I think you saw it was going to be a $20 million to $25 million EBITDA headwind on the [indiscernible] line, so you think it's $15 million-or-so - $10 million or $15 million for the balance of the year. Is that another way of saying the same thing?","Stuart Brown","Yes, that's about right.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. Just on - just noticed on your kind of on your CAD schedule that there's an incremental $50 million that but I think was called out here from Frankfort and then that was offset by $50 million of capital recycling. Just given that, I wanted to get some sense of confidence around have those assets that you're going to be recycling that identified on the market whether that still kind of in the brick to figure out how that's going to translate?","William Meaney","Yes. We've got a package of that $25 million of real estate in North America, I would call it, sort of more secondary markets, Midwest markets in the market right now and seem good demands on that. And so we've got additional package up and ready to go have the first one goes. So then the bigger question around that will be recycling more real estate as the question around doesn't make sense for us to investment partnership for the Frankfurt line of purchase. Now leasing gone into some questions around time and with that. But we feel there's a lot of demand out there for JV with us, just going to make the terms make sense.","Andrew Wittmann","So is it fair to assume that $50 million number that you have in there is - that's if you were to do by all by yourself now without a partner. So that could actually not be $50 million, if you found somebody?","William Meaney","Yes, correct, correct. If we found somebody, we [indiscernible] land in it and can get capital back from that partner right away.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Funk of Bank of America.","Michael Funk","I have two quick ones, if you wouldn't mind. So looking at Slide 17 and you showed the $380 million of incremental capital needed for discretionary investments beyond the capital recycling and the JV than other sources of capital. I'd love to get your commentary on how you are thinking about maybe your comfort level with where your leverage is right now? And then you haven't issued equity in a year and half, so I want your commentary about potentially accessing the equity capital markets? I think it was last around 37 so not too far from what your equity is now. And then second question, I think last quarter you talked about revenue manager program, may be being less of a headwind in the second half - sorry, tailwind in the second half of 2019. If I'm correct about that, may be just comment on how that factors into your margin progression commentary?","William Meaney","Okay. So let me - I'll start with the revenue management and also just give you a snapshot in terms of how we think about debt overall. And then Stuart will talk a little bit more about what he's seeing in the debt markets and how well we're able to access those. So on the revenue management side, actually it's a little bit back to front from what you intimated is. Generally, in the first quarter, we see around 15% of the revenue management benefit come through in the first quarter, just the way the pricing reviews are done in the contract renewals are done with customers as we go built through the year and then it builds towards the end of the year. So well more than half comes in the last half of the year and Q2 is somewhere between Q1 and the second half of the year, if you will. So the first quarter is only about around 15% of the benefit from pricing. And we see that. This year we expect to do a little bit better than we did last year and pricing because we're starting to get some reasonable progress in the international markets, which only start coming online last year.","So we feel good about fear we are with that given the first quarter performance in revenue management. Overall, just to give you a snapshot on the debt and then Stuart can give you a little bit more specifics around the access to the debt markets right now. Is generally we're not uncomfortable in terms of where we stayed with the debt we know very price. So we actually price usually at the upper end of investment grade, buys were not an investment grade data sure. So we feel relatively good about that. If you look at us our leverage relative to say that to reap peers, we're again pretty much spot on to where those folks are. And I think we have a slide, Slide 10 kind of demonstrates that in the debt. So the issue for us and the reason why we say we want to continue to de-lever over time is our covenants are roughly 6.5, and we would like 1.5 to 2 turns over time daylight between wherever our covenants are and where our leverage states. Just to give more dry powder for opportunistic events that may present themselves. So we don't feel like we are in a rush to deliver because the only thing we will deliver is to create more opportunistically.","So you wouldn't do anything just to de-lever for that. And we - and given the cash generation of our business is, we feel really comfortable that we continue to grow the dividend and de-lever over time. Now in terms of equity issuance, is we look at like any investors, we look at the NAV of the company. And we say, does it make sense to actually issue equity or not? And we have an opinion right now that this is not the best time to be doing that given your share price is sitting. So we kind of look at in terms of what's the best investment. And then we also look at the best way to find that. And right now, when you look at equity you have to look at the NAV of your company, but before I headed over to Stuart is it is fair to say that we're in the data center business that we - data center is capital-intensive and growing and building data centers takes a lot of capital and hence the reason why we're looking at a partnership at Frankford. That being said, don't forget the thing that separates us from some of our data center peers is, we have an almost as north of $1.4 billion EBITDA business. And most of that generated in the mature markets in our core business, which generates a lot of cash. So what we like to say is that we have a very large strong payee bank alongside a $100 million-plus EBITDA business growing very quickly of data centers.","So we actually have a natural in-house funding source that not only fuels the growth of the dividend, not only can deleverage slowly over time, not doing massive delivery, but also is a thing that allows us to do this year we guided about $250 million that we're putting into our data center business. So obviously, if we will try to put $250 million and we were $100 million EBITDA business, that would be a strain. But we're fortunate that we have another relationships that comes with that $1.5 billion EBITDA, but we - it is most of that in mature areas that we're able to harvest a fair amount of cash. But I mean, Stuart, you may want to talk about specifically the data - or the debt markets?","Stuart Brown","Yes. Let me go overall just to be - just quickly. As from an debt investor stand point, we get so much credit for the durable cash flow that comes out of the business. So as Bill mentioned, it's right, we price that close to investment grade, even though the rating agency have historically not treatise the same way. We talked about in the last earnings call. We'll actually deliver over time as EBITDA growth, right? Because if you look at for the investments are that need and incremental capital. It is around building out the data center platform. So we've had a great platform, but as we've done the acquisitions, it didn't have a lot of capacity to least out. So we have to build out and developed.","So that's really what's driving the $250 million of the capital needs. And investors understand, I think the rating agency understand that as well. So quite confident as it grows and leases up, the value of the data center platform will only continue to increase. One other thing I'll add to Bill, is that when we're looking at, hey, what's the way to source that? We look at debt. We have an ATM in place again today, if you look at where the ATM is and you look at where the cap rates are an industry really states. We've chosen right now to recycle capital and some of the industry real estate some of the higher invested and if you look at our credit, people who want to do sale lease back transactions love our credit and the rates that you will see on these are really good. So we are going there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Stuart, can you just walk me through again the labor cost in the U.S. You hired additional people in order to not have over time with the existing ones, but the timing didn't work out right. Can you just walk me through that exactly on the ground how that it works?","Stuart Brown","No, I'll give you a little bit more detail here than we normally would. With all great intentions, right would chew seen in the liver markets of North America is more demand, particularly around warehouse workers and drivers. And we took some steps last year wage rates. And with the raise in the wage rates, we were - we had a lot of overtime. So we'll take these rates up that will get offset by lower time and which is sort of a natural thing to assume. When you hire people you also have period of trainings, so your productivity is going to suffer for a little while as you're stacking up. I think what happened is we weren't managing that change very well and actually overstaffed because good news is attrition been done were able to retain people, but we did manage the productivity after the training period. And therefore, ends up with too much overtime.","The month of January is a strong month for sort of - for the bin tips, it's really around sort of drivers people in the field. And so the issue really manifest itself in March when those productivity improvements, that should have been there, didn't show up. So overall, when you look overall in Iron Mountain, our labor rate as a percentage of revenue actually declined. It didn't decline as much as we expected to, and this was sort of a major cause of the issue of the shortfall in trade. Paper prices were actually down on the shred business were down a little bit below we expected it to be as well. You get paper prices in the quarter really move down and March was little bit lower. So that was a piece of the overall shred business but majority was sort of labor productivity. The good news is that the course correction as pretty quickly.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then this is completely different though it than Western Europe? Or using the same kind of labor issues over there as margin was down as well over there with 230 basis points?","William Meaney","Yes, it's similar - the different issue the labor there was impacted greatly we had some good project revenue in Q1. Do you have a good pipeline and the project revenue in Q1 was down and we did manage some of contingent labor as well we should have on the server-side around projects. We lost some productivity and that as well. Again, correctable add regrettable as well, but you were taking actions on it.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. That's good color. And then is there a way - first of all, I mean there's discussion on paper prices and EBITDA and it does seem to catch investors by surprise. Can you just give us the number or in terms of percentage of EBITDA that paper is? Or what it is this quarter versus last quarter a year ago quarter? So that we could kind of gauge and not be surprised by stuff like that?","William Meaney","Yes, I think the paper prices are volatile. If you take a step back in the overall shred business, revenue was around $440 million, 4450 million a year. And about a third of that revenue comes from the sale of paper for recycling. And so that what's give you a majority of that close through. It doesn't flow through at 100%, but it flows through at probably 90% in the EBITDA. So that sort of where you get the volatility. If you take those numbers the paper prices can be really worried to last year. Again, it peaked in the second quarter last year. So Q1 we are actually stable Q1 was actually a tailwind for us this year. You too will be a headwind for us. So that gives you an idea what the magnitude of the scope of the businesses.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. That' sounds good. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just - and the acquisitions of customer relationship, is there a way for us to triangulate is to how much volume you contribute through those, like $33 million or $34 million this quarter? How much volume does that add to your organic volume when you make those? Is there like a per million dollars we add x amount of volume? Or how can we think about them more broadly?","Stuart Brown","In that number also includes things like service acquisitions, which could be in shred or other businesses. If you look at sort of historically and how we sort of look the normal pace of the businesses we typically pick up on an annualized basis about 3 million to 4 million cubic week per year through customer acquisitions, through acquisitions and customer contracts. And we've always included that organically because really the alternative is to go out and pay commissions to somebody else, which really, if it wasn't the commission lines, it sort of wouldn't be a question about it. We're not buying assets, we're not buying businesses. It's really acquiring customer contacts. And so that is sort of the other side of the coin.","Operator","The next question is from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","I wanted to go back to expense topic again. It sounds like the March cost in the shred and the SG&A line, but you also saw a large increase in storage operating expenses, I think was up 7% year-over-year including a 24% increase in labor there as well. Are you seeing course pressures across the entire business or was there anything one-time in that in that line?","Stuart Brown","No, the other piece of the story sides have the change in the lease accounting year-over-year. So that impact to that as well. Nothing to call out. There's no sort of global labor pressures that we sort of see standing out that we expect.","William Meaney","Yes, no, if you kind of take, Karin, one more piece of color on that. If you take the two piece so we talked about $10 million that was unexpecting, these thing happens from time to time in the business. $10 million on a $1.5 billion or approaching $1.5 billion EBITDA business, this is not these things generally we catch them early in the quarter, we can manage them and these things happen from time to time. This one was just then you start getting into March, there's not a lot of time to recover. So that kind of one thing. The other product in terms of the increased SG&A, as Stuart said before, was actually planned is. Because if you want to get continuous improvement to pay for itself in year, we have to execute in the first quarter. So when the ramp up programs like this you generally see a frontload of the cost in Q1 into a certain degree of Q2. So that benefits. Now the good result is that we set this group up. And because they've actually week in our expectation when the set them up okay, let's go even harder going into Q2 on some of the programs that they keyed up in Q1, which means that at the end, you're not able to make the $10 million, which is as you say, is not the hardest thing and given the size of the business in 9 months to run. But it means stronger EBITDA margin exit rate when we go into 2020.","Stuart Brown","Okay. One of the things I forgot to mention on the other storage as well, you do have the impact year-over-year on the EvoSwitch acquisition, which has got from a higher facilities cost, obviously, and sort of the core part of the business as a percentage of revenue. So that is one of the drivers just the gross margin storage.","Karin Ford","Got it. That actually your answers segues into my next question, which - it just seems like kind of a quick turnaround on the expense side, given the complexity of the initiatives you laid out. What gives you confidence that you can achieve a 650 basis points margin swing, basically in three quarters?","William Meaney","It's actually not that - while I appreciate - I'm going to tell my board you have a very complex job I make sure I use that. Right now, it's not a complex as you see. The thing that is - first of all, the labor issue in shred, it is - it takes management. But the bottom line is if you are replacing over time with full time you have to manage the overtime people don't know where it's really been over time we didn't do that properly. There was a learning lesson for us because we don't do that that often. We actually run our place pretty efficiently, but many times overhead - overtime so edifies that we have to do this large hiring and then manage that out. So that we're able to reverse that very, very quickly. So now that we've been able to identify and put people on it. I think in terms of the SG&A, first of all, and that area is, as Stuart said, we actually brought consultants in to help build out the upstream, the global upstream and into initiate a number of those projects. So those are - that was planned cost to come in and come out. So that's actually already done and pretty straightforward.","And then, the other area and some of the areas in terms of the get to what our global ops team have identified in Q1 and start initiating some of it was just global best practices on transportation. So we actually in any given day around the world the good thing about having transportation being a heavily demanded area is we have open racks or open positions in our pretty much globally and our transportation. And we're able to manage that cost out pretty quickly by just not feeling or canceling some of those openings as we bring productivity into our fleet. So that's one area. And the other area, which I don't think we did mention in our remarks, a big chunk of our improvement issue believe it or not coming is from procurement. We've done a pretty good job in speeding agility a few years ago and procurement. That was primarily focused in North America. And now we've actually given, with JB coming in as the Chief Operating Officer, we've expanded his - including procurement, and procurement now's a global exercise. So fairly straight, we're still, I would say, at the low hanging fruit stage. I'm sure it will get complex. I'll make sure I'll tell my Board that in the years to come. But right now, it's fairly straightforward.","Karin Ford","Great. And I'll just finish up with data center question. Can you give us an estimate of what you think the mark-to-market is going to on the 68% data center rent you have expiring over the next three years?","William Meaney","I think, overall, again, we - from a GAAP standpoint, right, we adjusted through the acquisition on IO and EvoSwitch, basically two market on GAAP basis. And we did both of those acquisitions, we found them pretty close to the markets. So we don't expect a big mark-to-market on the turnover.","Stuart Brown","Yes, I think the good about, Karin, is we're relatively new in the data center space. So it was a lot of - I think the question behind your question, there was a lot of price compression I think over the last 3 or 4 years. Our contract is still relatively new other than the mark-to-market during the acquisition. And when we look at our exposure in the hyperscale is still relatively small. We think that's an important segment and we continue to grow and look for ways to expand in that business. But our models are based where the prices have adjusted to now rather than us trying to hang on to business that was priced at higher historical pressures. We think pressing now it's pretty much leveling out to where the clearing price is based on the expected returns that underlie our sales should expect.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin McVeigh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","Billing or Stuart, is there anything in terms of revenue? I mean the organic growth came in at 1.9%. I think if you have it right, it's the easiest comp of the year and then the comps come and get more difficult. Is there anything that kind of comes in and helps that grow over factor. How should we think about that over the balance of 2019?","Stuart Brown","Kevin, this is Stuart. From a growth perspective year-over-year, I mean you get a little bit of lumpiness. But again, on the 700 million cubic week of volume, right, that we're storing for the customers that think paying every month. On the margin in the numbers you talked about on seasonal stand point of view are really small. So as I think Bill mentioned little bit better than we expected, both from destruction as well as in new sales from existing - new customers. And we've got to feel good about the problem that we have for the year. And so we're pretty much right along with her outlook.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And to your point to kind of have a wider range given the FX. At this point do you plan on become - would you think you're coming with the lower end of the range or the higher rent based on where we are in quarter into it?","Stuart Brown","I think the Rangers upper hand or both FX dependent, and I'll leave it at that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].

And welcome to the Iron Mountain Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the conference over to Faten Freiha, Director of Investor Relations.","Faten Freiha - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Hula, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This morning, I'll be filling in for Melissa Marsden, who couldn't be here with us today, due to a family matter. We'll begin the call with Bill Meaney, our CEO, who'll discuss highlights for the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results.","After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we've done for the last few quarters, we've posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations\/Financial Information.","Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 and 2016 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Faten, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be report a solid third quarter results that were at the upper end of our profit expectations and underscore the durability of our core business. It's based upon this continued demonstration of the growth and durability of our business that our Board of Directors has resumed our growth in dividends and has pull forward the dividend increase by declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.485 per share.","I suspect most of you on the call today, either attended in person or listened to the webcast of our Investor Day about two weeks ago. Therefore, I won't go into a long discussion of our strategy, goals or longer-term expectations, as I believe time would be better spent on Q&A. That's said, I would like to briefly reiterate a few main points from our event and relate how our Q3 results fit within that framework.","For those, who haven't heard the live event or listened to the replay, we laid out our vision for the year 2020, given that we are rapidly approaching the end of the three-year strategic plan that we introduced at our Investor Day in the beginning of 2014.","More specifically, we described our past performance and go-forward vision for our three strategic pillars, developed markets, emerging markets and adjacent businesses. In developed markets, our strategic plan over the last two years has turned around these relatively flat internal growth markets and driven more than 7 million cubic feet of net new records, all prior to acquisition.","In emerging markets, our sales expanded from representing 10% of total revenue in 2013 to 14.3% of total revenue by the end of Q3 on a constant dollar basis. These markets are growing 10% to 15% per year before acquisitions and our goal to reach 20% of total volume from these markets by 2020 is within our grasp. Roughly 18% of the 20% goal will be reached by internal growth alone.","In adjacent businesses, we expect revenue to represent 5% of our total worldwide revenue in 2020, up from just 2% today. Currently, our adjacent businesses are comprised of our datacenter business and our recently announced acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts Storage, the leading arts storage business in the U.S.","This is a natural extension of our film and sound business. Crozier comes with about a 0.5 million square feet of owned real estate and achieves about 10% sales growth per year before acquisitions. We anticipate closing this deal in December.","This all adds up to a shift in mix with 25% of our revenue coming from faster growth markets and businesses by 2020. That's up from 15% today with a majority of increase coming from internal growth. The expected impact from this shift is that by 2020 annual internal profit will grow by roughly 5% or 7% with acquisitions versus 2% and 4%, respectively, today.","We also enhanced our Transformation program to deliver a total of $125 million of overhead savings, up from the $100 million we announced this summer. You can see from the bridging schedules in the supplemental that we recorded $9 million of charges in Q3 related to this program.","We expect to realize partial year benefit of the first $50 million in savings in the fourth quarter, offsetting this charge. The full $50 million annualized benefit will flow through in 2016 and beyond. And our next set of actions to be taken in early 2016 will represent another $50 million of annualized savings in 2017.","So we're getting more from our efforts in this program and we're getting it faster than originally anticipated. We outlined our plans to continue to increase the percentage of owned real estate over time through our programs, which deliver improved operating economics with the consolidation of facilities.","Lastly, we demonstrated future cash generation on a run rate basis to support growth in dividends and investment, both on a standalone basis and including Recall. On a standalone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation Program, will at a minimum allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018, whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018 and reduces leverage by 0.7 turns. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall.","Now, turning to Q3 financial and operating highlights, total revenue for the quarter grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.2%. The impact from foreign currency on total revenues was roughly 7%, reflecting the continued strong appreciation of the dollar against several of our major functional currencies.","Moreover, we should note that we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity this quarter, as we deferred transactions to assess how they may be affected by the Recall acquisition. Having now fully assessed the benefit of the Recall acquisition, we have resumed M&A activity with an appropriately adjusted focus to account for Recall's footprint.","This quarter, we continued to see good internal growth with storage rental up 2.8% for both the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range.","Looking at volume in Records Management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.7% net growth. Globally, we retained 98% of all customers. This is in line with our second quarter and a 20% improvement from the customer turnover we experienced just two years ago. We continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded, some 30 million cubic feet from our existing customers year after year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business.","The durability of our business is demonstrated by solid growth in bookings we are seeing across major verticals. In addition, we encouraged by year-to-date low double-digit increase in the midmarket customer bookings, as we continue to increase our focus on these small to midsize enterprises where our market share of the total market is roughly 10%.","We are pleased to report solid improvement in our service gross margins as a result of numerous initiatives. Q3 total service gross margin was 28.5%. However, when normalizing for the reclassification between storage and service, Q3 total service gross margins were approximately 26.8% and we are well on track to achieve our expected end-of-year run rate of between 27% and 27.5%.","Now, let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. With the benefit from a number of months of detailed and joint integration planning with our Recall counterparts, we remain comfortable with the estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved in 2017.","As we've noted in the past, there is potential upside to these figures as we work through real estate consolidation opportunities. We remain on track from a regulatory standpoint and we continue to target a close in early 2016.","As I've said previously, our business is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance even in the most volatile times.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with this quarter's strong operating performance and the momentum we continue to see in our business. Our results continue to underscore the strength and durability of our storage rental business and the incremental returns we're generating from our investments.","Similar to Bill, my remarks this morning will be brief. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segments, and an update on cost related to the potential Recall transaction. Finally, I will touch briefly on our outlook for 2015 and 2016.","Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, total reported revenues for the quarter was $747 million compared with $783 million in the prior year. This decline reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 6.6% or $50 million year-over-year. Excluding FX, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $2.26 billion compared with $2.34 billion in 2014. And again, excluding FX, also grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis.","Total revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% for the quarter and year-to-date. This was offset by modest service revenue declines of roughly 1.3% for the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue is partially driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the UK and Australia.","Consistent with prior quarters, we're providing bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These schedules are on pages 20 through 22 of the supplemental.","In addition, this quarter, we're providing a bridging schedule on page 23 to explain the change at our total service gross margin. In this schedule, we have normalized for the accounting adjustment that Bill referenced. And our projected year-end run rate of 27% to 27.5% is consistent with that normalized basis.","Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $228 million compared to $235 million in 2014. Excluding FX, adjusted OIBDA was up 2.3%. Our adjusted OIBDA for Q3 2015 included $9 million of charges related to our Transformation program. Excluding these costs, adjusted OIBDA would have been $237 million or grown 6.5% on a normalized constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis.","For the fourth quarter, we expect to incur very little in charges related to the Transformation product initiative. Please note that our savings outlook for Transformation remain consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the third quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by a 9% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014, as well as the restructuring charges related to Transformation. Excluding the increase in share count and the Transformation costs, normalized adjusted EPS grew by 8.7% for the quarter.","Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 16.5% compared with 16.3% for the prior quarter and 13.9% in Q2. The sequential increase in our structural tax rate was driven by the expenses related to the Recall acquisition and debt refinancing costs, which lowered our QRS pre-tax income. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% in the short-term. Our blended rate, following the close of the potential Recall acquisition, will be closer to 20%, as we noted when we announced the deal.","Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.55 for the quarter and $1.53 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $137 million for the quarter and $395 million year-to-date.","Let's turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue showed a decline of 0.3% for the third quarter and is flat year-to-date. North American RIM internal storage rental growth can vary on a quarterly basis and is often impacted by the timing of large contract renegotiations.","For the last eight quarters, it has varied from 0.9% to minus 0.4%. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to continued decrease in retrieve\/refile activity levels and the timing of non-recurring imaging projects that were in the year-ago period. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 40% for the quarter and year-to-date.","North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of more than 5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. However, internal service declined by 4.9% for the quarter and 4.1% year-to-date, as we continue to see declines in tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the third quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained stronger at 51.6% compared with 50.8% in Q2.","The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 1.4% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 2.8% year-to-date. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in non-recurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong in Western Europe at 31.2%.","The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 12.3% for the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens and low 20%s range in the short-term, as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets.","Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're making good progress with the regulatory process and we anticipate closing the deal early in 2016. To prepare for closing, this quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of professional and advisory fees, including cost to prepare for Recall's REIT reconversion. We expect about $25 million to $30 million of additional Recall cost in the fourth quarter.","Please note that these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations, as they are one-time in nature. Importantly, these costs were included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.","As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 and 2016 remains consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this month at our Investor Day. But one exception to that is that we tightened our expected real estate investment range and lowered it by roughly $30 million at the midpoint relative to the projections provided at our Investor Day due to the focus on in timing of our real estate consolidation program.","Given FX fluctuations and to provide better visibility of the underlying performance of our business, we're providing constant dollar guidance figures for 2016 and our plan is to continue that practice.","Please note that our current 2016 guidance is based on 2015 constant dollar budget rates, which was set in January 2015. When we'll report full year 2015 results in February, we will provide an updated 2016 guidance based on 2016 constant dollar budget rates, which will be set in early January 2016.","We've got the question from some of you on R$ guidance for 2016. Assuming constant September 30 FX rates, our exit FX impact for the quarter on total revenue, where approximately 40% of it denominated in non-U.S. dollars, is roughly 3.5%.","Again, holding that constant for 2016, it implies a 3.5% FX impact on revenues, which translates into roughly $120 million impact for the full year. Beyond the dividend increase that Bill mentioned for the upcoming quarter, we laid out at our Investor Day minimum projected dividends per share guidance through 2018 on a standalone basis and the combined basis with Recall. Please refer to the presentation and webcast for more details.","Late in September, we raised $1 billion of debt at 6%, enabling us to pay off some of our very high interest legacy debt and lowering our average interest costs. At the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Note that this figure is prior to the October 2015 redemption of our outstanding 6.75% euro notes and 7.75% U.S. notes and 8.375% U.S. notes. Following the redemption, liquidity will be approximately $900 million. Lastly, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7 times as expected.","Turning now to page 34 for supplemental where we highlight our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, the total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidated-related spend.","As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns on our growth racking and building development projects. So far this year, our investment in M&A and real estate investment activity has been lower than typical as we prepare for the potential Recall acquisition. We are focusing future plans on the synergy potential fuelled by our real estate consolidation between the companies.","Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter and we're pleased with the progress we have made so far in advancing our Transformation program and stabilizing service gross margins. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015 as well as our long-term objectives.","Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments.","And with that, operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Good morning.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you for the details. I wanted to ask about the relationship between some of the organic volumes and the organic revenue growth rates in your two mature markets. It looks like in North American RIM organic revenue was minus 1.2%. The volumes were about flat; kind of a similar relationship in Western Europe where revenue was down 3.3%, but \u2013 I'm sorry, organic volumes were up over 3%, but total revenue was just on the positive side of flat. So, is there a pricing dynamic that's in there or is there something else going on? If you can give us some color around that relationship it would be helpful.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the \u2013 Andy, I think there's two aspects. One is the \u2013 one set of data, if we look at the price changes measured in revenue in terms of constant dollar storage, it's quarter-on-quarter. And when we look at volume, it's trailing 12 months. So, you can't quite put the two of them together. But if you kind of look at North America, North America is achieving similar types net volume growth organically, or before acquisitions, as we were last year. So, it's actually up in terms of volume.","We've had some pricing adjustments this quarter due to some renewals, which I think we talked about a little bit on Investor Day. It's not unusual during certain times of the year. And if you go back over, say, the last two to three years, you'll see that we have maybe two, three, four quarters of positive internal storage revenue growth in North America and then it's punctuated by one or two quarters generally of negative, which is usually associated when we're doing renewals. But you can't \u2013 because one set of data, in terms if we look at the revenue side, is quarter-by-quarter, you can't link that to volume, which is just on trailing 12 months. I don't know, Rod, if you want to add anything to that.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think that's right. It's difficult to do the comparisons on a true like-for-like basis, as you said.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That makes total sense.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The only thing I would add, Andy, from a modeling standpoint, it's still what we've been saying consistently is that, so the volume \u2013 you can back out the volume increases that we're getting both in North America and in Europe. So that's easy. And then, in terms of the revenue increase, we still are achieving somewhere between 0.5% to 1% annual price increase in those markets. So, we're a little bit \u2013 we're starting to move a little bit more towards the upper part in that range through some of the technology we've added, but it's basically in that 0.5% to 1% on top of the volume growth that we're getting.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, Rod, with \u2013 after doing the October notes refi on to the line, the coordinates are a little bit tighter. Are you looking at tapping the unsecured market to term some of that debt out or is there complications with the pending Recall deal that we have to factor into your calculus here? Some of your thoughts on the capital structure would be helpful, I think.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I think we're happy with the capital structure that we have at the moment, particularly having paid off the very high interest notes that we had. Effectively, what we'd like to do is hold what we have, see what happens through the Recall deal, which is to say we anticipate it to close in early Q1, but we're still working through the regulatory process there. It gives us some capital to assist with that on closure, if you like. But \u2013 so we're going to kind of hold what we've got and see how we get on with Recall.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks. Hey, nice job. Asking about Recall, but just one more time, because it'd probably be the last time before it closes. Bill, I know you're working through the regulatory, is it \u2013 are there any kind of goal post or anything that we should look out or is it just something you'll update once you're through the regulatory process? Because obviously something came out of the UK last week from the authorities, it looks like relatively benign. But is there any kind of disclosures you just think we should focus on as we get closer to the close process?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Kevin. I appreciate the question. I think if you can imagine that the regulators like these discussions to be kept confidential as we go through them. I think the \u2013 but I mean just to give you guidance, I think it's pretty much what we said at Investor Day is, we're engaged with the four regulatory authorities that have shown interest in the transaction, which is the U.S., Canada, the UK, as you mentioned, and Australia. We feel that we're well engaged with those authorities, so on track for a Q1 close and the discussions are ongoing. But where we sit today, we feel good that it's in line with our expectations when we set out on the course. So, nothing has changed. I mean, generally, these things take six months to 12 months, when you go through a regulatory process in the United States, for instance, but we continue to guide at the lower end of that range because we feel good where we stand.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then, as you think about the progression, kind of the volume growth, I've always thought that you'd start to see destructions and permanent removal start to kind of trail off, and then new volume growth, I mean, just the customers kicks up. Does that kind of ratio still hold through as we're coming out of this kind of cycle in terms of things we look forward, as a volume growth starts to reaccelerate here?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, look, you're right. I mean you've watched this for a long time. There's ebbs and flows. I'm not sure you can always do the cause and effect between perm-outs (29:07) and destructions, but \u2013 and customer withdrawals, but I think the \u2013 there is ebb and flow between the two. And the other thing I should point out is the new sales growth is, it's part art and part science, because some of that new sales growth comes from existing customers. And that split between new sales growth and what comes from \"existing customers\" is much to do in terms of the way we compensate our sales force.","In other words, if they get something \u2013 if they get some growth out of an existing customer, but we deemed it as a new area or new location or new department, then we call that a new sale. So I think there is some ebb and flow between the two. And as you know, if we look at the heavily regulated industries, which we have a \u2013 which is a big part of our business, is a lot of that's affected by different litigation that's going on around the world. So I think there is some cause and effects, but I wouldn't overplay it. There's a certain amount of randomness to it.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Cool. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.","Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. This is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. Just looking at your updated guidance, it seems like there's a slightly better OIBDA margins at the midpoint versus last quarter. Can you discuss what is making you incrementally more positive on margins?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I'll let Rod answer that. I think just on a high level, there's a couple things. I think one is if you even look over time, we're pretty good at driving productivity out of the business. Because when you start off, what I was saying earlier is that, we get \u2013 currently, in this low inflation environment, we get somewhere between 0.5% to 1% increase in price. Obviously, our labor cost in certain markets goes up faster than that. So, we continually drive productivity through the business. And that's what really drives our OIBDA growth. And then, I think you can expect also when some of the transformation gets fully realized, now that we're through most of the restructuring cost in this quarter, you could expect that that will even pick up a little bit more. But, Rod, you may want to comment further.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, maybe just to build on what you're saying, you're absolutely right in terms of the point that was made. If you look at our guidance \u2013 take the C$ guidance that we updated at Investor Day, in effect what we're saying is that from a revenue point of view, we see ourselves at the middle of the range, and contribution, we see ourselves more towards the higher point of the range. And obviously, therefore the OIBDA margin goes up. Really, what's behind that is the work that we've been doing on efficiencies around service margin and also around the Transformation efforts that we've referenced. Some of that has come through in 2015 faster than we originally anticipated when we set the guidance back in January. And really, that's what's behind the improvement we're seeing.","Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Thanks. And then, can you just discuss which emerging markets are showing the strongest growth and if that growth reflects expansion in those markets or it's increasing volumes?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think on the emerging markets, we're seeing it pretty much across the board, but it depends on the size of the base. So, for instance, I just came back from Eastern Europe and took couple of members of the board along with me so they could see up close what we're doing out there and also see some of the talent we've got. So, Eastern Europe is growing \u2013 continues to grow extremely well so does in Latin America. I mean, the challenge in Latin America, Brazil, which is our largest operation, for instance, is in terms of growth. And if you measure it in Brazilian real, it is strongly double-digit and continues to do well. I mean, the issue, of course, in places like Brazil is the translation of that because the real's been under pressure.","And then Asia, which is a smaller portion of our portfolio, but again has very strong growth rates, whether you look at India, or you look at places like Hong Kong, Singapore and China. The one thing I would point out, though, is that in markets \u2013 even in markets like Brazil, where we've been under pressure from a real standpoint, so when you translate that in U.S. dollars, the growth may be muted slightly, is we've also been able \u2013 in some of these cases like Brazil, been able to borrow locally in real, which has helped to hedge some of that translation. But I would say pretty much across the board. We haven't seen any slowdown in the emerging markets and all the countries typically run in that low double-digit of internal growth before acquisitions.","Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, there. I know there's a couple of questions already on FX, but if it's possible, Rod, could you just give us the mix of currencies, so we could those calculations ourselves, the mix of currencies?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, really, obviously, we deal in quite a number of currencies in terms of what's impacting our numbers. And I think in terms of the short-term impact, the \u2013 where we've seen the hit is being Canadian dollar, Russian ruble, Aussie dollar, the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. So they've been hitting us during Q3. If you were to take a longer term view, so more looking year-on-year, there sort of wider effects coming in from sterling in particular, where obviously also we have quite a significant business.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The only thing I'd like to add to that, Andrew, is that, whilst you've seen the FX headwinds in revenue, you'll note that it gets muted pretty quickly as we start going through the OIBDA and the EPS line. And the \u2013 where we are at a stage is, in some sense the timing is not bad for us because we are using strong U.S. dollars to invest and build out this portfolio, which is still a relatively small portion in terms of the countries where the currency is mostly impacted, which is in the emerging markets. I'm not saying that the other markets aren't a factor. So, if you say 40% of our sales are in foreign currency, but the currencies that are impacted typically are in that, a little less than 15% emerging market area. And those are areas where our OIBDA margins at this point are lower because we're building scale in those markets. So we're taking strong U.S. dollars to build out these markets right now. And their impact \u2013 even with the negative FX impact, the impact on OIBDA in earnings is muted. It's obviously fully affected at the revenue line, but when you see what happens to earnings, it's muted.","So, I agree you need to model it out, but the earnings is not as sensitive as you might think to the FX, whereas you do see the full sensitivity on the revenue line. That's why we feel comfortable about already starting to increase our dividend because we feel that we've got enough momentum in the business that we can continue and start back on our growth trend in terms of dividends.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That sounds natural (36:27). I'm hoping I could ask a second question. Could you, Rod, talk a little bit more about the OIBDA margin of 30.5% in the third quarter? Were there any one-off helps to that margin? And what puts and takes should we keep in mind as we compare the third quarter OIBDA margins to the implied fourth quarter margin in the guide?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, nothing particularly unusual in Q3. Obviously, other than the fact, we actually booked the $9 million restructuring charge, which actually lowered the margin slightly. I think as we look to Q4, again, sitting here today, I'm not seeing anything particularly unusual that should come through. Obviously, we won't have a repeat of the $9 million charge and there would be some benefit from that actually hitting us in Q4 as a result of the slightly lower cost base. But other than that, I think it's pretty much steady as she goes.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm just trying to compare the storage revenue that was in North American RIM that was slightly negative versus the trends that we're seeing in the charts where you have positive volume growth. And the positive volume growth, if you exclude the acquisitions, has been kind of modestly creeping downwards, but you still got positive growth, but we're seeing kind of negative revenue on an organic basis. Can you kind of just explain that?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Shlomo, let me start off and then Rod can add any color that he thinks that I missed out. So I think, first, let's look at the revenue growth. So if you go back, say, to Q4 2013, right, and you just look at the number of quarters, you'll see that North American storage rental revenue growth has gone negative 0.4%, negative 0.3%, plus 0.3%, plus 0.4%, plus 0.9%, plus 0.5%, and then in the last two quarters a negative 0.1% and negative 0.3%.","So you'll see, first of all, which I was referring to earlier, you'll see that moving around and you can kind of get that \u2013 you can back into that through the supplemental. And so, on the revenue side, because as you can appreciate when we renegotiate large enterprise deals that you do get \u2013 in any given quarter, you can get a significant impact in terms of the revenue associated per cube. So there's a disconnect between that volume growth.","Over a long period of time, though \u2013 if you look at the trend over a long period of time, we still see, if you take the revenue growth and if you look on an annualized basis, we're getting between 0.5% and 1% in terms of price per cube growth, then you get those two bits combined and that will give you a good guide in terms of what the internal storage revenue growth is for a particular market.","So, the \u2013 you're right to point out that we continue to drive significant \u2013 I'd say on a percentage basis relatively small percentage growth in North America, but in terms of volume, because of the size of the North American business, as you know, the law of large numbers, we continue to deliver a significant amount of organic cube volume growth in North America. And over a 12-month period, you should think about 0.5% to 1% price growth on top of that cube growth. But any given quarter, depending on where we are in renewal cycle, especially for the large contracts, if you go back over the last, I don't know, eight quarters, nine quarters, 10 quarters, you'll see that movement around where we'll have one or two quarters where it'll be negative, two quarters or three quarters will be positive and it just kind of moves around.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So just when I look at the trends on the volume growth, so if you take the total company and then North America, which probably is having the largest impact, you're seeing just kind of a modest organic trend down over the last four quarters, if you \u2013 I'm excluding acquired volume, because I think that that's appropriate for this. But if you look at it, you're seeing the organic, say, going from 0.6% \u2013 in North America, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.1% and on total you're going 2%, 1.9%, 1.8%, 1.7%, is there \u2013 we had seen kind of a run up, that whole organic number had been going \u2013 trending up from the middle of 2013 through basically 3Q 2014 and then we're starting to see that coming down. Is there any color you can give to that, those numbers moving in that direction?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, look, I think that it's a little bit is what I think Kevin asked earlier in terms of kind of tos-and-fros between customer cycles, there's a bit of that. I think, also, it's fair to say on a percentage basis, it is coming down slightly because, I mean, partly driven by customer activity, but a big part of it is just the large number. So if you look at the constant \u2013 if you look at the volume of cubes coming in, we're still seeing very consistently across the board 30 million cubes coming in on a growth level and, say, 40 million cubes net coming in.","I think the one of the things that we do where you'll see us try to even tap into another market, which we think is quite large, is what we're doing in the mid-market. So I think if you look at where we are on the mid-market side, I think I actually misquoted is we're in kind of low double-digit growth, if we look at year-on-year bookings for new sales across the board. But in the mid-market, year-to-date, we're up over 60% in terms of bookings in the mid-market where we only have 10% market share. So I think there's some things where we can tap into \"another large market\", but I think it is fair to say that if you look at our core, our normal hunting ground, if you will, it's the law of large numbers and there is a limit in terms of how much more we can get from those customers.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's fair. And can you \u2013 Rod, can you just explain that reallocation of margin between the services and the storage business, what is that all about?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was actually to do with our \u2013 predominantly to do with our data center business where we had some costs that were in the service line that we really analyze where (42:53) we thought they should be in the storage line. So that sort of artificially enhanced the service margin in Q3. So we didn't want to give the impression that we were \u2013 the true underlying run rate was 28.5%, which is what we recorded, that is more like 26%, 26.8%. So that \u2013 it was just a reallocation of cost following a more detailed reviewing.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Does that support the REIT structure when those were reallocated like that?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In that case, it has a very, very minor impact, but \u2013 so it doesn't affect our assets as such (43:31) in any meaningful way.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. If I could just squeeze in one more, there's a pretty large range at the end of the year right now, $0.15 on EPS. Is there any reason why it's so large or is there something that you're anticipating some investments that you're still contemplating at this point in time that can move it around?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. And obviously, we are subject to FX volatility, which during Q3 moved against us. Actually, if you look during the first few weeks of October, it's moved slightly back in our favor. So that can swing the numbers around. But in terms of the fundamentals of the business, it's relatively stable.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","There are no questions in queue.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, operator. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. I know it's a busy time for everyone, but just to sum up. We're very pleased the way the quarter came out. It was a very good quarter driven by the strong \u2013 or continued strong operating performance I should say and has delivered profit that set the upper end of our expectations. So we feel really good about the quarter and hence the recommencing of our dividend increases that we declared this morning. So, thank you, everyone, and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.","As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release.","Please note that we have updated the definitions of adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow to exclude certain costs and expenditures related to our 2011 proxy contest, the work of the strategic review Special Committee of our board and our proposed conversion to a REIT.","With that, I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.","C. Richard Reese","Good morning, Stephen and thank you, everybody, and welcome to our call. I'd like to repeat Stephen's comments to those of you who may have suffered through Hurricane Sandy. It was a massive storm up on the East Coast. We have large operations, and quite a large facility footprint in that area. So we know what you all went through. I am happy to report that Iron Mountain did not suffer any significant facility damage and so forth from the hurricane, and we've weathered that storm quite well, given its impact around us and so forth. We are, however, having some operating challenges primarily related to local access. There are places where we still can't get into our facilities on a regular basis. We've been able to inspect and make sure things are fine, but it has mostly to do with control of local access, and I'm sure that will clear itself up in due course. We also, because of the impact on our customers, particularly in Manhattan, would expect to see some noise in our Q4 service revenues. There'll be some impact. It's a little early to quantify, but we don't expect it will impact storage or any of the real fundamentals of our business for the quarter.","So I hope you all are well. We are busy making sure our customers are taken care of and, quite frankly, through our foundation, making sure any of our employees that are impacted are taken care of, and that's a key part of our agenda at the moment.","Let's look back at the quarter. You'll see that we had good operating results, but we've had some noise or we call macro factors in our numbers. We are telling you and we do expect that for the full year, we'll be -- hit our full year targets. We think the business is running quite well, and we'll go through it. I would expect the call, frankly, to be relatively brief today, as we've just had our recent Investor Day. We appreciate the many of you that attended. We had a great turnout, and I think a good conversation, and we appreciate your feedback and your input and, hopefully, we did a good job of communicating to you where we are and where we're headed as a company.","As I said, operating results for the quarter were on target and in line with our expectation. Reported revenues at $748 million were down 2.6% on a reported basis compared to last year, primarily driven by the impacts of lower paper prices and unfavorable FX. Lower recycled paper prices in our shredding business, as well as destroying records from our storage business reduced our overall revenue growth by 1.5 percentage points versus the same quarter. And this is the same trend we saw last quarter. Last quarter and this quarter, we're in our toughest comps. As you remember, we started to see recycled paper prices really come off hard coming into this year, but last year, they were at all-time highs. So you have sort of the 2 worst comparisons. This trend will get better with time on a comparison basis and in fact, will be some -- we think somewhat better in Q4, as we lap it, but going into next year, these issues should go away.","FX reduced reported revenue growth rates by about 2%. The storage rental, which you all know, hopefully you did hear the message at ID and you've heard for years, is the key driver of our business, remained on track at 4% in constant dollar terms. North America's on track with their historical trends and International continued to generate solid strong double-digit growth. The annuity rental revenue stream that we value so highly remains durable, and still operates in the sort of 3% to 5% constant dollar range that we've been doing for some time.","Service revenues continued its pattern, this quarter, was down 6%. Lower recycled paper prices drove more than half of that, which I just spoke about. The other weakness in routine services, the patterns remained consistent and there were no really changes in those trends. And in addition, we saw a little softness in Europe, primarily in the U.K., and primarily driven around the 2 back-to-back Olympics that they had there, and the congestion and traffic. And frankly, customer impact of them going solid for quite an extended period, and we have a large business there and we saw some impact from that. And again, all that should rebound fine.","We sustained OIBDA -- adjusted OIBDA margins, despite the service headwinds and despite the lower paper prices -- and I should remind you that recycled paper is a 100% margin. So when it comes off as it did, it came off reasonably hard, holding margins for the whole company is a bit of a struggle, and it takes a lot of good execution. The team did a great job. We had programs in place, and we've been working quite a while consistently on corporate and divisional overhead, and we continue to execute those programs. And the team did well, and that's how we were able to make that happen. Plus, we were realizing and recording benefits from the International margin expansion program that we've been talking to you about.","In fact, International is performing well and on track with their 3-year margin expansion goals. In Q4, we're going to actually allow them to -- since they've got -- their plans are working as they expect, and they've got extra execution capacity, we're going to accelerate some investments into Q4. Brian will give you a little more details related to facility consolidations to improve our facility network utilization and frankly, will derive future benefits, and we'll take an expense that we might have waited a while to take into the future and accelerate it into this quarter, take advantage of the execution opportunities and accelerate the realization of those benefits.","The acquisitions, which were a key part of our International growth strategy, particularly in the emerging markets, are on track in terms of integration and so far, they're proceeding well and we're finding no surprises. International remains on track towards their roughly 25% margin target in 2013.","So as I said, the business is running as we expected it would. We're still dealing with some extraneous noise factors in paper and FX, but the fundamentals of the business are running fine, and we're about executing the business and continue to drive it forward. At Investor Day, we discussed several themes, and I don't want to repeat 4, 5 hours of our discussion, but I'll give you just a brief discussion for those who weren't there, and make sure that you understand the things we really were talking about. And first is, is our focus on storage rental revenue, which is the driver of the business. And we store boxes of paper and tapes and a variety of other things and it's out of that, that drives the majority of the revenue, the majority of the gross margin and profits and free cash flow of the business.","We derive that from a global real estate network that's substantial in size of over 64 million square feet of real estate, of which we own nearly 40%. We lease the balance. And it's nearly 1,000 -- 994 is we should say, properties spread across 32 countries. And as we've talked about at I-Day, one of the things we see as an advantage of and an offshoot of, assuming a successful REIT conversion, that we have an opportunity to leverage our cost of capital and financing to really reorient, slowly, our balance sheet over time to tune our weighted average cost of capital by the acquisition of a significant number -- additional number of these leased facilities, where we would change from a lease financing type of debt to a third-party type of debt in order to reduce our cost of debt. And that's one of the things we've talked about there as a benefit of moving forward towards a REIT.","As you know, we decided to pursue a REIT structure after divesting our additional services business a couple of years ago, and we did that. But given our heavy real estate ownership and focus on storage, we felt, after a lot of analysis and a lot of deep work, that a REIT approach is something that, of course, we looked at before, but at this point in our strategy, we felt that it aligned with our business strategy. And part of that opportunity was getting out of the digital services business that sort of changed our perspective on the ability to make that work. And part of it was, that as we got out of the digital services business, we really refocused our business back on our core storage. And that focus had been lost for a while as we were chasing the digital business, and we're starting to see the advantages. It's a slow turn of a battleship. The business didn't go negative. It just didn't grow as well as it could have, and we're starting to see that battleship's turning, and we think the business has got a good solid future, and we'll continue to grow it and continue to evolve a very strong, high cash-generating storage business.","And therefore, the REIT approach aligns with this real estate driven business and aligns with the capital allocation strategy that we set forth, which is invest and enhance the long durability, the long-term durability of the storage business, but also to return excess free cash flow or excess capital back to our shareholders. And we've shifted our strategy in that vein. You've seen us increase our normal dividend flow, and our dividend flow over time. And of course, the REIT structure is a more disciplined approach that requires more discipline. Nothing comes for free and nothing comes easy. But requires more discipline in distribution of cash to the shareholders, result in a much higher dividend rate, result in certain other requirements to pay those dividends in that nothing comes free. But as we looked at our business plan and we looked at the capital allocation strategy and we looked at our models for the future, we think we found a balanced approach and a way to make it work and be good for everybody. So we continue to pursue that strategy.","As you know, and at our Investor Day or the morning of our Investor Day on October 11, we announced an E&P distribution. That is a pre-requisite requirement for becoming a REIT, but I want to stress that -- the fact that we announced that E&P distribution early -- first, it's something we told you some time ago we plan to do, and second, is not any indication that we have any information about the probability of success of being -- getting a private letter ruling from the IRS. We're not giving any signals whatsoever, except that we're following through on our commitment that we have made some time ago, and that commitment was founded in the basic capital allocation strategy we put forth. And we had told you that we were going to  dividend out or buy in stock, and distribute a significant amount of our excess capital. And we feel like that doing the E&P distribution, although it is in the path of becoming a REIT and a requirement of becoming a REIT, it also fits in with our capital allocation strategy. So even if we're not successful, as we told you before, we would go forward with that distribution, and we are in the process of doing that.","There have been some questions of people about the mechanics. So I want to go through it with you a little bit because you have a choice or a decision to make, and absent a decision, the default position, and I just want to make sure everybody understands what your options are.  The distribution we announced was $700 million to be distributed on November 21. The record date was October 22. This was designed and intended to be an ordinary and qualified dividend, and not intended to be a return of capital from a tax or accounting perspective. We intend to pay 80% of it in stock and 20% in cash. And you, as our investors, have an election, and you should be looking out for mailings or notifications or whoever is controlling your securities, but you have to make an election to determine the ultimate split. So shareholders of record should have received that election materials by now. There's also an 8-K filed with the relevant information, and it's available on our website for the details.","But a little bit about the election. You can choose to receive all cash or all stock. You can't choose a mix in between. So it's option a, all cash; option b, all stock. And the value of the shares to be distributed will be determined based on the closing prices of the 3 days following November 14. Investors who don't vote or don't get their votes in by 5 p.m. on November 14, by default, will receive all stock. Investors who choose stock will receive all stock. Investors who choose cash will receive a pro rata share of the available pool of cash, that is $140 million, based on the overall election results. So it's important if you want all stock, you don't have to do anything. If you want a pro rata amount of cash, you have to make an election that says all cash. We will complete the balance of the E&P -- well before I get to that, I hope everybody understands that you have to make a decision unless you want all stock. I think it boils down to that. So look out for the technicalities. Reach out to your brokers for the individuals involved in the call and so forth, and make sure that you make a conscious decision. Look at the 8-K. Look at our website. Make yourself an educated consumer here so -- as you make a conscious decision.","After this, assuming we get a successful opinion and letter ruling from the IRS, and that is an assumption, we will complete the E&P -- an E&P distribution, but we have to distribute all of our E&P up through the end of 2013, sometime during 2014, assuming we're successful. There will not be an E&P distribution or there's not expected to be one in 2013. After 2014, there would likely be some additional small E&P distributions as we integrate more of our International operations into the QRS TRS structure of being a REIT, but they will be relatively small, and would come in over the next couple of years.","So I hope that this clarifies any questions that would come around about what your choices are and your options are, and I hope that you understand the actions that you need to take. When we get to the Q&A in a little while, we'll obviously try to answer other questions if you have some.","Another question we've been receiving is, since the E&P distribution, the stock portion effectively operates like a stock split, except that you do get high basis stock. And that is a position that I find many shareholders still have trouble wrapping their brain around.  That high basis stock has an extreme value to you, and you can convert that anytime you want it to cash. But assuming that -- you know, on a share count basis, it operates like a split and that's the way the stock traded. The question we've come into is, will we hold our dividend rate -- our quarterly dividend that we've been distributing, will we hold the dividend rate the same or will we adjust it downward by -- because of the increased number of shares. And although we have not made -- the board has not voted, and it is their choice and their decision, on what the next quarterly dividend will be, and they will not do that until our regularly scheduled meeting in December, management expects to recommended that the board maintain the current dividend on a per share basis. Assuming that the board adopts management's position, this would amount to an increase of nearly 10% in the dividend payout, the amount of cash being paid out, over our current levels, and given the issuance of that much more new shares.","This is all in keeping with our capital allocation policy. We've been very clear and that policy's in place, REIT or no REIT. And we're continuing to move down that path and frankly, we're in a dual path here of pursuing a REIT and trying to be successful there. But if we're not successful there, we're on a path of distributing a significant amount of free cash flow to our shareholders. And either way, we will make that work.","So that's where we are. A good operated quarter, not a lot to talk about. Be happy to take your questions in a minute. Let me turn it over to Brian, and then we'll come back.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid operating performance in Q3 supported by durable storage rental growth. Our profit results are on track, and continue to be supported by International margin gains and benefits from overhead cost controls.  Storage rental grew 3 -- grew 4% on a constant dollar basis in Q3, reflecting consistent gains in North America and 12% growth in International, including benefits from our recently completed acquisitions in Brazil and Europe. Overall business trends were consistent with continued impacts from pressure on activity-based services. Reported results were constrained, as expected, by significantly lower recycled paper prices and weakened foreign currencies. Recycled paper prices were down 37% year-on-year, reducing revenues and profits by $11 million in the quarter. The year-on-year impact of lower paper prices will lessen in Q4, as we begin to lap the sharp price decline that began in Q4 of 2011. Unfavorable FX changes reduced growth rates by about 2%. Excluding these macro factors, revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 1% and 2%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis.","Good performance in the quarter is keeping us on track to achieve our full year financial goals. As we head into the fourth quarter, we're narrowing our full year guidance ranges. We're reiterating our adjusted OIBDA midpoint. We're also pulling in the top end of our revenue range to reflect year-to-date performance and current FX and paper pricing levels. I'll speak more to these and other refinements to our year end outlook later in my remarks.","Let's now turn to Slide 4, and review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2011. As noted, Q3 results were constrained by recycled paper and FX impacts. Lower year-on-year paper pricing reduced revenue growth by 1.5% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 4.4%. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar reduced reported growth rates by an additional 2%. Excluding these impacts, our underlying operating performance was solid, reflecting consistent business trends. Enterprise revenue growth was flat on a constant dollar basis. C$ storage revenue growth of 4% was offset by a 6% C$ decline in service revenues, with about half of the service decline related to lower paper pricing.","From a segment perspective, North America posted constant currency revenue growth of minus 3%. Storage rental grew 1.5% constant dollar but, as expected, these gains were offset by pressures on service revenues. Overall North American service revenues declined 9.5%, constant dollar, in the quarter. Excluding paper price changes, North American service growth was down 6%, constant dollar.","Gains in DMS revenues were offset by decreased core service activity levels and lower revenues from fuel surcharges, shredding and fulfillment services.","Our International segment posted 8% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 12% storage rental growth. These results reflect sustained growth in Europe, continued double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia Pacific and benefits from our recently completed acquisitions in Brazil and Switzerland. These gains were augmented by strong DMS service and project revenues, which offset impacts from lower paper prices and lower revenues from shredding services and other activity-based services in some of our mature markets.","Gross profit was $438 million in Q3, yielding a gross margin of 58.5%, down 160 basis points compared to the same prior-year period. Storage gross margins increased 110 basis points, reflecting lower occupancy costs and personal property taxes. Service gross margins were down year-over-year due to decreased recycled paper revenues and a mix shift away from higher margin core services towards relatively lower margin businesses, including DMS. The previously disclosed reclassification of certain overhead expenses to cost of sales was also a contributing factor.","We continue to offset pressure from factors such as lower paper pricing to maintain strong adjusted OIBDA margins. Adjusted OIBDA was $244 million or 32.6% of revenues in Q3. Higher storage rental gross profits, strong performance in our International business and benefits from overhead cost initiatives offset negative impacts from lower paper prices and lower service activity. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.34 per share compared to $0.40 in Q3 of 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted OIBDA, higher DNA due to -- primarily to acquisitions and increased interest expense related to our recent debt financing transactions in support of shareholder payouts and the REIT conversion. These impacts more than offset the benefits of fewer shares outstanding following our substantial share repurchases in 2011. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, Special Committee and prior-year proxy costs of $11 million in 2012 and $1 million in 2011. These costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.04 per share. By definition, these items have been excluded from our calculations of adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Reported earnings per share of $0.31 includes $11 million of REIT costs, $8 million of other expense and the impact of a higher effective tax rate due to foreign currency losses and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 41%.","Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q3 and year-to-date growth rates are trending in line with our full year expectations by major revenue type. In terms of C$ growth, storage rental remains on track towards our 4% full year C$ growth outlook. Overall C$ growth was down slightly in Q3, impacted by lower recycled paper pricing and continued pressures on activity-based services. As noted, we worked through our toughest comparisons on the recycled paper front, and we remain on track for full year C$ growth in the range of 0% to 2%.","In terms of components building to overall growth, storage rental internal growth at 2.4% was in line with our expectations. The storage rental business remains durable and on track towards our full-year goals. Net global records management volume was up nearly 2% on a year-on-year basis in Q3. International storage rental growth was 5% -- storage internal revenue growth was 5% for the quarter, reflecting sustained double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia Pac. International storage rental growth moderated somewhat from very strong Q2 levels, reflecting recent softness in Europe. North America reported 1.5% internal storage rental growth, with consistent pricing trends in the 1.5% to 2% range. Overall, North America volume has remained relatively flat over the last several quarters. We saw a modest year-on-year decline in North American volume in Q3, as we were up against our toughest quarterly comparison, but we remain on track towards 2% storage rental growth and sustained volume this year.","Storage service internal growth was minus 8% or down 5% excluding impacts from commodity changes. Core service internal growth was minus 4% in the quarter, as growth in DMS services was more than offset by lower fuel surcharges and shredding service revenues and expected decline in activity-based core services.  Complementary service revenues, representing about 11% of total revenues, decreased 17% internally. Results were driven primarily by an $11 million decline in recycled paper revenues, similar to Q2. Paper prices have recently come off their summer highs, and are now at about $150 per ton. Assuming they remain stable for the balance of the year, the gap should narrow as we begin to lap the steep decline that started in Q4 of 2011. As noted, FX rate changes had a 2% negative impact, which pressured reported results.","Let's now take a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 6. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date 2012 performance compared to 2011. Our year-to-date performance reflects consistent business trends. Reported revenue of $2.2 billion is up 1% on a constant dollar basis, as continued solid storage gains offset impacts from lower recycled paper prices and soft core service activity. Lower paper prices and the SG&A re-class discussed previously have lead to a modest decline in gross margins. Despite these impacts, adjusted OIBDA is flat year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. Strong International profit performance and overhead cost initiatives are key factors in this improvement. We expect these factors to continue to support profit performance as we move forward. Adjusted EPS is $0.99 per share, down 2% year-to-date. Lower adjusted OIBDA, higher DNA and interest expense offset the benefits from fewer shares outstanding.","2012 capital spending is $114 million, excluding $23 million of acquired real estate and $3 million of REIT conversion CapEx. As a percent of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate, is 5.1%, in line with prior year levels. Capital expenditures historically increase in the second half of the year. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending efficiency targets in 2012.","Free cash flow through Q3 was $209 million compared to $315 million for the first 3 quarters of 2011. The decrease is due primarily to higher cash taxes compared to low 2011 levels, higher interest expense in support of our shareholder payout program, and the lapping of lower cash incentive compensation payments in 2011. We remain on track towards our full year free cash flow targets as well. The adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS here exclude year-to-date costs associated with the REIT conversion Special Committee and prior year proxy costs, which were $16 million in 2012 and $15 million in 2011. These year-to-date costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.06. In addition to the $3 million of REIT-related CapEx I just discussed, we paid $36 million in taxes towards our DNA recapture liability. All told, these items would reduce free cash flow by about $49 million year-to-date. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT costs and related expenditures in the appendix to this presentation.","Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to the same period in 2011. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining higher returns in our North American segment, while continuing to build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. Year-to-date, our North American business segment reported revenues of $1.7 billion, supported by consistent 2% C$ storage rental gains. Despite the impacts of lower recycled paper prices, we sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%. We're also sustaining capital efficiencies while spending at 4% of revenues, excluding real estate.","Our International segment continues to post solid constant dollar revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 14% on a C$ basis. We're benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Asia Pac. International adjusted OIBDA margins expanded 150 basis points. Benefits from productivity initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio has us on track towards our business plan goals of approximately 25% margins in 2013.","As Richard mentioned, we're tracking to our International margin improvement plan, and we've decided to accelerate certain building moves in London. This would result in about $6 million of additional expense in Q4 that will drive future benefits and won't interfere with our 3-year margin expansion goals. Finally, corporate expenses declined 7% compared with prior year levels, reflecting benefits from overhead cost control initiatives. Overall, we continue to drive strong operating performance across our portfolio.","Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 8. Strong consistent cash flow generation has enabled us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We're currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.6x, comfortably within our target at 3 to 4x leverage range. As we discussed at Investor Day, our leverage ratio will increase as we make shareholder payouts and expenditures in connection with the REIT conversion process.","In anticipation of these cash outlays, we completed a very successful bond offering in August. We sold $1 billion of 5 3\/4% bonds due in 2024. This was the lowest interest rate for a debt offering of our credit rating in the history of the high-yield market. We used the net proceeds to retire $320 million of 6 5\/8% bonds and $200 million of 8 3\/4% bonds and to pay down our line of credit. As a result, we're well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was $1.1 billion with $335 million in cash and $722 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our debt portfolio also remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is down at 6.5%, and we're nearly 87% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is about 7.6 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014.","Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our shareholder payout strategy. During the third quarter, we paid $46 million in regular quarterly dividends at a rate of $0.27 per share. As part of our planned conversion to a REIT, earlier this month, we announced that the first portion of our E&P purge will be paid out in November. We'll be distributing $700 million to our shareholders, using up to $140 million in cash and the balance in stock. This will result in our issuing about 17 million new shares based on current share prices.","As Richard mentioned, management expects to recommend that the board, at its regularly scheduled meeting in December, maintain the $0.27 per share rate rather than reduce it based on the new higher numbers of share outstanding -- shares outstanding. This will result in an increase to our dividend payout levels of nearly 10% over current levels. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders, and we remain well-positioned to fund our business plan.","That concludes our review of Q3 2012 results. Overall, we continue to drive solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our goals in 2012.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our 2012 full year outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our current 2012 operating outlook. Today, we're reiterating our midpoint projection for adjusted OIBDA, while tightening the range by $20 million. We're also lowering the top end of our revenue projections by $20 million to reflect year-to-date results and current FX and recycled paper levels. We're projecting 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $2,990,000,000 to $3,020,000,000 or 1% to 3% C$ growth, excluding the impact of lower paper prices. We're maintaining our outlook for adjusted OIBDA, while narrowing the range to be between $900 million to $920 million on an operating basis. This outlook includes about $10 million of costs related to real estate transactions that will support increased network utilization. We also expect to incur severance costs related to select organizational changes in Q4. Adjusted EPS for 2012 is now expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.28. In addition to the narrowing of the adjusted OIBDA range, we've updated the adjusted EPS range to reflect increased interest due to our recent financing. The calculation of adjusted EPS assumes a 40% structural rate and 172 million shares outstanding. Assuming we issue about 17 million shares to pay for -- to pay a portion of the E&P purge, our weighted average shares outstanding for the full year will increase about 2 million shares and adjusted EPS will be reduced by about $0.01 per share.","We now expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $245 million, including an estimated $50 million for real estate. As noted on Investor Day, the increase reflects a real estate lease buyout opportunity we're taking advantage of in North America. Our outlook for our operating free cash flow continues to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million. As highlighted in our announcement to pursue conversion to a REIT, we intend to pay significant one-time operating and capital costs associated with the conversion. Total operating expense and capital costs are estimated to be between $100 million to $150 million, with the majority deployed over the next 2 years. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. The effort's underway, and we'll be breaking out and reporting on estimated impacts as we advance the process.","For 2012, in addition to the operating expectations discussed above, we expect to incur between $25 million and $30 million of incremental expense, $10 million in CapEx, and to pay about $80 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction in reported EPS of about $0.09 to $0.10 per share and a use of cash between $105 million and $108 million. As noted, the slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the related items, are included in the appendix.","That concludes our review. In summary, Q3 was another quarter of good financial performance and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2012. We continue to execute against our 3-year plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America, while driving stronger growth and higher returns in our International business, and we continue to advance work in connection with the REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value for shareholders. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Samford with Citigroup.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The impact of Sandy, I believe you've said that some potential impact to services. Can you provide just a little bit of history on your geographic concentration in the tri-state area and the sort of prior natural disaster impacts that might have impacted your business.","C. Richard Reese","Oh, we have significant facilities in that area. I couldn't tell you how many off the top of my head on how many square feet, but it's significant. You can assume that Metro New York, New Jersey is one of our largest, if not, largest market geographically. Historically, we've had other natural disasters. We've been through a bunch. This one's a pretty big one, it looks like. It's a little early to tell the impact on customers. But you'll see a wiggle, what we'd call a wiggle in the revenue. Storage doesn't get impacted. It might get delayed by a week or 2 coming in, but that's not a significant impact. What happens is, is service will decline. Your transportation and retrieval\/refile activity will decline. That type of service, I'm just trying to parse in my head real quick, is not a major part of our service line of revenue. So I would -- net-net, it's a few million dollars, I'm guessing right now, but it's not $100 million. It's not even $50 million. I bet it's not $10 million. It's a few million dollars that we'll see. But we kind of keep track of everything, so we just wanted to let you know that's happening. Just like the London Olympics. You can see the difference on a year-over-year comparison the thing's so steady.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I guess, just a quick -- I assume your 2013 outlook is still sort of on track at this point, that you provided at Analyst Day?","C. Richard Reese","Yes, we just -- all this will be -- I don't like -- or I guess I do like to call it noise, I call it noise a lot. It's noise, but it just explains why things move a little bit here and there. But yes, we don't see any change in the trajectory of the business.","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, I'd just say on the service front, to Richard's point, it's early to tell. It will be more at the margin. I think, right now, we don't have a good sense of how long the delays might be in place, so that's...","C. Richard Reese","As we spoke, I just got an e-mail telling me that one of our high-activity facilities, New York, New Jersey area, we just got into it, as in to be able to be up and running, delivering services. We've been into it, but not been able to deliver services. So it looks like it's back online at these facilities. Now we'll have to wait and see whether our customers are online and so forth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Could you tell us what your outlook is in services demand, x paper prices, and when you might see a re-acceleration in the activity-based services and what might drive that?","C. Richard Reese","Well, I don't know that we -- well, there's 2 components to the activity-based services. One, the big driver down still is our healthcare business, which we have said constantly is a business that, frankly, slowly is going away. Not the business itself. It's changing its nature. It's becoming a much less active storage business. And so the activity, which that is our most activity vertical segment, is coming way off. The storage side of the business is growing nicely, but the activity side is coming off. That trend will continue slowly for quite a while, okay? And then you have activity clients related to just all data getting less active. That's also a slower -- that's also a slow trend. And then third, you have economic activity declines, and we talked a lot about this in Investor Day. It's hard to parse which percentage. I mean, we know what's going on in the healthcare, which is a big part of it. But add it all up, you're talking $15 million to $20 million headwind in terms of total services on an annual basis. And I think if we had good robust economies, and as we weed through some of this, that might come down by 1\/3 or somewhere like that. That's a guess though. That's not a precise answer.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Right, got it. And you mentioned extra execution capability driving the accelerated investments in the fourth quarter. Could you provide additional details on where the investments are going and what benefits or returns you're expecting to realize from the investments?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, so we'll have -- as I have noted, George, we've got about $10 million of real estate transactions in the fourth quarter. The biggest one is we're consolidating volume in London. We have excess capacity and we're going to close a facility. That's about a $6 million impact. We've got some investments in the U.S. as well. We're consolidating volume at an existing -- we have an existing lease facility that we're going to move out of and take a charge there. And we've got some investments going around just in terms of upgrading facilities as well. And net-net -- that's factored into our outlook. We're counting on that next year, but those will have benefits in terms of reduced rental costs going into next year. So I think Richard's point on the international front was the team's been executing extremely well. We feel very good about the -- getting to our 2013 goals and I think we've got some ability here to move things forward. Good return activity forward and faster, and we're going to take advantage of that.","C. Richard Reese","I mean, the team's basically, and we've done this before, they've come to us and they said, \"Look, we -- our plans for this year are pretty cooked, and they're operating and the margins are flowing and so forth.\" And if we will relieve them on a reported basis from -- let them have some more expense in Q4 on a reported basis, they'll accelerate and get at more, and so those are good decisions, and so we said, \"Sure, let's do it.\"","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. I want to just have just a follow-up on that question a little bit, and something that we talked about at Investor Day. But obviously is, you guys kind of cull through your portfolio of real estate and converting some leases to maybe purchase facilities, et cetera, and maybe some consolidation. How far are you through that process of really looking at that portfolio and how much value might there to be unlocked as kind of we go forward through that process?","Brian P. McKeon","Well, I think, we're -- to a degree, we've had a level of activity going on for a long time, right? Building consolidations are a normal part of what we do, and so that work continues. I think the opportunity we highlighted at Investor Day was we have basically a $2.5 billion universe in potential investment opportunity between buying out leases and investing. And the real estate and expansion markets, kind of a probability-based view on that. We put out an estimate of $1 billion deployment, perhaps, over a long period of time and...","C. Richard Reese","And buying in an existing lease facility is not to be confused with moving out and consolidating an inventory. They're really kind of separate transactions, okay? If we're consolidating inventory, we're typically either moving out of an owned building and selling the building or moving out of a lease and taking a charge because the present value of where we're going justifies that investment. Those are separate decisions. We would tend to buy-in buildings, buy-in leases, where we have high-quality buildings, good real estate, and where the cost of financing it in an acquired mode is cheaper than the cost of the lease that we have. And oftentimes, that occurs at a lease renewal cycle or when landlords want to get some liquidity out of their portfolio, and so on a negotiated basis.","Brian P. McKeon","So one way to look at is if we got $1 billion, you'd say the majority of that is lease buyouts. If we've got a cap rate of 8%, on average, on leases, if we can finance at a lower rate directly, that will be a net benefit to us. So that might give you a sense of kind of the net annualized benefit we could realize over time from the financing side of that. And we'll continue to increase our network utilization through other activities like building those, as Richard talking about.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then second question. We talked a little bit on the services in terms of some of the headwinds and also kind of the shredding services being down a little bit. Is competition getting a little bit hotter in that in terms of, at least, here in Chicago, we see some more competitors and some more trucks around? Is that a big concern or is that just on the periphery?","C. Richard Reese","Well, the competition is always a concern because of -- and sure, the shredding business has some large players and a lot, a lot, a lot of small players, and it's a reasonably easy-entry business for the small players. But our shredding services, the bend [ph] tips and the number stops and all the activities are up and continue to grow quite nicely, but what we're suffering is -- we're suffering 2 things: some price decline, which is competitive-market driven, but a lot driven off of a rollover of some very large enterprise accounts quite some years ago in a different market environment, and which we then are repricing themselves or getting repriced to current markets. But the big driver is the paper itself. I mean, the paper is a key driver of revenue and profitability in that business, and it's gone from an all-time high to not quite an all-time low, but a much lower number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","[Audio Gap]","growth, I know you said it was in line with expectations, but it was different than the second quarter rate. Could you just go over those differences again? You went through them quickly. And do you think that the fourth quarter storage growth will be similar to the third?","Brian P. McKeon","Andrew, we missed the very beginning of your question. Was your question about storage growth?","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, so my question is about the internal growth of 2.4% in storage, which you noted was in line with your expectations, but it was different than the 4% in the second quarter. Could you just go over those differences? And do you feel like the fourth quarter storage growth internally will be similar to the third?","Brian P. McKeon","So the differences -- we had a very good Q2. The International number came down from 7% to 5%, and that was primarily just reduction from mid-double-digit growth in Latin America to 12%-ish type growth. It was -- we had very good rates. It was just a bit lower. And we did see some -- we had a very good Q2 in Europe, and that's came back down to more normalized levels, I'd argue.","C. Richard Reese","And there's seasonality in the storage side of the business, which lends itself to the first half of the year versus the second half of the year.","Brian P. McKeon","North America, as I mentioned, was down a bit. It was 1.5 versus 2.  And that it really is just kind of the quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year comparisons. We were up against the kind of volume built through Q3 of last year, and came down a bit early this year. But net-net, it's been really quite flat. We would expect to see some of those compares be a bit better in Q4. So we're comfortable we're on track to the 4% full year number and the 3% internal number we've been talking about.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. But there's not a lot of difference when you talk about the fourth quarter storage internal growth rate than the third quarter, no other things to call out?","Brian P. McKeon","No, more similar than different, which is typical in our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","[Audio Gap]","on that and dig in a bit into the North American storage. It sounds like the business is flat x pricing and I guess that's been the recent trend, not just this quarter. But what's baked into that mid-term view or the -- was it through 2016 view that you gave at the Investor Day? Is that a continuation of flat North American volumes? And how confident are you that there's not a -- that we're not going to actually see the volume start to decline a bit?","Brian P. McKeon","Well, we -- just going back to Investor Day, we talked about the longer-term outlook being 1% to 3%, including a 1.5% to 2% pricing. So that it is basically flat volume, with revenue growth primarily coming from pricing. And our churn has been stable in North America, what's flowing out. The incoming volume has come down moderately in terms of new sales and organic growth from customers, but we can augment that through additional activities, as well as through things like tuck-in acquisitions or customer acquisitions. And we feel quite confident that we can -- it's a very slow change, and that we can offset that through good return investments that keep the volume flowing in. So we're...","C. Richard Reese","And I think -- look, there's no guarantee about the future in anything, but if you look forward -- look where we are today, look forward versus look back, that you'll see significantly more focus of resources, asset, organization towards driving storage. And that's in marketing programs, sales programs, compensation programs. Everybody is aligned around this agenda, and that was not true looking backwards, and so -- and it will have benefits.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just following on that, and I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but the thought process around buying in a lot of real estate, if it sounds like we're at a situation were flat is the expectation, how do you think about the decision to buy properties in North America if it's really not growing? I mean, would you buy them in markets where you'd have the ability to consolidate another facility into it if it shrinks? It seems to me, the math isn't quite so obvious if there's the potential for weaker volumes.","C. Richard Reese","Sure. No, look, it's a local market -- it's not a local market decision, it's a local market analysis. If you were to -- and you do run the models of what if the business shrank over the next 50 years and so forth, what's your last building standing, what's your next-to-last building standing and so forth and so on, and those are the obvious ones you want to buy. Okay? And you run your portfolio that way. You also recognize that if you were in a declining situation, you're probably better off to own the real estate so you can have more flexibility of reselling it into the open market than you would be committed to a long lease. So you increase the flexibility of your portfolio, but we're not talking about -- relative to the size of our portfolio, we're not talking about buying in that many of the buildings over time, okay, to make that issue a serious issue. And the last, and certainly not least, is that we would likely deploy -- I don't know if I'd say a disproportion amount, disproportion amount relative to the size of the business, for sure, in emerging markets, where the real estate arbitrage is much, much higher. The cost of debt capital, the cost of lease capital, so to speak, and financing in emerging markets is in line with venture capital returns, and we would likely deploy a significant amount in places like that. And I use kind of over and over the example that we've now gone outside of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and bought 10 acres of land, and we're going to build a campus there because we can drive very, very much better economics, and we've got a very good, growing business there. And a lot of facilities we can -- on leases we can get out of that we can consolidate out of into.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one clean-up one. What exactly are the organizational changes in the severance? Is that any -- is that a material number or you're just cleaning a few things up?","Brian P. McKeon","It's in the range of $5 million to $7 million in Q4, and we've got a few different things going on, but basically, we're -- it's part of ongoing productivity-based initiatives we're looking at, where we can be more efficient in the company, and that's what it's related to. So it's more than one activity. They're smaller in terms of their individual scope, but net-net, we do expect a fair bit of severance cost to pull through Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","You guys were discussing the weather impact from Sandy and addressing some of the short-term issues it could have on service. Is there a potential for a positive impact, longer-term, perhaps? And with, I would imagine, very elevated insurance claims, is that something that could show up in 2013?","Brian P. McKeon","Well, I think if we -- I think it's too early to call that. It's -- net-net, I don't think that will be a net benefit to us. It's just too early to call.","C. Richard Reese","Look, I think the only -- generally speaking, the only positive that comes out of these kind of messes are is -- is in certain customers will have heightened awareness around the quality of their own operations and where they're storing things and what they're doing, and be more open to making a change, and then there will likely be a few customers who have a bloody mess after this, and we may get called in to help fix it, which we do from time to time.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just -- it was covered fairly well at the Investor Day, but could you address, Richard, the main verticals, financial services, healthcare, legal, for instance, just what you see for the intermediate-term outlook, the next 12 to 18 months?","C. Richard Reese","In what respect?","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just anything that would deviate from how they've been trending, particularly, healthcare, over the next year or so.","C. Richard Reese","Well, let's take healthcare. What we see in healthcare is a consistent trend. We see actually good, great opportunity inside the healthcare space, as they computerize their health records and so forth. They don't get rid of the paper records for lots of real reasons, good reasons. So we see lots of storage opportunity in the space. We see lots of -- some hybrid or digital scanning opportunities and things like that. I don't know if we see a trend, but they're kind of in the middle of that, and they've got some years of work. The trend is the bigger hospitals started a long time ago, and the bigger healthcare systems, and the smaller ones are still working through it, trying to figure out how to do it. Financial services, what you see there is -- I mean you know it's an industry that's under pressure, and they push that pressure back at their vendors, and we see a lot of that. We see their activity rates have been down since 2007 and '08, come back slightly. Which is the same thing you guys see in the capital markets, okay? If we get robust markets and robust trading and robust everything else, I'm sure their activities -- everybody will be smiling better and their activities will be up and so forth. So I'd say you would see us -- whatever your outlook is for a given vertical in terms of their economic activity, you will see that'll flow through to us, and you'll see that the service sides respond faster and the storage respond slower. There's a lag there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you just comment a little bit on Slide 12 where it looks like there's an increase in both organic additions and destructions? Can you provide any color as to what's going on kind of on a sequential basis?","Brian P. McKeon","Just finding the slide, Shlomo, sorry. And you're looking at the outgoing volume on Slide 12?","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, it looks like there was a step up both in outgoing volume and in organic additions, and I just wanted to know if there's any color you could provide behind that.","Brian P. McKeon","You do see there's some seasonality in numbers. I think, sometimes, it's important to look at Q3 to Q3 levels. I think what you see in the organic additions is they're relatively stable. And on the outgoing volume, Q3 to Q3 is actually down a bit and are now calling -- you typically have some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. It's driven -- and many times, larger events can cause quarter-to-quarterly fluctuation. I think, overall, if you look at where Q2 and Q3 are, they're actually down from where they were the prior 3 quarters, and so -- it's one of the reasons we talk about the compares year-on-year is we knew we had some increase in the outgoing volume a little earlier in the year, and that stabilized down so we have a tougher compare in Q3, but that should be sequentially a bit better as we get into Q4.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","What seasonality is there in this business? Can you just give us from a practical standpoint why there's a seasonality in 3Q? What is behind it, if that's indeed what this chart is saying, in your view?","C. Richard Reese","Seasonality in the business is more related -- you'll see a higher growth of storage in the first couple of quarters because people are cleaning out last year's records. That's the biggest trend you see in terms of gross adds, gross additions coming in.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the corporate, it seems like you guys are taking costs down in the OIB and that's positively impacting OIBDA. Can you talk about some of the items that happened that affected the quarter on a sequential basis?","Brian P. McKeon","On corporate costs, Shlomo?","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Brian P. McKeon","It's flow-through benefits of -- we had a number of initiatives we started advancing really late last year around looking at our support cost areas and trying to make sure they're well-aligned with good customer service, but also being as efficient as we can be, and we're seeing the flow-through benefits of that. So it's across a number of functional areas. It's something that we expect to continue to do on an ongoing basis, and I think what you're seeing more than anything is, given when we advance those initiatives, we're starting to see the flow-through benefits of those year-on-year.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the lower revenue from fuel surcharges, is this just index-based stuff that you just had lower charges so you had lower -- lower fuel so lower surcharges?","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, surcharges were down. Fuel prices have been down a bit and they were down about $1 million year-on-year in the quarter.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question I have, is this the first time you've had back-to-back quarters of sequential down volumes in North America? So we had last quarter, you noted it on the Analyst Day as well, but is this kind of a historical period? Or is this something that has really been happening over the last few years just it's so close to 0 that you haven't really called it out?","Brian P. McKeon","It's been basically flat. We're -- if you look at the volumes and how they've trended over the last several quarters, it's been up a bit, down slightly, but basically flat and we're expecting flat this year, so it's -- I would say the headline in storage is flat in North America.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'm not talking about revenue. I'm talking about volumes.","Brian P. McKeon","I am too. Storage volume is flat. Down a bit because of the compare of Q3 to Q3, and that reflects just some of the ebbing and flowing of volume coming in now. But as we go forward, we expect it to be flat. That's where we'll be this year. So that's really the broader theme, is it's relatively flat.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Apologize if you answered this already, but the components of the core services, I know part of that's fuel, part of it is just healthcare activity overall. Can you just bracket in kind of round numbers what drove the decline there and how you're thinking about healthcare, in particular? Richard, I know that continues to be an area that -- on the service side, that's been a little slower, just how we're thinking about that going forward?","C. Richard Reese","Well, I think -- we're thinking that healthcare is going to continue to decline and roughly come down to -- over quite a period of time, to about half of what it used to be. And it's got few more years before it will get itself to that level, I think. And I think the rest of it is more -- the bigger part of the rest of it is more economic activity. So it depends on the economies, what comes to on there, I think.","So thank you, everybody, for coming this morning. We do try to keep to at least an hour, and I started off extending it short. I've always misjudged that so I apologize to you. I know you have other calls to get to. Thanks for coming to Investor Day, and we look forward to continue to communicate with you, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Greer Aviv","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that we will be referring to in today\u2019s prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today\u2019s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information.","On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain\u2019s President and CEO, who will discuss second quarter performance and progress towards our strategic plans; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover additional financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today\u2019s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance. ","All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. ","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and a reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","Bill Meaney","Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We\u2019re very pleased with the continued durable revenue growth across our businesses and the improved operational execution in line with our previous outlook. Some of the highlights of the quarter included total organic storage revenue growth of 2.4% and total storage growth of 4.6%. We continue to make good progress in identifying new storage opportunity whilst organic volume increased 40 basis points in our global records management business. ","Good momentum driving improved operational efficiencies across the organization and data centers delivering strong organic growth. We have leased 7 megawatts through the second quarter in line with our full year expectation of 15 megawatts to 20 megawatts. Moreover, Q3 is getting off to a strong start with a 6-megawatt lease signed in Northern Virginia. ","Starting with a review of our financial and operating performance in the quarter, total revenue increased 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. This growth was driven an almost 5% increase in storage revenue, partly offset by lower service revenue growth reflecting lower recycled paper pricing, which I will touch on in a few minutes. ","The cost issues we experienced in Q1 were fully corrected during the quarter, which is evident in the sequential adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 210 basis points above the high end of the 150 basis points to 200 basis point margin expansion we guided to in our last call despite some onetime cost. As you saw from our press release this morning, we have tightened our guidance range is given we are halfway through the year and there has been less variability in FX rates than we expected when we provided our initial guidance. ","We now expect revenue to increase between 2% and 4% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to increase between 2% and 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis remaining within our initial guidance ranges. We remain focused on successfully executing in the second half despite some external headwinds with a strong finish to the year anticipated setting us up to enter 2020 in a good position. ","Turning back to Q2 performance, we also continued to see good organic growth with the organic storage revenue growth up 2.4% for the second quarter and 2.2% year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from data center, the other international segment, adjacent businesses in stable performance in Western Europe and North America.","Revenue management particularly in North America is trending ahead of our expectations. Total organic service revenue growth was negative 2% for the quarter and roughly flat year-to-date due to lower recycled paper prices. We expect this to remain a headwind for our service business for the remainder of 2019 as we cycle over record pricing a year ago. It should be noted, however, the headwinds from paper price on a year-over-year basis amount to $20 million to $30 million on what was last year $115 million of revenue from the sale of paper. The actions we have taken are more than enough for us to manage this headwind and maintain our profit goals, given it is less than 1% of the revenue in the overall business, albeit a little less than 2% of the profit.","Turning to business performance, we continued to see good growth in the alternative storage categories including adjacent businesses, consumer and other. Volume and consumer and other grew more than 760,000 cubic feet sequentially or 31% in part reflecting strong demand for high touch consumer storage during the peak season. And our records management business, we organically added roughly 3 million cubic feet of net record storage volume worldwide over the past 12 months representing 40 basis points of growth and increasing trend driven by both new sales and lower destruction. ","More specifically, Developed Markets organic volume declined by about 60 basis points. A slight improvement from Q1 organic volume growth in the other international segments continues to grow at a faster clip, increasing 3.4% driven by an increase in new sales of 9.7% and modestly lower destructions. We encouraged by the consistent performance of our global records management business and continued to see a solid commercial pipeline.","Shifting to our Digital Solutions business, we continue to support our customer\u2019s evolving needs by providing a number of Digital Solutions. To this point, our Information Governance and Digital Solution team or IGDS at a very good Q2 with a number of wins in a healthy pipeline that is expected to deliver strong double-digit revenue growth this year.","In conjunction with our Federal team, IGDS was awarded a nearly $13 million contract from General Dynamics Information Technology under a sub agreement Iron Mountain will perform work is part of a digital transformation initiative for a government agency. As it relates to our Iron Mountain insight platform and partnership with Google, we continue to see good momentum for this innovative solution, which is powered by existing Iron Mountain products and services adding even more value to our portfolio of Digital Solutions. In Q2, we signed a deal with a large financial services customer for a comprehensive solution to manage the document workflow process of auto loans.","In addition to providing this customer with scanning and secure storage of loan documents, insight extracts and validates the data, verifies the signatures and certifies authenticity of the loans and associated collateral. We decided this quarter to evaluate alternatives with regards to the infrastructure supporting select offerings within our Iron Cloud portfolio. ","We generally approach our Digital Solutions based on a hybrid model in terms of what we developed internally and who we can partner with for best-in-class technology solutions for the right cost. This evaluation has led us to a shift in partnership approach for some of our Iron Cloud solution such as object store and resulting in a onetime drag on our reported results this quarter, which Stuart will discuss in a moment.","Finally, as mentioned earlier, our data center business continues to build leasing momentum in conjunction with the build out of our platform. As mentioned earlier in early July, we signed a 6-megawatt deployment in Northern Virginia, which is expected to commence later this year. I want to congratulate the data center team for the successful execution of this deal. It\u2019s a great accomplishment and should add significant value to our campus ecosystem. ","Looking at data center leasing activity in Q2, we signed 3 megawatts of new and expansion leases, primarily driven by enterprise demand. Year-to-date, including the new lease in Northern Virginia just mentioned, we have leased 13 megawatts with clear line of sight to achieving the high end of our annual target of 15 megawatts to 20 megawatts. ","Furthermore, we continue to demonstrate the strengths of our customer relationships when winning retail sales focused on large enterprises building private cloud infrastructure. Consistent with the first quarter activity approximately 40% of our leasing pipeline, we\u2019ve generated by our non-data center sales team. Cross selling opportunities like this will continue to help us realize synergies as the data center business growth.","As it relates to development activity, we are on track to deliver the first phase of new capacity at our Phoenix campus expansion with the grand opening scheduled for August 15, and an additional 5 megawatts of capacity scheduled to be delivered across the three international markets in Q3.","In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of Iron Mountain with continued improvement in global storage organic revenue and volume growth, enabling us to continue to invest in new growth areas to support our long-term business model. We are encouraged by the momentum we see in our data center business and we\u2019ll continue to expand that platform and drive further synergies across the business. Whilst our digital services and solutions are helping our customers solve new business challenges. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart Brown","Thank you, Bill. Thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2019 results. As Bill mentioned, we are pleased with our second quarter performance with revenue of nearly $1.1 billion. Total revenues increased 0.6% or 3.1% excluding the impact of the stronger dollar. Our storage rental revenue increased 4.6% on a constant currency basis, driven in part by growth in our data center, emerging markets and adjacent businesses. Total service revenue increased 0.7% in constant currencies. ","As you can see on Slide 6, total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated to 2.4% in Q2, reflecting results from revenue management and global volume growth. More specifically, Developed Markets organic storage revenue growth came in at 1.3% for the quarter, reflecting continuing contributions from revenue management and volume trends.","In the other international segment, we achieved continued healthy organic storage revenue growth of 3.7%. Year-to-date, organic storage revenue growth was 2.2% and with the strong commercial pipeline and a modest decrease in records destructions, we now expect full year organic storage revenue growth of 2.2% to 2.8%. This underscores the consistency and durability of our high margin storage business and strength of our commercial teams.","Organic service revenue, however, declined 2% in the second quarter as we cycle over growth of 7.6% a year ago. This mainly reflects swing in paper prices, which were record highs last year and currently about 20% below the five-year average, driven in parts by two large paper mills in North America that were offline in Q2 and lower pulp prices leading to an oversupply of paper for recycling.","Assuming prices stay at these low levels, the year-over-year impact to revenue and adjusted EBITDA is about $25 million and assumed in our current outlook. Given this and lower destruction service revenue, we now expect service organic revenue growth to be flat to down 50 basis points for the full year and therefore total organic revenue growth to be in a range of 1.3% to 2% in 2019.","While reported service revenue was lower than we anticipated, remember that many of our services provide important support to our core storage business, promote deeper customer relationships and are increasingly designed to solve our customer\u2019s problems, managing and analyzing both physical and digital assets. Our digital services are growing nicely and we continue to evaluate test and grow them to enhance our business and grow new lines of revenue over time.","Lastly, as it relates to organic revenue growth, we generate some of our best returns on capital from acquisitions of customer relationships, which are not dissimilar from paying commissions to our sales teams, as we pay a local competitor for their customer contracts and integrate with our existing business.","We include the revenue as well as the investment is part of our organic growth, given their similarity to competitive takeaways, but the timing can be a bit lumpy. To give perspective, over the past three years, annual investments have range from $30 million to $70 million. These low risk, high returns sales enabled acquisitions are part of our core growth strategy, particularly in developed markets. Year-to-date, they have contributed about 60 basis points of the 2.2% total storage organic growth.","Now turning to our data center business, we are very pleased with the leasing progress momentum. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth around 6% in Q2 and signed 3.2 megawatts of new and expansion leases. Churn during the quarter was a more normal 1%, but this will vary over time given the size of our data center portfolio and we\u2019ll tick up again in Q3. Additionally, we agreed with one of our customers to shorten leases in two of our markets in exchange for higher rental income during the remainder of their modified term.","While this will generate elevated turn in the first quarter of 2020, this was a strong positive for our data center business has a freed up capacity in Northern Virginia, enabling us to win the 6 megawatt deployment that Bill mentioned.","As you can see on Slide 7, SG&A excluding significant acquisition costs grew about $8 million from a year ago. This was primarily caused by higher compensation expense related in part to the consolidation of acquisitions and our investment in a global operations support team, as well as by increased technology expense.","Our adjusted EBITDA declined $17 million year-over-year or 5% to $351 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA declined $9 million or 2.6%. As Bill mentioned, there were some \u2013 there were several one-time items that impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in the quarter. These included a $4 million charge related to our Iron Cloud infrastructure and the remainder for charges related to building damage that occurred during the quarter.","AFFO in the second quarter was $210 million compared to $228 million a year ago. This decreased reflects a stronger dollar and other changes impacting adjusted EBITDA, as well as somewhat higher interest expense in quarterly cash taxes, partly offset by lower non-real estate investments.","Slide 8 details the adjusted EBITDA margin performance by business segment. The North America RIM margin resumed year-over-year expansion in the quarter, as we addressed the cost issues experienced in Q1. Excluding the change in lease accounting, which reduced margins in the segment by about 20 basis points compared to a year ago, EBITDA margin in this segment expanded 30 basis points.","The North America data management margin declines continued to be driven by lower volumes as well as product mix. Revenue management is helping to offset some of the declines that support healthy margins. In Western Europe, Q2 margins contracted 20 basis points, reflecting higher temporary facility costs and professional fees for process improvements.","Some of our recent acquisitions of customer relationships in the region are operating at lower margins until we can fully synergize. Other international margins were up 30 basis points in the quarter, despite the 75 basis points impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, reflecting the increased scale of geographies and continuous improvement initiatives.","In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the second quarter, partly reflecting the acquisition of EvoSwitch and the Netherlands last May, which operates at lower average margins and the impact in churn that occurred in Phoenix in Q1.","As you have seen in our release, we have had an immaterial restatement of our prior period results. During the quarter, we received a notification of assessment from tax and custom authorities in the Netherlands related to value-added taxes on specific business to business customs activity performed by our Bonded business, which we acquired in 2017 and as part of entertainment services. As a result, we have made an immaterial restatement of our prior period financial statements, which can be seen in our 10-Q to be filed later today.","Turning to Slide 9, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio remains in line with other REITs and was flat with Q1. We are on track with our plans to generate $100 million plus of capital recycling proceeds this year from the sale of real estate and we continued to explore options for a JV investment partner for our Frankfurt data center development. And therefore, we expect our leverage ratio decline in the second half of the year.","Also, we\u2019re encouraged by the recent momentum we have seen by the REIT coverage teams at the rating agencies. As we mentioned in Q1, S&P revised our outlook from stable to negative. Similarly, Moody\u2019s revised our outlook to stable in June based on the strength and diversification of our business model with strong cash flows from our core storage business. Our balance sheet remains solid and we continue to invest and grow the business at very attractive returns with low risk.","Turning to outlook, you can find the details and underlying assumptions in the appendix or in our Q2 supplemental. Given these \u2013 given the investments we\u2019ve made to improve efficiencies coupled with the operational improvements implemented in Q2 and additional initiatives underway, adjusted EBITDA should continue to ramp through the back half of the year. AFFO and adjusted EPS guidance ranges have been adjusted to reflect the revised EBITDA guidance and for earnings per share also for higher depreciation.","We\u2019ve also updated our expectations around capital allocation. Given the increase in leasing activity, we now expect data center investments to be about $50 million higher this year, but have reduced our outlook for business acquisitions due to the expected timing of closings of deals in the pipeline. As a result, we are reducing our expectation for M&A capital to $100 million from $150 million previously.","In summary, Q2 reflects healthy and consistent revenue performance from our storage business. While the paper price environment is a headwind, we\u2019ve been taking steps to mitigate its impact on profitability. Our actions to improve margin performance from Q1 levels are evidenced in our results and we are confident in further improvement in the back half. We are excited about the leasing activity and pipeline in our data center business and remain pleased with solid and sustainable revenue growth our teams are delivering.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill for some additional comments before opening up the line for Q&A.","Bill Meaney","Thanks, Stuart. Before we open up the call to your questions, I wanted to take a step back from the quarterly detail and remind you of our long-term business model, which is supported by the durability in the records management business. As an organization, one of the biggest assets we have is extremely deep and long lasting customer relationships, which provide us access to 950 of the Fortune 1000.","These relationships are built on decades of trust and delivering best in class storage and value-added services. Having earned the reputation of trusted guardian of our customers assets allows us to leverage these relationships to identify cross-selling opportunities in drive significant synergies across our growing data center platform, particularly amongst enterprise customers, establishing a private cloud infrastructure and looking for a secure and reliable IT environment.","A second key asset that Iron Mountain possesses is our durable developed markets record management business, which is allowed and will continue to allow us to consistently deliver strong organic cash flow, enabling us to fund future data center growth, scale our emerging markets footprint and invest in innovative solutions to meet our customer\u2019s needs. These two significant assets underpin our overall financial strategy and continued to support and grow our very strong customer relationships.","The resulting sustainability of the core business and growth in the data center business will support our target of achieving consistent 5% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth flowing through to AFFO growth and generate returns above our cost of capital. We will remain very disciplined in our capital allocation decisions, balancing investments that will create value for shareholders, whilst providing more solutions to our customers.","With that operator, please open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. ","Sheila McGrath","Yes, good morning. Bill, at first quarter, you did have some impact from excess labor that impacted margins. It looks like you righted the ship better than your guidance in second quarter. I was just wondering if you could update us on cost optimization initiatives, how they\u2019re progressing and if you have any change in how you expect the margin improvements to play out for the second half of the year.","Bill Meaney","Thanks, Sheila. So yes, we were pleased as you noted that we were above our guidance in terms of sequential EBITDA margin improvement. We\u2019ve updated the guidance by actually tightening the range and what we do, we will see is continuing stepped up of the margin over the course of the year. In other words, there will be a ramp in the second half of the year, but we feel really good about the line of sight that we have to be able to finish up the year in strong shape. ","So the improvements that we made in Q2 more than offset the \u2013 change things structurally that more than offset that missed on the labor in the first quarter. So we feel really good in terms of the setup for the second half, but there will be a ramp.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. And I just wanted your view on the markets not giving you credit clearly right now for the premium dividend yields given where shares are, just your like bigger picture thoughts on either bringing in the capital partner on some of the data centers, so to create liquidity to buy back shares at these levels.","Bill Meaney","Well, I think we\u2019re \u2013 I think you probably appreciate, we\u2019re not going to talk about the buy back on the call. But from a capital allocation standpoint is a board. We look at everything about in terms of where we invest money and how we deploy that and that includes everything from how we give money back to the shareholders whether that\u2019s through a dividend or share buyback. ","So everything is always on the table when we look at it. But I think dividend yields, at some point that your shares become pretty good value. But we\u2019re not \u2013 we looked at the full range of options right now. We really like the capital allocation decisions we have in terms of growing the data center business and also building out our business \u2013 our traditional business in emerging markets in some of our new digital solutions and we\u2019re seeing the growth.","And I\u2019m always the optimist. I feel that at some point our dividend yield reflects probably a lack of appreciation for what we\u2019re doing as a company and eventually gravity does reinsert itself in that, that itself correcting if the share price goes up.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead. ","Nate Crossett","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on that margin improvement question. I think on the last call, you kind of got into 600 basis points ramp by the year end. So I know you said that it\u2019s going to ramp through year end, but is that 600 give or take still in place.","Stuart Brown","Hey Nate, this is Stuart. Yes, if you look at the ramp in the margin that\u2019s implied, I think that the way to look at it, right, if you think about sort of Q2 normalized EBITDA adjusting for the $10 million that we talked about Q2 normalized EBITDA was that $361 million. So guidance of the $1,440 or $1,480 by just backing into what the second half EBITDA growth is and plus in EBITDA growth of 7.65% to 8.05%, but on that range. So that\u2019s a ramp in Q2 normalize about $20 million to $40 million per quarter. ","And you think about even just the first quarter, we improve $35 million from the first quarter. So the ramp and EBITDA margins, you should continue to see and the benefits that we get as we move through the year, we talked about in the last quarter call, right. We\u2019ve got revenue management and most of our pricing takes place in Q2 actually more of it takes place in Q3. So you get the benefit as we move through the year of pricing. And then the continuous improvement initiatives that Bill touched on led by the global operations support team, which really continues to focus on improve labor productivity, particularly in things like Latin America service margin focused on fleet utilization and number of other areas. We\u2019ve got initiatives underway to meet the guidance.","Nate Crossett","Okay, thanks. And then on just the organic growth number, I appreciate your comments on how much customer acquisitions effects that number. And so I just want to be clear that if you take the 2.2% and you subtract 60 basis points, is that 1.6% a true same-store metric by real estate standards or\u2026","Stuart Brown","I don\u2019t think you can compare it to real estate standards, because real estate \u2013 the REIT industry does NOI on a building by building basis, you\u2019ve got to remember the nature of our business is that we store our customers, records and information. They don\u2019t care which building it is. So it\u2019s not a building by building basis, I think about for an office building or a warehouse. So that\u2019s why its organic growth and not sort of the same-store growth. ","Nate Crossett","Okay. And then just one last question on the NoVa lease. I\u2019d be curious to get a little more color on how you won that deal, because some of the other guys have been saying that Northern Virginia is very competitive and there\u2019s pricing pressures. And so I\u2019d just be curious on how you won that. ","Bill Meaney","Yes. I think look, we continued to see our down select ahead of where we have capacity deployed. And I think it\u2019s partly because of the brand, I\u2019d mentioned the cross selling, in fact that we \u2013 the last two quarters been consistent about getting 40% of our lead generation from the other side of the traditional side of the business. And our focus on those customers that are heavily regulated have very high requirements, which is mainly financial services, government and healthcare. ","I mean, not that all our customers are in those categories, but that\u2019s kind of our focus. So we continue, we look at Northern Virginia, I totally take your point. There\u2019s a lot of capacity in Northern Virginia. It is the largest data center market globally. So there\u2019s also a lot of absorption. But that focus I think it\u2019s a lot of to build a pretty good pipeline. We feel really good about the pipeline we have for the Northern Virginia right now. ","Nate Crossett","Okay. Thanks, guys. ","Operator","The next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Eric Luebchow","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the Northern Virginia lease. I know we\u2019ve heard from some of your competitors that pricing and returns have been kind of compressed there. So I\u2019m just curious for some of these larger scale leases, if you\u2019re underwriting kind of a lower return, but longer contract duration or how you kind of look at that balance particularly as you sign these larger scale leases and data centers? ","Bill Meaney","It\u2019s a good question, Eric. So let me ask the question two different ways. So we actually had quite a bit of leasing activity in Northern Virginia in Q2 and we see those at kind of normal rates when I\u2019m talking about the retail sector or retail contracts or leases. On the specific 6 megawatts that is a hyperscale lease. So we\u2019re seeing kind of the 8% to 9% cash on cash returns, which is where we built our business model. So that will, when you start seeing that come through, you\u2019ll see that at a lower rate, but it\u2019s in \u2013 but we think it\u2019s very consistent, not just with Northern Virginia, globally, we expect those kinds of cash on cash returns when we sign up a hyperscale customer. ","You\u2019re obviously getting bigger deployments. So the \u2013 when you actually look at the overall returns \u2013 in the returns on the campus, as we said, I think previously on calls as we think that they maximize or optimize returns on a campus the size of Northern Virginia. We expect to have somewhere between 40% and 50% of the leases in those kind of 8% to 9% cash on cash returns when the site is fully built out and it\u2019s consistent with that. But I would say the pricing on that 6 megawatts is less to do with Northern Virginia to do with the returns that are in the market for those types of customers.","Eric Luebchow","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more for me, given that you took data center development CapEx up $50 million, curious how that impacts your leverage outlook for this year and into next year versus previously. And then could you talk about potentially your ability to recycle more of your industrial real estate portfolio above the $100 million that \u2013 $100 million plus you have in your guidance? ","Stuart Brown","Yes. Thanks, Eric. As we\u2019ve said over the last couple of quarters, we see ourselves landing lease adjusted leverage of around 5.5 times at the end of the year. If you look at sort of how it\u2019s goings to come down from where it was at the end of Q2, right. We\u2019ve benefited really from three things. First of all, the increasing EBITDA year-over-year, right. The leverage is calculated on trailing 12-month basis. Second, the capital recycling underway. We\u2019ve got a sale leaseback portfolio in the market now of industrial properties and a second property, we\u2019re about to start marketing. ","So feel very confident in the $100 million plus that was just built into our guidance currently. We could do more there is a lot of demand out there for industrial real estate. We\u2019re trying to be prudent and sort of prudent the portfolio the right way. The third thing to call out is the data center leasing. Because the way our covenants work in our credit facility as we get credit, because it\u2019s a trailing 12-month basis, on development properties, we get credit for leases that have been signed. So because you\u2019ve put the capital out to develop it upfront, so you get all 12 months of EBITDA credit related to those leases, so that also helps get to the around 5.5 times. ","Eric Luebchow","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Blake Johnson","Good morning. This is Blake on for George. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like organic volume growth in other international was supported by growth in new sales in the quarter. Can you discuss specific storage volume trends that impacted new sales and other international? Are you seeing increasing demand in emerging markets or anything else that would be great?","Bill Meaney","Good morning, Blake. Thanks for that. Yes, I think we \u2013 I think overall, not just I would say in emerging markets, but if we look at our commercial pipeline in our records management business globally is \u2013 it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s very healthy, because obviously that\u2019s what we look for to give with our confidence going forward into the further quarters. ","So just generally, I would say across the globe, we have a pretty good commercial pipeline over the next 12 months to 18 months. Specifically on emerging markets, if we continue to see that, it\u2019s usually in markets like India for instance, where there\u2019s still a very large, what I call on unvended opportunity. I think I might have mentioned previously, there\u2019s a specific customer in India that we just want a part of their business. Historically, it was all in house, there was over 20 million cubic feet. This is a single customer in India. ","So if you think about North America, which is 500 million cubic feet in total, there\u2019s a single customer in India that has over 20 million cubic feet in house. So that just gives you the scale of the type of pipeline at we\u2019re building our line of sight to future demand that we have in some of these markets. So we continue to be quite encouraged by what we\u2019re building.","Blake Johnson","Great. Thank you for that. Also previously you had discussed specific initiatives of the global operations team including transportation cost deficiencies. Can you discuss progress on these initiatives and what your expectations are for the remainder of the year?","Stuart Brown","Yes, Blake, again, it\u2019s built into our guidance. I want to talk about specific results of the initiatives. But yes, we\u2019ve got a number of initiatives going on both to improve efficiency in North America transportation. When we look at our data management business and fleet in the records management business efficiencies on the labor side, particularly focused in Latin America where labor productivity, we think we\u2019ve got some improvements there as we take some of the labor standards that we\u2019ve employed here in North America. ","Some of the efficiencies where just to give you a specific example, in Latin America, we traditionally staffed each project team separately, we\u2019re in North America, we sort of cross train people better and we can use them across projects. We\u2019re putting that same initiative in place in Latin America, which will help Latin America service margins as well. ","So there are a number of things going on. I think we\u2019ve got \u2013 if we total up each initiative from the global operations support team, I mean there\u2019s well worth \u2013 well north of 50 different things that they\u2019re working on to keep taking cost as part of our continuous improvement initiative. I think having a global knowledge is really cross breed ideas of faster and implement them faster across the organization.","Blake Johnson","Great, very helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Steinerman ","Good morning. Looking at Slide 14, bullet one, you raised your organic revenue growth storage range from a quarter ago, it was 1.75% to 2.5% and now it\u2019s 2.2% to 2.8%. What factors give you confidence to take up the range? Maybe what are the most important facts to take up the range? Is it lower destruction, higher revenue management, higher backlog? Just give us a relative sense of what are the most important factors that improved over the last quarter.","Bill Meaney","Andrew, good morning. You almost answered the question for me. It\u2019s pretty much three of your four. So if you think about it, first of all, we\u2019re looking at the commercial pipeline, when we move these ranges. So really liked in terms of the pipeline that the \u2013 and we look at what stage they are in the pipeline in terms of how long we can speak to the customer. So that\u2019s one aspect. ","Destructions are ticked down slightly. So last year I think they were up, destructions were up. So if you look at this year as they trending back to what I would call more normal levels. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re down unusually, but they\u2019ve come down from last year. So that\u2019s the second aspect. And the other thing is, we\u2019re getting, especially in North America, we\u2019re getting more joy from our pricing initiatives that we\u2019ve actually rolled out pricing initiatives to customers where we were a little bit [indiscernible] those seems to be sticking pretty well. So it\u2019s a combination of revenue management, especially \u2013 specifically in North America. And then looking at destruction levels going back to kind of where I will call more norms and then looking ahead at the commercial pipeline.","Andrew Steinerman ","Right. And could you just give a reason why you feel like distractions are normalizing now and what gives us confidence that, that\u2019s going to stick?","Bill Meaney","Well, first of all, these are relatively small movements, but they have sizable impact, right. Because you\u2019re talking about small movements, if you just on a business of 700 million cubic feet. So a little bit of change and that can make big differences. The \u2013 I think last year, we all have our own hypothesis. We speak to customers all the time, but many times of our customers are crisp in their response. But I think last year probably, it was a combination of some of the GDPR cleanup, people were going into bring themselves into compliance and destroying a lot of their documentation rather than trying to bring it into compliance.","And then the other aspect is we did get some legal holes that got released in the financial service industry. So I think those two things alone, probably attracted a bit of it. It\u2019s the best feedback we\u2019re getting from our customers at this point. So our expectations that will kind of trend at the more, what I would call usual levels pre-last year, and you can see that kind of bleeding through this year.","Andrew Steinerman ","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you very much. Can you delve a little bit more into the pricing in North America, you said, I think you described it, Bill, as getting more joy over there. What exactly is it \u2013 are there charges there in put through straight off contracts? Is it something that you feel is, as a sustainable thing that you could do on a regular basis? If you could just give us just a little sense of that.","Bill Meaney","Okay. Good morning, Shlomo. So I think the kind of two aspects, I mean, one is watching the story is about two-thirds of our pricing actions come in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So we have that normal uptick. But specifically and what\u2019s different this year than last year. It is that \u2013 quite frankly, if we started rolling out revenue management, the ones you\u2019re always shy of is your largest customers, right, because there is any elasticity. Obviously, you feel it in volume in larger dimensions. I think the last couple of years have given us confidence as a team and specifically more North America, that we\u2019re able to rollout the same kind of revenue management or pricing discipline to our larger customers as we were to come by midsize customers.","And that was built on a confidence with mid-size customers and as we\u2019ve gone into this year, in the first half of the year, we\u2019ve seen that we have been able to actually achieve that. So lot of this, I think I\u2019ve mentioned before on pricing, a lot of it is change management internally. In other words, giving our folks the confidence that they can charge the right price for the service that we\u2019re delivering.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then if you could just an \u2013 in the supplemental Slide 9, the records management in Developed Markets. So there\u2019s a trend that tend to be going on from like 4Q, where the volumes were declining sequentially. You bucked the trend in 1Q, ticked up and then its down again in 2Q. Why is that trending down even if destruction seem to be moderating. I\u2019m just trying to get a handle as is the trend continuing downwards. Or are we stabilizing? Just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s going on there?","Bill Meaney","Yes, I think it\u2019s more of a stabilized trend. I mean, if you look at the, specifically, on the developed markets, the chart that you\u2019re referring to, is if you\u2019re going to go down into the detail, I\u2019d say, a moderation in terms of new sales in Q2, but if you kind of look at over 12 month basis, that goes up and down. So when we look at that and we look at giving our projections going forward, if we look at the commercial pipeline. So I think it is \u2013 developed markets will be \u2013 as we said, it will be more on the negative side of neutral, so I think, it will be a slight downward tick more than offset by revenue management.","So we built that into our projections and at the end of the day, what we\u2019re delivering is total organic revenue sales, our organic storage sales. We feel really comfortable with that. But in terms of looking at the volume that your question that you\u2019re asking is, we then look forward at the commercial pipeline. We think it\u2019s going to be kind of in that range, it kind of up and down.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. If I could just sneak in last one, that 20 million cubic feet customer in India, when \u2013 is that already rolling in now? What \u2013 when is that supposed to roll in? That sounds like an actually a pretty big deal, for which kind of business.","Bill Meaney","I wish it was the whole 20 million. They\u2019re not outsourcing everything that they have. And they actually split it between two of us. Actually, we got more than half. So we got the bulk of it. So they didn\u2019t outsource the whole 20 million. I think over time they will and that\u2019s already starting to flow into our Indian operation.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Andy Wittmann","Okay, thanks for taking my question guys. Stuart, I appreciated your comments on the acquisition of customer relationships, otherwise known in the industry as the pickup and move business. I guess, as I look at this, I want to understand it a little bit more. I guess, last year you guys spent about $60 million, this year you\u2019re on track for about $90 million for these types of customer relationship acquisitions. You mentioned that, you pay a sales commission anyway, and so there\u2019s costs either way. What is the delta in cost, if you look out on a per box basis or some normalized basis between the two as you compare them. I mean, $90 million this year, I mean, it\u2019s clearly driving growth. You said 60 basis points of volume. But how does that compare? It seems like, it\u2019s more expensive than a sales commission, but why don\u2019t you help us understand that a little bit more?","Stuart Brown","Yes. I think it\u2019s actually not very complicated, right? So on average, we\u2019ve spend, I think probably at $60 million a year and this year, I would expect this to be sort of around that as well. And that includes, mostly boxes, mostly in the developed business and the developed markets. Some of it\u2019s little bit of it in the shred business as well. So it gets sort of spread between the two. And as we said before, typically, we will bring in 3 million to 4 million cubic feet a year in tuck-in. When you\u2019re comparing the cost between, bring it in through a salesperson or you typically get a number of different costs, because when you bring it to salesperson, depending upon if it\u2019s at the customers today or in the competitors, you get some different costs. So you\u2019ve got the sales commissioning you have to pay, but you\u2019re right is a portion of it.","If it\u2019s at a competitor, you\u2019re often reimbursing the customer for their permanent withdrawal fees that they\u2019ve got to pay for the competitor, right, which can be pretty substantial. And so you compare that to a [indiscernible] we are typically paying around three times revenue. You actually don\u2019t get that much of a difference, but you get the volume benefit and efficiency benefits of doing it and moving it one time efficiently. And once you\u2019re fully integrated and synergized, you\u2019re at about a 90% margin, so the flow through that\u2019s really good.","So you\u2019ve got a payback of less than four years with integration costs. Which is giving you a cash on cash return of 25%. So our goal is to be transparent about it. We view it as organic and because it is like a sales or some other competitive takeaway. We provide the information to investors, but it is part of our organic growth and we think about it that way as part of our organic capital spend as well.","Andy Wittmann","Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. So in there, I heard that you\u2019re expecting actually $60 million for customer relationships. So I\u2019m sorry if I misquote you in my question there, where I said its 90. So that implies not the difference between the $90 million, that\u2019s in your $515 million and the $60 million, you mentioned there is the customer inducements, which are basically \u2013 those come out from withdrawal fees. Is that the right way to think about it?","Stuart Brown","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Andy Wittmann","Okay, cool. That\u2019s what I wanted to understand. Thank you for your help.","Operator","The next question comes from Marlane Pereiro from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.","Marlane Pereiro","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a quick question regarding, can you talk about funding the $395 million of incremental capital for investments and getting leverage to around 5.5 times by year end?","Stuart Brown","Yes, I think I touched on this. There\u2019s couple of different ways to look at it. I mean, I\u2019ve touched on the leverage change from year to year end, both from the capital recycling and the thing to remember, Marlene, is that as EBITDA growth, right. That allows you to borrow against that and still reduce leverage. So if our EBITDA growth $100 million organically per year, you can see a radically at five times borrow $500 million and still reduce leverage from where we are at the mid five levels. So you can do both at the same time and fund those capital needs.","Marlane Pereiro","Great. So just to be clear, you do expect as communicated last quarter that you expect leverage to kind of to get down to roughly that 5.5 area.","Stuart Brown","Yes, which is \u2013 I repeated that in my opening remarks as well.","Marlane Pereiro","Yes. Great, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Hello?","Bill Meaney","Yes.","Kevin McVeigh","Can you hear me? Hey, Bill or Stuart. Nice job on the margin sequentials, the paper headwinds weren\u2019t as much as what we had modeled. Can you help us understand what you use and for the spot price kind of where that came in the quarter. And then how we should think about that over the balance of the year?","Stuart Brown","Yes. Kevin. I appreciate the question, because there\u2019s been a number of questions about it. Let me start off with, our initial guidance already assumed that paper prices would be declining. So our initial guidance, we assume that paper prices would decline about $10 per ton from 2018 and on a price per ton basis, $10 per ton equates to about $6 million of EBITDA.","So if you so to say, okay, what\u2019s now inherited our current assumptions and Bill touched on his remarks, I did as well. If paper prices stay at current levels and that\u2019s down about $40 per ton from a year ago, right. That $40 per ton is about $25 million, impact year-over-year, right. And so if you think about it versus guidance, that\u2019s about $20 million headwind relative to our guidance. Other things just for people to remember as well, we have really high quality sorted office papers, when we go into market to sell. We do sell it at a higher price and what people maybe saying in the index.","Kevin McVeigh","That\u2019s helpful. And then just Stuart, what was it that kind of helped the margin recovery? I mean, I know in the first quarter, it was kind of there were some unexpected cost around labor, things like that. What were you able to put in place that kind of help boost the sequential and then the improvement that we\u2019ll see over the balance of the year?","Stuart Brown","Remember, that despite the $10 million of headwinds that we booked as well. And again, we came out of \u2013 we talked about in the first quarter call, we came out with a lot of confidence in terms of our ability to recover, the fact was that the labor issue that we had in first quarter was late in the quarter, we could have recovered in the quarter.","And again, I think from an execution, from our operations teams out there around the world, now the ones who really get the credit, both Bill touched on the revenue management of programs we\u2019ve got in place, cost takeout, there\u2019s a lot of work we have to do, right. There\u2019s a lot of opportunities for us in terms of levers in the company to move margins and to get more efficient and we work on delivering those every day.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. But was that maybe, I guess, can you give us some examples was it like maybe lower bonuses to drivers or was it just any thoughts on kind of\u2026","Stuart Brown","Absolutely not. We\u2019re not taking this out of the backs of our \u2013 of the mountain here is out there who are serving our customers every day. If you look, you can see labor efficiencies, our labor actually year-over-year as a percentage of revenue is down. There is some price flow through, again most of them come through in the back half of the year. And then efficiencies and just other costs of sales as well around transportation in some of the other areas.","Kevin McVeigh","Got to, okay. Thank you.

We are pleased to report a strong finish to 2017, characterized by significant progress against our 2020 strategic plan, with solid momentum in the business and durable internal storage revenue growth clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. Moreover, the acquisition of IO Data Centers coupled with Fortrust earlier in the year, provides us with the platform that will not only deliver our 2020 goals for Adjacent Business growth, but also drive higher and sustainable growth.","As shown on Slide 3, we are well on track to having a business mix that will structurally deliver north of 5% EBITDA growth before acquisitions, up from about 3.5% as of the end of 2017.","Turning to Slide 4. Full year revenue growth of 9% was slightly above our expectations. And adjusted EBITDA was in line with our outlook, up 16% over 2016, driven by strong internal growth, Recall synergies, transformation and a full year of contribution from Recall. This strong performance represents a 180 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins over 2016 and 220 basis points of improvement over the past two years despite the integration of Recall, which had historically lower margins than stand-alone Iron Mountain.","In addition, AFFO for the full year was up more than 12%. Our strong 2017 performance benefited from favorable currency translation after three years of FX headwinds. For the fourth quarter, our results reflected continued strong internal storage rental revenue growth across the business. We achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% in Q4, whilst internal service revenue growth was essentially flat, as expected, at minus 0.1%.","In total, internal revenue growth was 2.5%, our strongest performance in the last 12 quarters. This healthy growth was supported by ongoing revenue management progress, primarily in North America, and continued worldwide net volume growth prior to the inclusion of acquisitions.","We continued to generate positive net volume with seven million cubic feet globally before acquisitions over the past 12 months. This supports the durability of storage growth. And importantly, every one of these boxes is effectively in annuity for the next 15 years as new records stay with us on average for that length of time. We also made significant progress on the execution of our strategic plan. ","As you will recall, our plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued nurturing of our core developed markets, expanding into faster-growing emerging markets and growing our storage-related Adjacent Businesses such as art and entertainment services as well as data centers. We are doing this whilst capturing new service opportunities to provide innovative solutions to new and existing customers. ","We have a robust outlook for 2018, reflecting continued successful execution against our 2020 strategic plan, and Stuart will have more details shortly. Slide 5 is a review of highlights related to our strategic plan. In developed markets, which include both our North American RIM and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 3.4%, with modestly positive internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis.","As noted last quarter, internal storage revenue growth in North America and increasingly, in Western Europe, is driven by revenue management rather than by organic volume growth. It is important to note that whilst our successful revenue management efforts may marginally impact the incoming volume from existing customers, it has not significantly impacted new customer behavior nor has it caused an increase in customer terminations or destructions. ","Given our successful implementation in North America, we plan to add revenue management resources to Western Europe and Asia, Latin America, Australia and Eastern Europe during 2018. Furthermore, we will continue to seek growth from existing customers through revenue management programs and sales of services, and we will focus on volume growth from further penetration of unvended customers such as those in the mid-market in the U.S. federal government segments.","An example of the potential from the U.S. federal government can be seen from our press release last week reporting that we secured a records management win with the U.S. federal prison system. It can sometimes take 12 months or more to inbound records from the federal segment, therefore, this volume as well as that from the U.S. Patent Office awarded late last year are not yet reflected in our reported volume.","Looking at our goal to expand to the faster-growing emerging markets, they now represent more than 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, almost double the relative size from about four years ago. Our progress against this goal was supported by emerging market acquisitions closed during the year totaling more than $87 million, which we purchased at a weighted average multiple of seven times stabilized EBITDA.","Notable among emerging market deals in 2017 were: acquisition of the remaining portions of Santa Fe in South Korea, the Philippines and China; our entry into the Middle East; transactions in Peru, in Cyprus; a small shredding business in South Africa purchased from Stericycle; and a transaction in India that moved us into the market-leading position. ","We continue to have a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities in emerging markets and are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making to deepen our presence in key growth markets that continue to experience strong, high-single digit internal storage growth. ","Given our acquisition of IO Data Centers, we have begun breaking out our data center business as a separate reporting segment. Note that IO closed in January, so it is not reflected in our reported figures for Q4 or 2017. In addition, we have removed entertainment services from our North American Data Management segment and combined it with art storage as the nature of the storage assets and customer bases for these two businesses are more similar. ","With the acquisition of Bonded Services in Q4, we expect to see improved synergies in the entertainment services business. The quarterly data for 2017, consistent with the new segmentation, can be found in the appendix to the supplemental. ","Turning to Slide 6 in our data center business, we took a major transformative step towards shifting our business mix to faster-growing segments with our acquisition of IO for approximately $1.3 billion which closed in January. IO Data Centers substantially extends our existing data center platform and provides expansion capacity in the high-growth, high-absorption market of Phoenix as well as the strategically important market of New Jersey. ","Phoenix is a very attractive market where co-location and cloud providers have made significant investments over the past few years. It has diverse energy sources and relatively inexpensive green power as well as attractive business environment and was the fourth highest U.S. market in absorption last year. New Jersey also is a critical market for our data center portfolio given the importance of the New York metro area to our global financial services customers. ","The IO purchase represented a 15 times EBITDA multiple on a post-integration basis, including synergies of about $9 million. This multiple compares favorably to recent public and private market transactions, many of which do not provide the same growth outlook. ","IO\u2019s high-margin business is poised for significant growth, including partial synergies, and importantly, 95% of the forecasted EBITDA is already contracted. The IO deal follows our acquisition of Fortrust and the opening of our greenfield expansion into Northern Virginia in September. In addition, we plan to close on the purchase of two Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore in the first quarter. ","In aggregate, we expect these data center acquisitions to be modestly accretive to AFFO in 2019, including the impact of shares issued to finance the IO deal and ATM issuances for the Credit Suisse transaction. For 2018, we expect the data center business to generate approximately $200 million in revenue and $100 million in normalized EBITDA. ","We believe these acquisitions will create real value for shareholders given the growth characteristics of the data center space, the specific markets we\u2019ve entered, additional development capacity and the uniqueness of Iron Mountain\u2019s brand and customer portfolio. Including these three transactions in our organic base, including Northern Virginia and the underground data centers in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our existing data center operations span 90-plus megawatts with expansion capacity of an additional 160 megawatts, bringing our total potential platform to more than 250 megawatts.","Stuart will have more detail on the financial impact of our 2018 guidance and 2020 plan from the accelerated growth in our data center business in a few minutes.","On Slide 7, I want to reiterate that following the issuance of debt and equity to finance the IO transaction, we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets for 2020, which assumes a 4% annual increase in dividends per share, as shown in this depiction of our financial model. ","Stuart will address our balance sheet shortly, but I\u2019d like to briefly note that whilst we\u2019re disappointed with the market selloff of REITs in anticipation of increasing interest rates, it is important to recognize that those rate hikes are generally associated with inflationary pressure. Unlike many REITs, we have the ability to pass through inflation-based rental rate increases on an annual basis, and we see meaningful flow-through on those increases given the high-margin characteristics of our storage business. ","In a nutshell, given our 75% storage gross margin, coupled with the ability to increase pricing in line with inflation, higher inflationary environments generally expand our margins and accelerate our cash generation well ahead of inflation. In a word, inflation helps us further helps us further outperform as a business, which is pretty unique in the world of income-oriented stocks.","To wrap up, we had a very eventful year with solid fundamental results from storage revenue underpinning our progress in driving improved profitability, whilst at the same time laying the foundation for sustained and accelerated growth through expansion of our faster-growing portfolio of data centers, Emerging Markets and Adjacent Businesses. ","Our progress drives growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share and delever over time. In fact, Iron Mountain is unique amongst top-yielding S&P 500 companies and that we continue to demonstrate strong internal revenue growth with attractive long-term growth potential. ","We are encouraged by the tremendous progress made in 2017 and our momentum moving into 2018, and we will continue to be disciplined about deploying capital to accelerate growth in a manner that is consistent with our financial framework. ","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Stuart. ","Stuart Brown","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re excited to deliver another strong quarter and year of robust storage rental growth and enhanced margins, reflecting the strength of our global position and the discipline of our management teams. We remain steadily on track to deliver on our financial and strategic goals, anchored with a disciplined investment strategy oriented toward faster-growing, value-creating businesses. ","On today\u2019s call, I will review our 2017 full year performance compared to expectations and cover the fourth quarter\u2019s operational and financial drivers. Then I will lay out our expectations for 2018 with an update on our 2020 plan, considering also the recent data center acquisitions. ","Turning to our full year performance on Slide 8 of the presentation. Results were generally in line with our guidance discussed on last quarter\u2019s call. Revenue came in at $3.8 billion and just above the range as a result of strong internal storage revenue growth, driven by our revenue management efforts as well as currency translation benefits. ","Adjusted EBITDA of $1.26 billion was in the middle of our range. Compared to the full year 2016, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 180 basis to 32.8%, with higher gross margins and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenues.","Our structural tax rate for the year was slightly lower than we had guided on the Q3 call due to the mix in North America taxable income between the Q1 and taxable entities. AFFO came in at the higher end of our range due to efficiencies in capital maintenance projects following the acquisition of Recall, as discussed last quarter. ","Let\u2019s now turn to our results for the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 9, it shows our key financial metrics, our fourth quarter total revenues grew 6.1% over last year or 4.1% on a constant-dollar basis. Internal storage rental revenue increased a strong 4.2% in the quarter, while internal service revenue declined 0.1% as we cycled against a large entertainment services project a year ago. ","Our gross profit margin improved by 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by synergies from the Recall acquisition reducing labor expenses and the flow-through of our revenue management program. Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter increased over 10% to almost $327 million, leveraging growth of approximately 8% on a constant-dollar basis. ","And EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points to 32.9% as we leverage labor and facility costs. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share, inclusive of a $0.02 per share increase in amortization expense, reflecting a catch-up associated with an adjustment to the life of Recall\u2019s customer relationship value. Adjusted EPS would have been $0.31 per share excluding this catch-up. ","AFFO was $154 million in the fourth quarter, in line with the expectations discussed in our last call, but down year-over-year due to timing of capital expenditures and cash expenses. Maintenance and non-real estate investments increased $28 million compared to a year ago as the costs were more back-end weighted this year, as we have previously indicated. On cash taxes, there was a swing of $14 million compared to a year ago.","Turning to Slide 10 in internal growth performance for the quarter. We are very pleased with the momentum in internal storage growth, which resulted from strong revenue management efforts as records volume held flat in developed markets and continued growing in emerging markets where we're shifting more of our mix. Almost half of our total revenue comes from the developed markets storage business, which had 3.4% internal growth.","On a trailing 12-month basis, records volume growth was modestly positive on the base of over 500 million cubic feet in storage. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 0.1% due to continued growth in our shred business and other project-based revenue, slightly offset by lower average prices for recycled paper.","In Other International, we continue to see storage internal revenue growth of 6.8%. Service internal revenue growth in the segment was flat as we continue to cycle over a high level of Recall destruction projects a year ago. In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the legacy data center business saw strong internal revenue growth slightly north of 20%, which excludes our recent acquisitions. Internal service revenue growth in Corporate and Other was down year-over-year due to the lapping of the project in entertainment services business.","Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter expanded in North America records management and Western Europe compared to a year ago as we continue to benefit from the flow-through of our revenue management programs and realize the benefits from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative. In North America Data Management, adjusted EBITDA margins were down slightly year-over-year as we continue to invest in more new product development than a year ago.","As a reminder, this segment has been restated and no longer includes our entertainment services business, which is more skewed towards a service than storage. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins improved as we continue to scale the business. Over the long-term, we closer to a mid to high 50% range as we integrate the IO acquisition and continue to scale.","Before I cover guidance for 2018, let me briefly turn to our balance sheet. We continued our successful refinancing efforts in the fourth quarter with a GBP400 bond offering resulting in our having over 80% of our debt at fixed rates and a reduction in our weighted average interest rate to 5% at year-end. In addition, these efforts extended our average maturity to 6.8 years with a well-laddered maturity schedule.","As of the end of the fourth quarter, our lease-adjusted leverage ratio was 5x, helped by the December capital raising associated with the IO Data Center acquisition, which closed in January of this year. We expect our leverage ratio to be closer to the mid-5x EBITDAR for the first quarter and remain there for most of the year, and then decline as we begin recognizing growing cash flows from data centers, acquisition synergies and lease-up. We remain on track with our plan to reduce our lease-adjusted leverage to about 5x by 2020, as I will discuss in a moment.","Let's turn to expectations underpinning our guidance for 2018 summarized on Page 12 of the results presentation. Please note that our guidance is on a constant-dollar basis and based on January 2018 exchange rates. In addition, it reflects the impact of the new revenue recognition standard we adopted effective January 1, 2018. This guidance is very much in line with long-term expectations and reflects our growing data center platform. At the midpoint and on a constant-currency basis, we expect total revenues to grow by 8%, adjusted EBITDA by 14% and AFFO to grow by 9% in 2018 compared with 2017.","2018 total revenue growth will be driven by internal storage revenue growth, which is expected to be between 3% and 3.5%, reflecting ongoing revenue management efforts in developed markets and volume growth in emerging markets. For the first quarter, remember that North America will be lapping a prior year period that had a significant amount of new customer activity.","As a result, developed markets' trailing 12-month internal volume growth reporting in Q1 2018 is expected to decline up to 50 basis points and then improve as we move through the year. For the full year, we expect to see positive internal volume growth in Western Europe, while we anticipate lower income and volume from existing customers in North America, leading to a slight volume decline overall in developed markets.","As a result, net internal volume growth in developed markets is expected to be flat to down 25 basis points in 2018 on a base of over 500 million cubic feet. However, as mentioned, revenue management and emerging markets revenue growth are projected to deliver total storage rental revenue growth of 3% to 3.5%. Our internal revenue guidance does not include the data center business recently acquired as these would be in operation for less than a year and wouldn't be a part of our internal growth calculations for 2018.","The data center revenue is expected to be approximately $200 million with leasing approaching 10 megawatts, but not all will take occupancy in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to accelerate with the expansion of our data center business as well as margin expansion from the continued realization of savings related to the Recall acquisition, our continuous improvement initiatives and ongoing revenue management initiatives.","In addition, our adjusted EBITDA will benefit from the new revenue recognition standard by about $25 million to $30 million due to the capitalization of commissions and initial intake costs. Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted EBITDA growth would be approximately 12% at the midpoint, and adjusted EBITDA margin will increase 120 basis points from 2017.","Our structural tax rate is expected to be between 18% to 20% in 2018, reflecting lower rates in the U.S. taxable lease subsidiary, offsetting continued growth in our international businesses. Interest expense is expected to be between $415 million to $425 million, while our average share count is expected to be around 287 million shares in 2018, reflecting the financing of the IO Data Center acquisition.","Adjusted EPS for 2018 reflects the increased depreciation and amortization and interest expense from recent data center acquisitions. There is no material benefit to adjusted EPS from the new revenue recognition standard as the cost capitalization will be largely offset by amortization related to these expenses. AFFO growth reflects the strength and durability of our storage business.","We expect growth of 9% to the midpoint of guidance, with maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments of approximately $155 million to $165 million next year, together representing roughly 4% of revenue consistent with 2017. Also, we don't add back the amortization related to commissions to calculate AFFO, so the new revenue recognition standard has no material impact.","Let me turn to our capital investment expectations. As always, we remain focused on expanding shareholder value through prudent capital deployment where we can achieve returns in excess of our hurdle rate. For 2018, we continue to expect to spend $150 million on core M&A transactions as well as $100 million to acquire the two Credit Suisse data centers. The bulk of the core activity is expected to be in higher-growth emerging markets, consistent with our 2020 plan.","In addition, we expect to invest $185 million on data center development, including data halls in Northern Virginia and expansion in Phoenix, which will come online and generate storage revenue beyond 2018 with stabilized double-digit NOI yields. We expect to fund these growth investments through a combination of cash from operations, debt, capital recycling from the sale of real estate as well as potential ATM issuances, particularly to fund the Credit Suisse data center acquisition.","Lastly, our cash available for distribution, or CAD, continues to fund our dividend as well as maintenance and core growth investments, as you can see on Slide 13 of the presentation. With our recent expansion in the data center business, we have updated our 2020 plan that we've previously laid out on Investor Day. As you can see on Slide 14, on a compounded annual growth rate basis, we anticipate revenue to grow by almost 7% from 2017 to 2020; adjusted EBITDA to grow by 11%; and AFFO to grow over 11% or over 7% on a per share basis.","With expectations of a dividend per share growth around 4%, as Bill discussed, we expect an AFFO payout ratio in the mid-70s and our leverage ratio to be around 5x in 2020. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in 2017, which continues to be underscored by the strength and durability of our storage rental business. Our core business fuels the cash flow growth, thereby funding investment to continue growth and enhance returns to shareholders. We're excited to accelerate our growth as we expand in the data center space and confident in the value we'll create for shareholders over time by the platform we've built. We remain well-positioned to deliver on our near and long-term financial projections.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open it up for Q&A.","Bill Meaney","Thank you, Stuart. Just a few points. We continue to drive improved internal storage revenue growth across both developed and emerging markets. The recent expansion of our data center business through the acquisition of IO and Fortrust and the expected acquisition of Credit Suisse data centers will take our organic EBITDA growth from 3.5% in Q4 to over 5% in 2020. We have done all this whilst remaining committed to our financial framework and targets. Net of all this, we continue to be a standout in the S&P with a strong dividend plus robust and sustainable growth.","With that, I would like to hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","I was just \u2013 first, I had a question on guidance, if you could give us a little bit more color. Now owning more data centers, will this mean higher CapEx and straight-lining adjustments to get to AFFO?","Stuart Brown","Yes, it will mean \u2013 well, most of the CapEx that we'll be having initially will really be building out the development pipeline, right? We're really going from a pretty small development pipeline, but the growth opportunities that we have in Denver, in Arizona, in New Jersey as well as the Virginia campus, we'll continue to build the development pipeline. With that comes, from a GAAP standpoint, obviously, capitalized expenses and capitalized interest. And then as the leases grow, we will be straight-lining rent adjustment coming into AFFO.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. And a follow-up. Could you give us an update on how leasing is going at some of the data center projects and some insight on the IO transaction and integration?","Bill Meaney","Yes, it's a good question. We're really pleased by \u2013 I guess, we expected an acceleration in terms of the pipeline, in terms of new sales, but I think getting the new logos, so to speak, from IO, which are also existing customers for Iron Mountain both, some on the data center side, but a number of them in our data management or our records side, has really accelerated the conversation both for us, but also for the IO sales force. So we're really encouraged. It's obviously early days, but the feedback that I've been getting from the sales teams is they've already seen an increase in activity, an increase in interest in what we're offering.","Stuart Brown","In Northern Virginia, the first data hall we built out is about two-thirds leased already, and that's why we've got in our plans to go and build up the next two data halls. We've seen a lot of interest, the potential pipeline as a multiple of what we've got in our expectations for next year for lease-up. So we're pretty confident in the 10 megawatts that we've got in the guidance for next year.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hey, good morning. Just two, just on the volume decline in 2018, it sounds like there's some kind of mathematical calculation risk over there. Can you just explain why particularly the volumes to decline?","Bill Meaney","Hi, Shlomo, good morning. Yes. By the way, your \u2013 I got the question, but your phone is breaking up. But anyway, there's a couple of things going on. One of the things, as Stuart pointed out, is that we're lapping a strong comparable in Q1 of last year because of some new customer activity. But overall, it's the same trend that we called out last time is that if you look at incoming volume from existing customers in North America versus Western Europe, Western Europe, we're still seeing kind of, what I'd say, steady incoming percentage growth from existing customers, where we've seen a reduction in North America.","Now some of that may be because we're being a bit more aggressive in terms of revenue management which, obviously, we rolled out a couple of years before we start rolling it out in Western Europe. That being said, we don't see an increase in destruction rate, and we don't \u2013 and we actually see a slight uptick in terms of new customers as we kind of focus on unvended, mid-market and federal government.","So we expect that trend to continue. I mean, there is a little bit of an overlap of a high comparable in Q1. But as Stuart said, we think, overall, our developed markets will be flat to minus 0.25 basis point. And we expect those \u2013 that kind of trend to continue, and it's mainly driven by a slowdown of incoming volume from \u2013 still growing, but a slowdown of incoming volume from existing customers in North America. And I think, going forward, we will continue to optimize price for existing customers and continue to seek new volume more and more from unvended opportunities.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Just to understand this better, if I were to look in 2019 \u2013 to be roughly flat or I guess [indiscernible] volumes start to decline?","Bill Meaney","No. Well, I think it will be roughly \u2013 if you look at developed markets, it will be roughly flat. I mean, I think you're still going to be, from a volume \u2013 don't forget, this is on 500 million cube, and so I think volume, if you look at developed markets, are probably continuing to hover in kind of the flat, plus or minus, let's say, 0.25 basis point, so maybe negative, maybe flat, maybe slightly up. But we continue to feel that we're not going for share in these markets. And so we think the right thing to do is to make sure that we're using revenue management appropriately, so we're not trying to increase the amount of growth from existing customers.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And just, Stuart, can you walk us through some of the assumptions beyond 2018 to get us to 2020, how are you going to delever to 5x and get AFFO coverage down to 70% to 75% if you're going to be continuing to invest in data center and build out these data center assets? Is there some kind of big step-up in margin that we should be expecting that are going to improve the leverage ratio? Just can you give us some of the pieces of the puzzle that we need to build a model that will help us understand this?","Stuart Brown","Shlomo, let me start with the \u2013 I mean, the target of \u2013 for leverage and \u2013 for our leverage framework is really built around two things: a, optimizing our cost of capital; and b, making sure that we've got capacity in our balance sheet to be able to take advantage of opportunities. There's no liquidity issue where we're sitting today from a leverage standpoint. So as we want to delever over time, it's more about getting back to creating that capacity for us to take advantage of dislocations.","So with that said, we said when we purchased IO that we will be taking a step-up in leverage related to that and that will delever naturally over time with organic growth. However, we will be putting capital back to work in development as well. And so the funding of that additional development as we kind of build our data center pipeline like other data center REITs, how are we going to fund that? We will get some cash flow from operations. We will use the ATM for things like Credit Suisse, and we're looking at capital recycling opportunities.","And we've been \u2013 just to give you an example of one we've got right now is we've recently purchased a property in the Midlands outside of London. And we're going to sell some fairly high-value properties that are in \u2013 much closer into the city, I think it's three properties, as we move out to the Midlands over the next couple of years.","So those are the types of opportunities where we can sell those types of properties through a short-term leaseback and then move back and move out to cheaper properties as records management becomes more archival so that we've got a number of levers that we can pull to fund the data center expansion. And if you look at the model that we provided on 2020, coming back to your payout ratio question, right, we're not going to \u2013 we don't anticipate the dividend to grow as fast as AFFO. And so again, you get a natural reduction of the payout ratio down into the mid-70s.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, and I'll work with that. And then can you give me \u2013 give us, on the acquisition \u2013 excuse me, when you're saying the data center is expected to provide $200 million of revenue, $100 million of normalized EBITDA in 2018, what are you normalizing for?","Stuart Brown","So the only thing that's normalized for in that number is the integration costs related to IO, and that's $4 million to $5 million. That $4 million to $5 million is built into our total EBITDA guidance, but we normalize for that when you look straight at just the data center number.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPM.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. When looking at the current status of the 2020 plan on Slide 14, one of the underlying assumptions there is to achieve the $2.54 dividend per share goal is a higher margin assumption. The implied margin for 2020 is now 36.8%. Previously, it was 35.6%. What gives your team confidence in higher 2020 margins than previously thought?","Bill Meaney","So let me kind of give you the high-level view of it, Andrew, and then I'll let Stuart comment more. But the part that's really given us the confidence is the traction that we've gotten on the revenue management side of the storage business. You can see that in terms of the margin expansion that we've gotten in the last 12 months because what we're doing right now is we still think we'll be able to maintain 3% to 3.5% internal revenue growth on the storage side, and we're doing that at the same time whilst minimizing the amount of racking and boxes that we have to put in place to take the boxes because we're relying more and more on price. So we feel really good about \u2013 and we already see that. We've seen an acceleration in our margin increase. But I mean, Stuart, you may want to comment more in terms of our specific margin target.","Stuart Brown","Just two other quick things I'll point out, right, we're coming in, in a little bit of a higher base, right? We've outperformed expectations in 2017. The other thing, Andrew, don't forget, is the revenue recognition accounting change has an impact on that margin as well, so you need to normalize for that.","Andrew Steinerman","Right. So just to say, cleanly, the success of 2017, revenue recognition, but it's not like you're saying I'm going to have higher synergies than previously thought on Recall or higher transformational initiatives.","Bill Meaney","No, no. It's really driven by the gross margin on the business.","Andrew Steinerman","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","Hi, good morning. Just a couple more questions on guidance. What are the expectations on the service side for revenue growth and margins in 2018?","Stuart Brown","Revenue growth on the service side is expected to be flat. It will be a little bit better than we've had in the past really because of the shred business. We see stronger growth on the shred side.","Karin Ford","Okay. And do you expect steady margins based on that?","Bill Meaney","Well, I think, actually, if you look at it, Karin, if you look at historically over the last three years, we're really pleased in the progress that we've made both on the storage margin but also as well as just in terms of storage growth. You can start seeing through \u2013 you see that we have positive internal storage rate of growth both for developed markets and emerging markets. And that's really how \u2013 as we've been replacing with historically with the bedrock, which was the transportation, with some of the new service offerings, so we feel really good with the progress and the momentum that we're building there.","Karin Ford","Great. Next question is, you mentioned you're going to be rolling out revenue management into the emerging markets in 2018. How much do you think that could boost organic revenue growth in the emerging markets?","Bill Meaney","We're not \u2013 we're going to stay within our overall guidance that Stuart laid out, the 3% and 3.5% overall. I mean, we'll give you more flavor as we go forward. You could see a little bit of the impact this past quarter, but we're still focused in those markets. Think about those markets, a lot of them were still focused on getting to a market-leading position. And when you're in a market-leading position, obviously, volume is your primary lever that you're looking at. And then at some point, you start harvesting that volume and optimize it with revenue management.","So we are introducing because we think there are some \u2013 there is some low-hanging fruit in some of those markets. But I think our first quarter call, sort of speaking, that we are applying some of the tools now in emerging markets is Western Europe because we think there's a lot more that can be done if you just look at that Western Europe, we're still relying on volume growth more than revenue growth in terms of \u2013 I mean, volume growth more than revenue management to get to the revenue growth in that market. And we think we can optimize that further as we look at being efficient capital allocators.","Karin Ford","Okay, thanks. I know I've asked you this question on calls past. But now that the tax law is settled, did you guys review whether or not you want to maintain your REIT status? And did you consider de-REIT-ing?","Bill Meaney","I'll start, and then Stuart could give you the technical answer. Yes, I mean, of course, we look at these things, but it's not even close, right? I mean, if you think about us as an income-oriented stock, we're kind of unique. We have a high yield and we have strong growth going forward. And we're attractive to income-oriented investors, whether they are REITs or C-Corp type investors. And given the nature of our business where we generate a lot of cash, the REIT framework is still an efficient way for us to give benefits to our shareholders, and we drive our \u2013 most of our revenue from real estate in terms of the storage nature of the business. And the fact that tax rates have come down, it just means they're paying less tax on the service side of the business. So \u2013 but I mean, Stuart, you may want to comment.","Stuart Brown","The other thing I'll add is on the data center side, I mean, the main reason we're expanding the data centers relationship we have with our customers and our ability to create value, the ability to leverage the REIT status on that is clearly helpful as well, right? So if you're Credit Suisse of the world, you're not getting the tax shield that we can provide as a REIT on those things. So a lot of data centers that are on the balance sheet of C-Corps are actually better in place than a balance sheet of a REIT. So we'll continue to leverage that as well.","Karin Ford","Great. Last one from me. In past cycles, have you seen demand increase when GDP growth goes above 3%? And what type of economic forecast have you baked in the guidance?","Bill Meaney","Yes. We haven\u2019t \u2013 if we look at the guidance, right, what we've baked in is a little bit of inflation because probably, in the near term, I think the biggest benefit for us is \u2013 it's kind of like a rain dance, I pray for inflation every day I come to work because inflation, our top line is really driven by inflation. And GDP, for sure, I think if you've been following the company a long time, my predecessor had shown a number of graphs where GDP does drive volume growth. But I think given the amount of growth that we expect in \u2013 the change in growth of GDP over the next 8, 12 or 24 months, I think that's going to be less of a driver than the change of inflation. And of course, with a 75% gross margin storage business, every point of inflation expands our margins.","So you were kind of unique in that sense. So I know that a lot of income-oriented companies don't like inflation because it's hard to keep dividend growth at pace with inflation. In our case, it's just the opposite. It allows \u2013 the more inflation allows us even to outperform with our dividend. So it's \u2013 so I think in the near term, I'm doing my inflation dance.","Karin Ford","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Yes. Any update, insight how we should think about Recall and transformation impact in 2018?","Bill Meaney","It's mostly \u2013 I mean, Stuart, you may want to give more, but it's mostly done at this point. I mean, there's still a little bit \u2013 we always said that we think there's more to get done on some of the integration in terms of integrating facilities in real estate, and we're still picking through that. But I would say the bulk of it, I mean, Stuart.","Stuart Brown","Yes, the bulk of it is done in terms of the Recall investments. We do still have some back-office systems and some IT Recall costs as well, as well as the real estate that Bill mentioned. And the synergies will continue to sort of flow through as we ramp up. It's built into the guidance numbers, and we're right on track.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. And then just on G&A, that was a little higher than we had forecast in fourth quarter. I wonder if you can provide any detail on that and how we should think about this line item going forward.","Bill Meaney","If you look at \u2013 what I would look at, Sheila, because there's puts and takes, there is a seasonality aspect in terms of certain things that happened at the end of the year. If you look at year-on-year, you're right, Q3 to Q4 were flat. But if you look at year-on-year, we saw a nice improvement. There was some noise in the end of the quarter that we had some VAT issues that we're still working through, for instance, in India.","But I think if you look at year-on-year, we continue to see that we'll continue to slowly tick down. I mean, in fairness, we've got most of the SG&A improvement, and we baked a little bit into our guidance for 2018. But a lot of what you see between the flattening out between Q3 and Q4 is in the year. But year-on-year, we're pretty happy.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, that's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Iron Mountain sales force and cross-selling all of Iron Mountain. Are you restructuring incentives or anything to encourage the sales force to sell the new and expanded data center segment? Or is this segment going to rely mostly on the data center specific sales force?","Bill Meaney","No, it's a great question. That's one of the things that really excites us about the data center space. I think as we might have mentioned back in December that 65% of our sales \u2013 of our customers right now in our data centers are Iron Mountain ones. And then with IO, there's about a 45% overlap. And even in the short time that we've owned it is we see that the inquiries coming through our data management especially and, to a certain degree, our records management folks has been increasing.","So \u2013 and how we coordinate that, there's always been a pretty good coordination, but we coordinate it with both art and science. So the art is fixed. So I'll give you an example. The Credit Suisse data centers came through our records management sales force in Europe that have been the relationship manager with Credit Suisse for a number of years, not even the data management folks just because of the strong relationship we have with Credit Suisse. And that we use both spiffs, and we also have some of those people actually carry a quota with a \u2013 which is the science part of it.","But that's one of the reasons why we're really excited. And as I say, 950 of the Fortune 1000 are our customers, and over 35,000 data centers just in North America alone are people in and out of almost on a weekly basis. So it is starting to show real benefits.","Stuart Brown","Just to add one quick point onto that as well, just to give you a little bit of color. I mean, our data center team, even district commercials and our the data center team met the first day that IO closed at IO's facility, right, we got the entire commercial team together. And one of the reasons they're excited to be a part of Iron Mountain is now they've got a much bigger platform to be able to sell. And companies have been owned by private equity, right, or don't have the sort of the balance sheet to be able to provide the capacity for these sales teams to be able to provide the customers. So they've got a great roster of customers and a lot of potential transactions in the pipeline. And I guess I should probably welcome them all to the Iron Mountain team.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thank you. Hey. Really nice job on the internal storage growth, the 4.2% in Q4. That kind of took the full year up to 3.9% versus a range of 3% to 3.5%. Was there anything in there in terms of one-time like a termination fee or anything like that? Or was that just kind of the pure price kind of versus making the volume growth algorithm?","Stuart Brown","The only unusual item that was in there for the year was that \u2013 which we have it in the second quarter, and we fully talked about the SimpliVity on an annual basis, we had the SimpliVity termination fee back in the data center. And so that impacted the storage rental growth about 20 basis points for the quarter. But other than that, it's just strong underlying performance, 20 basis points for the year.","Kevin McVeigh","Great.","Stuart Brown","Yes.","Kevin McVeigh","For the full year. So the 3.9%, Stuart, would have been 3.7%, right, x that?","Stuart Brown","Correct.","Kevin McVeigh","Is that the way to think about it?","Stuart Brown","Yes.","Kevin McVeigh","Super. And just as you folks think about kind of price in kind of the revenue management versus the volume in the emerging markets in 2018, to get to that 3% to 3.5% range, is there any way to bracket how much is kind of revenue management versus emerging market unit volume growth, just to try to get a tighter range on what would be 3% versus 3.5%?","Stuart Brown","No, I mean, we gave you the guidance at the top level. If you look at the momentum that we built in the business between revenue management and volume growth in terms of how that's driving the 3% and 3.5%, it's pretty clear. And if you look at the emerging markets, you can see a slight upward trending, but I would instead continue on those trend lines. Effectively, what we're calling out is a similar \u2013 we expect a similar momentum or continued momentum and similar trend in the businesses.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And then just last one from me, if I could. The rev rec, the $7 million of revenue and the $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA, does that sit in storage or service? And would that be considered part of that internal growth, the $7 million of revenue? Or is that not impacted at all?","Stuart Brown","It was mostly \u2013 really mostly in service because it's the commission side, right, that's getting capitalized on EBITDA.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And Stuart, that impacts the internal growth in terms of the revenue or no?","Stuart Brown","No, no, we will exclude definitely internal growth.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay, awesome. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you for squeezing me back in. Stuart, can you give us just a little bit more detail on what your expectations were for data center in 2018 organically versus how much of the data center $200 million revenue, $100 million EBITDA, is acquisition? I know the vast majority of it is, but can you give us a little more specificity?","Stuart Brown","Yes. On the revenue side, I think the ongoing legacy business was about \u2013 I kind of remember off the top of my head, but \u2013 about $30 million \u2013 from the legacy business, about $30 million, and then you had the Fortrust acquisition and then IO on top of it from a revenue standpoint. And then from the IO transaction, we talked about it, with the equity offering, that, that will be, from an EBITDA perspective, around $80 million after integration.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So when I think about it, should I be expecting, including the other acquisitions like Credit Suisse and everything, more like $90 million from EBITDA from acquisitions?","Stuart Brown","I mean, the numbers that we've provided include Credit Suisse, right. So the guidance numbers include Credit Suisse assuming that closes here later in the first quarter.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Right. Okay. I was just trying to get a kind of an organic growth of what you guys are seeing, expecting versus the acquisition growth.","Bill Meaney","I think if you can think about it, Shlomo, this way, is that we expect this year \u2013 because some of the acquisitions we have, we have to build out some capacity, so I think the organic growth will be a little bit slower than what we've seen in the previous years. So I'd say mid-teens in terms of organic revenue growth, and EBITDA will grow a little bit faster than that as some of the assets stabilize because we're, obviously, moving up in terms of our EBITDA margin. But I think it's kind of \u2013 I would expect kind of mid-teens in terms of revenue growth and a little bit better on EBITDA.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And as that was the last question, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Bill Meaney","We'd just like to thank everybody for listening in, and we look forward to a continued strength in 2018. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.","As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release.","With that, I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.","C. Richard Reese","Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to our second quarter investor conference call. We had good operating results for the quarter. I'd characterize them frankly as good results in a slow world. I'll go through and give you some update on the trends and what's going on, and then -- and I'll have a few comments about the REIT process, which I'm sure you're all eager to wait to hear.","The headline is you're not going to hear everything you want to hear about their REIT, because it hasn't changed a lot, but we will at least give you some color and some update. And then Brian will go through the detailed numbers and, as usual, we'll take your questions. With a little luck, we will attempt to make this call shorter than average, because I think things are fairly clear and it's summertime.","So let's get started. As I've said, I think we're having good execution in the organization, and the businesses are performing well against our plans. We're doing not only on a tactical or an annual operating basis, but you should be comfortable that we're also advancing our long-term strategy to continue building out a very durable storage annuity business. So we're making progress on both fronts and finally trying to balance all those to deliver the short-term results while keeping an eye on the future. And I think the company and the team is doing a good job at that.","As I've said, we'll update you on the REIT process, where the only significant news, which we did announce in our press release, is that we have submitted formally our request to the IRS for a private letter ruling. And as you know that we are going to be relatively silent and absolutely not speak to any details on that while we let them do their work and so forth.","So let me talk a little bit about the operating results. Storage, which is the key driver and everything we focus on in our business, had good 6% constant dollar revenue growth, which was about 4% of that, 4 points out of 6 was internal growth and the balance from acquisitions. Service trends remain consistent within the past year or 2. There were some puts and takes, but constant dollar service growth was about flat excluding the impacts of the lower paper -- recycled paper prices. Recycled paper prices in the quarter were the major issue to us, with a 37% decline from last year, and it reduced reported service revenue growth by a negative 4% but also total revenue growth by 1.5 points.","North America, as we had planned and as we communicated, sustained good strong margins of 42% and adjusted OIBDA levels while posting 2% internal growth of storage. But total revenue growth in North America felt the brunt of recycled paper trends, hard to say, as North America accounts for about 85% of our total recycled paper volume. International had strong storage growth at 13% in constant dollars, which was 8% internal and the balance from acquisitions. They had some slight softness we experienced in International and service trends, which we suspect is part of the slowdown globally, particularly in the U.K. and in Europe and their economies. But those trends were only slight. And as I said, overall as a company, our service revenues were about flat.","Internal growth in International, particularly storage, trended up slightly due to the higher-than-average customer acquisition activity.  This was just a good, strong quarter. And although the dynamics in International are strong, this will move around a bit. So we're not forecasting these numbers. You can't draw a line forward from these numbers. These are great numbers, but I don't predict they will reoccur over and over every quarter. You will see some come back to this level in the future, but it's going to move around just a bit.","In line with our operating strategy, during the -- and we've spoken before during the quarter, and we've announced most of these. But just to recap, we acquired records management businesses in Hungary as  a fold-in to our existing business and Brazil to solidify our market leadership position, as we've previously announced. Both of these markets have strong outsourcing trends and are very consistent with our strategy to build market leadership in faster-growing emerging markets.","We also increased some ownership stakes in some joint ventures we had previously set up in Switzerland and Turkey, consistent with our long-standing joint venture strategy where we typically enter in new markets on an International basis sometimes with a less than 100% or even less than majority control. But as the businesses evolve and turn into real businesses, we seek to buy out partners or buy up, in effect, become over time to eventual ownership, and we executed a couple of those during the quarter.","International also continued to make significant progress against their benchmark target that we set 1.5 years ago to increase our margins by 700 basis points, and they generated 150 basis points of improvement during the quarter. They are on track for the full year growth of about 200 basis points, that's what their plan says, and they're on track for that. And looking forward to the end of the year, assuming they hit their plans, which we fully expect, since we announced this increase of 700 basis points, we will have reported and generated about 500 basis points or nearly 70% of the way towards our improvement target. And to remind you, we still have one more year to go to complete that target.","That margin came -- increasing came from sort of 3 big buckets. In Western Europe, sort of the International business, it was really about a lot of overhead initiatives, a lot of reengineering of cost structures and process, most of which are designed to improve our operating efficiency and effectiveness all at the same time. In Latin America, we've been focusing on our direct labor and utilization, what we call operational excellence. It's the same strategy we started in North America some years ago and then rolled it to Europe. Now we're rolling it into Latin America, and that's showing good margin enhancement, improvements. And of course, it's easier to get good margin when you got good growth. And the International businesses, as I said, have had good, strong growth. So it's a combination of those 3 that have generated that. Team's doing a good job. We expect them to continue doing that and to hit their margins.","We also saw some flow-through of some margin accretion efforts did in our corporate functions, because we started investing a little over a year ago, and some improvements where we wanted to improve our internal service to ourselves as well as reduce costs. And those investments had a price tag, both in terms of OpEx as well as capital, and they're starting to flow through. And we saw about 40 basis points of margin generated by the projects we started a little over a year ago. So I think we're in really good shape on the margin front, and frankly, given the markets we operate in and so forth, I think we're doing quite well on the revenue front right now.","A little bit of update on our strategy just to remind those that either forget or haven't been listening or new to the story, whichever the case may be, it is our goal to continue to build a very durable storage-based annuity business, as I've said in the beginning. In doing that, we have already optimized and have a very good return on investment, North American business segment, which we believe can grow in the low single-digits and maintain their margins. That is not as easy to do as it sounds. In low-growth environments, maintaining margins is very hard to do. But the team is focused on doing it and so forth. And it's a business that we will continue to invest in, and there -- around -- on the edge, there are ways of raising the growth rates a little bit. And we will keep focused on that, but it'll be a very measured kind of a process over a long period of time, because the strategy is not to build a super-high-growth business. The strategy is to maintain a really strong business there, and we're very comfortable we can do that.","Whereas International, our strategy has been over the last 18 months as we shifted the focus of the strategy away from a portfolio build-out market presence strategy to really a portfolio return strategy. And we have been driving returns on invested capital up to the point that the entire portfolio has returns in excess of a weighted average cost of capital. And when we complete the program and the margin improvement programs, these businesses as a total portfolio will be generating very strong returns. And I'll remind you that in that portfolio, some of them already have North American-like returns, quite a bit of them do. But we still have some business International that are in their [ph] early stages of development where the returns are either negative to very low. But they're faster-growing, and they will grow their way into better returns, and they will optimize their way into even better returns, as we've done all around the world. And we're on a good path to do that, and I think the team is focused on that and executing well. Part of that strategy is expanding in emerging markets through acquisitions as well as new customer acquisition work to capital leadership. We know that market leadership drives out-of-line or extraordinary returns of invested capital, and that is our goal for the entire business.","So as I said, we're executing on all levels of our operating strategy, and we feel very strong about our ability to continue to build out a very doable storage-driven business over time. Another element of that strategy, though, that relates to it that, as you know, in June, we announced is a new, focused capital allocation strategy. It is a strategy in which we've committed to return excess capital that this operating strategy will generate to our shareholders. And of course, as part of that capital allocation strategy, which is one that brings a lot of discipline, is using a tactic to pursue a new or alternative structure operating as a REIT. And you know, we've announced our intention to do that. As I've said, we believe that a REIT provides substantial benefits to our shareholders, first, for efficient capital distribution. But it also comes with a burden of extreme capital allocation discipline. And we think that, that burden is acceptable, both as a management team and as a shareholder, to take in return for the efficiency that we would get out of this structure and so forth.","So we're embarked on both a strong operating strategy to build a very sustainable long-term cash generation energy engine, by the way, one that we've been doing for a long period of time. We have reached the point, though, in which instead of consuming capital to build this business, we are in the very nice position of having significant excess capital. And as I've said, we've gone through the work to understand and believe that the right thing to do is distribute that capital to our shareholders, regardless of whether the tactics ultimately pan out to be a REIT or not. The strategy is one of disciplined capital allocation.","So let me talk a little bit about the REIT. As I've said as I started, a couple of things. This is not a subject that we're going to give you a lot on. To be frank with you, we don't have a lot to give you, more than we've already told you. We've been out on the road talking since we have made the announcement early June, and so for those -- and I would expect that most of you who got a chance to see us or hear us, there's not a lot that's changed . And frankly, what we also told you was as it did change, we're not going to give you blow-by-blow or play-by-play color on this, that and the other and so forth. If it turns out that the IRS approves us, obviously, we'll tell you. If they reject us, we'll, obviously, tell you. If we were to find a reason it couldn't work, we will, obviously, tell you. But we're going about trying to execute on becoming a REIT. We're taking a positive hypothesis approach, which means that we filed for approval from the IRS.  While they do their thinking and their work and so forth, we're moving forward with a process to restructure our business to separate entities into the QRS\/TRS structure and to have ourselves ready to be a REIT as of January 1, 2014. We've said it before and I'm going to reiterate, it's -- and the more we look, the more I'll have to say this is it's a lot of work. And as you know, we forecast $100 million to $150 million of work to get there. Obviously, we expect the payback to be worth it.","We've made significant progress. We've established a task force office headed by Jeff Lawrence. Jeff, as many of you know, is our Treasurer, but he's also been a long-term mountaineer and he has managed prior to this many of our major -- anytime we've had major change projects, such as Y2K and things like that, Jeff has been the go-to guy. He's got extraordinary skills and knowledge of the business, so he knows where every -- all the pieces and parts are. He's organized a team of over 25 full-time people, most of which came up -- we pulled out of other jobs and we're staffed behind them. We've almost completed that REIT staffing behind them, because we see that they're going to be this for a couple of years. We went and tried to pull people that are high-potential strong performers, and basically, making sure that they understand that this is a career-enhancing process. This is the project that you want to be part of, and I think we've chosen quite a bit of good talent to help us do that. That number of people would be augmented over time. I mean, quite frankly, to give you a picture of it, we've had to take another floor in our corporate office building just to house what we expect this workflow to be. And we'll get to be over time significantly more people, some part-time, some full-time. In addition to that, we have a group of outside advisors, primarily but not solely PWC [ph], on the actual technical conversion side because they have direct experience of doing this and direct experience, same team, same people of doing it for nontraditional REIT conversions, which is what we are and which is where the real complexity comes, okay? And IBM and other technology partners, but primarily IBM, is helping us over a lot of the systems work. They -- at the core of this transition is a lot of accounting and IT work and -- with a strong dose of legal and contract work. And it requires us to put in some new systems to get more granular detail on some of our details and systematize them and so forth. Net-net, all of this work we will do will make us a  better business. And it would be hard work, but it -- plenty doable if we were doing it for one country, but we're going to do it across the majority of our big businesses around the globe. So I only stress all of that just to give you an appreciation of we're on it, we're not waiting. That is why we're spending money pretty fast. So far, the money that we put in the quarter was not that big. But stay tuned, those numbers will get bigger as we try to separate out and make sure you see the operating side of the business versus what we're spending to achieve this target.","So as I've said, I think we feel real good about where we are, both in terms of the process of the REIT, I feel real good about how the business is operating at this point in time. I wish the world were a little faster. I'm not used to this slow pace, it drives me batty.  So with that, let's turn it to Brian. He'll go through the details, and we'll come back to take your questions.","Brian P. McKeon","Thanks, Richard. Turning to our presentation, Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid performance in Q2, in line with our expectations, reflecting consistent business trends. Storage -- strong storage revenue growth and International performance again drove our overall results. We achieved 6% constant dollar storage revenue growth in the quarter, supported by internal growth that routed 4% and benefits from our recently completed acquisitions.","Storage gains continue to be solid globally despite soft economic conditions, demonstrating the durability of our business. International storage grew 13% constant dollar, augmenting the solid 3% constant dollar storage growth posted by the North American business.","We continue to expand our International business while driving higher returns, consistent with our 3-year strategic plan. Adjusted OIBDA margin in the International segment increased 150 basis points on 8% constant dollar revenue growth. Our International business is performing well, and we remain on track to achieve our International margin targets in 2013. Overall, our operating results remain solid and in line with our expectations.","Revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 2% on a constant dollar basis. As noted in previous calls, sharp declines in recycled paper prices are constraining our operating gains this year. In Q2, lower year-on-year paper prices reduced revenues by $11 million. Excluding these impacts, adjusted OIBDA was up 7% on a comparable basis in Q2, reflecting continued storage gains and benefits from International margin expansion and overhead cost controls. On a reported basis, FX changes also constrained reported results. Excluding these macro factors, underlying business trends were consistent with prior quarters. Storage revenues continue to grow steadily, and hybrid service gains are offsetting soft core service activity levels.","We remain on track to achieve our full year financial goals, and we're reiterating our underlying revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook for the full year 2012. We're maintaining a consistent outlook for constant dollar revenue growth while lowering our projections for reported results by $15 million at midpoint to reflect current FX rates. Our adjusted OIBDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS ranges are unchanged from our previous outlook. These estimates reflect our underlying operations and exclude costs associated with the Special Committee and REIT conversion. We'll be tracking these costs separately as we work through the conversion process.","Let's now turn to Slide 4 and review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our operating results for this quarter to the second quarter of 2011. Please note that we'll be referring to our operating results throughout this presentation. Operating results exclude costs and other expenditures associated with the 2011 proxy contest, the Special Committee and REIT conversion costs.","In Q2 2012, we incurred $3 million of costs related to the Special Committee work compared to about $10 million of costs related to the proxy contest in Q2 of 2011. We're excluding these items, which are expected to be significant over the next several quarters, in order to better present the underlying performance of the business. The primary line items that will be impacted are adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS, CapEx and free cash flow. For your information, slides reconciling operating results to our reported results for key metrics are included in the appendix.","As noted, Q2 operating results were solid and in line with our expectations, reflecting consistent business trends. Enterprise revenue growth was 2% on a constant dollar basis, with reported results pressured by unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. Overall, revenue performance reflected strong constant dollar storage growth -- revenue growth of 6%, which more than offset the impact of lower recycled paper revenues, which reduced total revenue growth by 1.5%.","From a segment perspective, North America posted constant currency revenue growth of minus 1% as consistent 2% storage internal growth was offset by a 6% decline in service revenues, including the impact of lower paper prices. Excluding paper price changes, North American service growth was down modestly.","Gains in project and data protection revenues and benefits from fuel surcharges offset decreased core service activity levels and lower revenues from shredding and fulfillment services. Our International segment posted 8% constant currency revenue growth, supported by 13% storage growth, reflecting sustained gains in Europe, continued double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific and benefits from our recently completed acquisition in Brazil. These gains were again augmented by strong hybrid service revenues, which offset impacts from lower paper prices, and lower revenues from product sales and shredding services.","Gross profit was $439 million in Q2, yielding a gross margin of 58.4%, down 110 basis points compared to the same prior-year period. Storage gross margins increased 100 basis points, reflecting lower occupancy costs. Service gross margins were down year-on-year due to decreased recycled paper revenues, the previously disclosed reclassification of certain overhead expenses to costs of sales and the growth of relatively lower-margin businesses, including our hybrid services. Adjusted OIBDA was $239 million or 31.8% of revenues, up 40 basis points compared to Q2 of 2011. Strong performance in our International business and the benefits from corporate overhead cost initiatives more than offset negative impacts from lower paper prices.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.36 per share, an increase of 9%. The improvement was primarily due to fewer shares outstanding following substantial share repurchases in 2011. Reported earnings per share of $0.24 includes $3 million of excluded items, $10 million of other expense and the impact of a higher effective tax rate due to foreign currency losses and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 40%.","Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q2 and year-to-date growth is trending consistent with our full year expectations by a major service line. As noted, constant dollar growth was 2% in Q2, driven by strong storage gains.","Storage internal growth remained solid at 4%. North America reported consistent 2% internal storage growth, and International storage internal growth remains strong at 8%. Net global Records Management volume was up more than 1% on a year-on-year basis in Q2, reflecting continued strong gains in International, offsetting a modest year-on-year decline in North America. Pricing trends remain consistent, with a 2% net increase in North American Records Management.","Total service internal growth was minus 5% or down about 2% excluding impacts from commodity changes. These results were also consistent with underlying trends in recent quarters. Core service internal growth was minus 3% in the quarter as growth in the hybrid services and benefits from fuel surcharges offset lower shredding service revenues and moderate declines in activity-based core services. Complimentary service revenues representing about 11% of total revenues decreased 12% internally. Results were driven entirely by $11 million decline in recycled paper revenues, as expected. The impact in Q2 was greater than the impact in Q1 as 2012 paper prices have remained fairly stable against sharply rising prices in the first half of 2011. Assuming paper prices remain stable for the balance of the year, the gap should widen in third quarter before reversing itself in the last couple of months of the year.","Let's now take a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 6. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date 2012 operating performance compared to the first half of 2011. Our year-to-date performance reflects consistent business trends. Reported revenue of $1.5 billion is up 1% on a constant dollar basis as continued solid storage gains offset impacts from lower recycled paper prices and soft core service activity. Lower paper prices and the SG&A reclass discussed earlier contributed to a modest decline in gross margins.","Despite these impacts, adjusted OIBDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis, slightly ahead of revenue growth. Strong International profit performance and corporate overhead cost initiatives are key factors in this improvement. We expect these factors to continue to support profit performance as we move forward.","Adjusted EPS was $0.67 per share, up 8% for the year-to-date. EPS benefited from about 15% fewer shares outstanding, more than offsetting higher interest costs incurred to support our $1.2 billion shareholder payout program that we completed earlier this year.","2012 capital spending is $76 million, excluding $11 million of acquired real estate. As a percentage of revenues, CapEx excluding real estate is 5.1%, in line with prior year levels. Capital expenditures historically increased in the second half of the year. We're currently on track to achieve our capital spending efficiency targets in 2012. Free cash flow for the first half of 2012 was $117 million compared to $149 million for the first half of 2011. The decrease is primarily due to higher interest expense in support of our shareholder payout program and higher cash incentive compensation payments related to 2011 performance. These results exclude year-to-date costs of $5 million in 2012 and $14 million in 2011 associated with the REIT conversion, Special Committee and prior year proxy costs. These year-to-date costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.02 and free cash flow by about $3 million. Through the end of Q2, we've not made any capital expenditures or incremental tax payments related to the REIT conversion. We expect to make these types of payments in the second half of this year. I'll have more to say on this in the Outlook section of the presentation.","Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 key segments compared to the same period in 2011. Consistent with our 3-year plan, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segment while continuing to build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. In the first half of 2012, our North America business segment reported revenues of $1.1 billion, supported by consistent 2% storage revenue gains. Overall, North America growth was constrained by the impact of lower recycled paper prices. Despite these impacts, we sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%. We also continued to achieve capital efficiencies, with spending at about 4% of revenues excluding real estate. These metrics support very strong cash generation from this business.","Our International segment continues to post solid constant dollar revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. As noted, adjusted OIBDA increased 15% excluding FX impacts, yielding 180 basis points of margin expansion. We're benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Latin America. Benefits from these initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio has us on track towards our business plan goals of 25% margins in 2013. Corporate expenses improved slightly compared with prior-year levels due to overhead cost control initiatives. Overall, we continue to drive solid operating performance across our portfolio.","Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 8. Strong consistent cash flow generation has enabled us to maintain a strong balance sheet. We're currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5x, comfortably within our target 3 to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio will likely increase over the next few quarters as we make expenditures in connection with the REIT conversion process.","We remain well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $600 million, with $170 million in cash and $455 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our debt portfolio at June 30, 2012 also remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was down to 6.6%, and we were nearly 80% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is about 6 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014.","During the second quarter, we paid $43 million in regular quarterly dividends at a rate of $0.25 per share. In June, the board increased the dividend rate by 8% to $0.27 per share. We're managing our balance sheet and cash flows consistent with our strategy, and we're well positioned to fund our business plan.","That concludes our review of Q2 2012 results. Overall, we continue to drive solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our goals in 2012.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our full year outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our current 2012 operating outlook. The chart also highlights our expected expenditures related to the ongoing REIT conversion process. Today, we're reiterating our constant dollar revenue growth guidance and our projections for adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We are lowering the midpoint of our revenue projections by $15 million to reflect current FX rates, which weakened relative to the U.S. dollar since our last call. We're projecting 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $2,990,000,000 to $3,040,000,000 at current FX rates, reflecting consistent 2% to 4% constant dollar growth excluding the impact of lower paper prices. We're maintaining our outlook for adjusted OIBDA to be in the range of $890 million to $930 million on an operating basis. Adjusted EPS for 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.36, unchanged for the prior outlook. The calculation of adjusted EPS assumes a 40% structural tax rate and 172 million shares outstanding.","We now expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $225 million, including an estimated $30 million for real estate. The increase reflects a real estate lease buyout opportunity we recently took advantage of in Ireland. Our outlook for operating free cash flow continues to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million.","As highlighted in a recent announcement of our intent to pursue conversion to a REIT, we anticipate significant one-time operating capital costs associated with the conversion. Total operating expense and capital costs are estimated to be between $100 million to $150 million, with the majority deployed over the next 2 to 3 years. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. This effort is under way, and we'll be breaking out and reporting on estimated impacts as we advance the process.","For 2012, in addition to the operating expense expectations discussed above, we expect to incur between $10 million to $20 million of incremental expense, $10 million of CapEx and about $80 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction in adjusted EPS of $0.03 to $0.07 and free cash flow of $95 million to $105 million.","The current full year outlook does not include any projected impact from potential 2012 distribution of earnings and profits in connection with the conversion. A slide laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA is included in the appendix.","That concludes our review. In summary, Q2 was another quarter of solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2012. We continue to execute against our 3-year plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we're also advancing working connection with the REIT conversion process as long -- as part of our long-term approach to drive value creation for our stockholders.","Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question, just on Europe, your commentary on the International segment was positive. But how should we think about the impact of what seems like it's been pretty evident deterioration over the last few months in the economic activity across the continent?","C. Richard Reese","Well, as you know, in our business, on the way down, we tend to lag.  On the way up, we tend to lag. And I think we probably are seeing that. Storage remains strong and -- even in Europe and International in general. And I think storage will hold up okay, if not do fine through this. Service, we saw softness.  Just as we saw it come down in North America, we saw it in this quarter. It'll find a new good [ph] point when their economy settles and sort of stay there. Whether we've hit that yet or not, I don't know. But net-net, as I've said in my comments, we've had some puts and takes. We've had some strengths and other pieces and parts of things, so overall, our services are about flat if you take recycled paper out. So on a global basis, I think we're feeling all right. I mean, we're not projecting it going to rise, don't get me wrong. But I think we're feeling all right.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And -- but just on that lag comment, so could things likely get worse next year? And I guess, is there any risk to the margin target for International?  Or do you think you've got a pretty conservative case built into how you're thinking about it?","C. Richard Reese","Well, I don't think we have a conservative case. But I think we can deliver it, yes.","Brian P. McKeon","The margin improvement is really driven by things in our control...","C. Richard Reese","Yes, it's mostly stuff we can control.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just any update on how you're thinking about the succession plan for the CEO role?","C. Richard Reese","Yes, I'm trying to get out. No, look, we're -- it's a very methodical process. And we -- and look, the board is working quite hard and being pretty methodical about it. But look, the truth is I'm not putting the feet to the fire. I started down this path to help the company get a line around a strategy, which I think we've done really well, the business has. And part of that strategy was the capital allocation strategy. As I've said, we've done our year of homework, and we've come out the other end with a direction, and now we go about executing. I'm not running from the completion of that. So it's a matter of finding the right person when we find him at the right time, and until we do, I'll stay here and try to help the team get this stuff across the goal line.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just one cleanup one.  Can you give us a sense how much you spent on all these acquisitions in the quarter? And was the revenue contribution material, or were they all pretty small deals?","Brian P. McKeon","It's roughly $90 million in the quarter -- I'm sorry, $98 million. The bulk of that was Brazil and the Swiss buyout.  This year, we won't see a lot of profit flow through just because the integration cost in Brazil will offset some of the benefit. But it'll be nicely accretive for us as we head into 2013.","C. Richard Reese","And by the way, the -- not always, but the nature of the kinds of acquisitions we would likely do international will be the kind of things where you buy now and it will take you 12-plus months to really see the synergy, because we're not typically buying new footprint. There will be some rare exceptions to that statement. But we already did the heavy lifting of putting the footprint in place. Now we're really try to buy major fold-in, tuck-in. And the big fold-in, tuck-ins take a little time to do right and continue growing fast and maintain and so forth. So we're taking our time on those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Andrew. I want to ask a question about the slide that goes through global volume trends. I would have thought, given the storage growth being at 4%, kind of a nice, accelerated level that we haven't been at for a while, that chart that you have in the slide decks would also show acceleration. Could you go through the differences between what that slide is trying to portray and how it ties back to storage internal growth?","Brian P. McKeon","And so the slide actually is a -- it takes quarterly performance and annualizes it, Andrew. And so it's because we're trying to break it out across these key metrics that we found that that's the easiest way to show it. And that compares to when we talk about that growth, we're talking about year-over-year volume. So it's slightly different. I think the key theme here is more consistency than change in terms of the trends. If you look at the storage growth in the quarter, it rounded to 4%. It was a little -- it was 3.5%, actually. And we've been in that 3% range for the last -- since, I think it's 7, 8 quarters now. Some of the benefit was -- improvement was related to customer acquisition activity in International, just in terms of, as you know, kind of the old [indiscernible] terminology that we use when we acquire customers from other businesses, customer relationships we had, some of that flow-through from a timing of...","C. Richard Reese","And, Andrew, I think you sort of said it's just a good, strong quarter, how do we portraying? Look, we're positive about the business in the economy we operate in. It's a crappy world out there, okay? But we're not suggesting -- in fact, I am cautioning, that you don't take a strong storage quarter and try to project it forward that we're going to stay at these levels. I don't believe we will. I think we'll move up and down. We'll see this level again, I'm not saying that, okay? But it might not be next quarter or the quarter after. I think we're going to be hovering around the 3%, 3-ish range, give or take, 3.5%, 2.75%, hovering around there. And they round the different numbers, as you know. We'll be hovering around those ranges. And I think we can do that very well and so forth, but we're not talking about major acceleration here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just want to get some color on your acquisitions in Hungary, Switzerland and Turkey. How did the acquisitions position you from a market share perspective, and when can you expect to achieve market leadership in those countries?","C. Richard Reese","In Hungary, it was a nice bolt-in and we already had market leadership there. It was just good economics. Switzerland, we've got leadership in everything except Geneva. And Turkey, we are a strong #2.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, that's very helpful. And could you give us a sense of how -- just globally, how activity-based core services performed and how much hybrid services contributed to growth?","C. Richard Reese","[indiscernible] while I look [ph].","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, I was thinking -- hybrid services were a -- were up solidly on a global basis. It wasn't -- it was probably a point or so of contribution net to our overall service growth. And that helped to moderate the -- basically helped to offset the continued moderate decline we've seen in service levels in places like the U.S. And, as Richard noted, I think the International...","C. Richard Reese","Some acceleration in the International.","Brian P. McKeon","International was not -- International had been growing quite well, and we saw that moderate somewhat. So that could be a leading indicator.","C. Richard Reese","And as you know, we fully expect that our hybrid business, as it gets bigger and it's still growing well, will overcome other declines in the physical business. I'm not calling that turn yet, but this quarter, that pretty much happened. But again, I wouldn't say it's for sure it's going to happen next quarter or the one after. Still a little early to tell that we're drawing the lines yet, guys.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then last question. You touched on this earlier but could you give us a sense of how the volatility in Europe is impacting core and complementary services? I know you're on track to achieving the margin expectations, but do you see any negative impact and deceleration in growth due to that?","Brian P. McKeon","We haven't for the last -- in terms of our business overall, I think it's held out very well. And I think the team [ph] feels good about the ability to sustain that. We are highlighting at the margin, we're seeing some deceleration level of growth in the service activity. But I would say the theme is more that we're holding up quite well. And I think we're going to plan the business prudently and make sure we're managing appropriately in an environment that could get softer for us. But I think it's more -- at this stage, more at the margin and something that we're keeping an eye on.","C. Richard Reese","Yes, and look, I'd tell you, sort of the key theme if you look at our total growth and so forth is our Shredding businesses, although they're growing on units and everything else, we see some price compression. So a good part of that. It used to be -- it still is a very aggressive price market. Although, in general, at the Street, that has modified itself a bit as paper prices have come down, which is what you'd expect. We are still rolling off some rather large multi-year agreements that were priced in a different market environment, and as they roll off, they get repriced. We'll -- that will run off, but the tail of that's coming, and it'll run off and so forth. But our -- but the Shredding business between that dynamic and the -- and, of course, the paper prices themselves is as much a drag on total revenue as anything, so forth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Following up on your comments on paper prices. We've heard that expectation in the market is that prices should actually gradually improve over the course of the year.  Are you hearing the same, and any additional color there?","C. Richard Reese","We've heard conflicting data. Some people say they believe at the demand level, it's strengthening, at the front-line demand level, it's strengthening.  That would naturally lead to some increase, and others say not. So we don't have an opinion on that right now. But look, North America may strengthen while Europe doesn't. Some of this will be about where China goes, because a lot of this recycled paper winds up in China. And their economy -- you guys know better than I do the changes going on over there. So I think it's a little early to make a call.","Brian P. McKeon","There's a bit of seasonality in the business where the pricing goes down a bit in the back half of the year normally. We've seen sort of modest improvement on the sorted office paper rate. So we'll -- it's gotten relatively better, but this does get tied into the overall demand situation. So right now, we're -- the numbers that we're using basically reflect the debt that [indiscernible] will sustain.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on your global records management slide, it looks like you had the lowest level of destructions in the past 10 quarters. Anything going on there?","Brian P. McKeon","We did see -- it's a little different geographically. But actually, in Europe, we've seen a decline in some of the destruction levels. These things tend to move around a fair bit where you have some larger destructions that people may be planning, and you work through them. And so there is some volatility in that, but we've seen some contraction there that's helping...","C. Richard Reese","And by the way, the Europe destruction pattern is behaving the way the business historically always behaved except for the 2007, '08 financial crisis period, which is in slowdowns, people delay destructions because they're protecting their current year budget. So as the storage pickup -- storage charge, rental pickup for destroying the item is not as large as the -- in the current period, as large as the destruction fee, and they try to protect their budget. And I suspect that's what we're seeing there now.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. And then if I could fit one more in. You bought the controlling interests in your Turkish and Swiss JVs this quarter. Were the acquisitions related to the REIT conversion at all? I mean, are you going to maybe accelerate kind of converting JVs into company-owned quicker because of the REIT conversion?","C. Richard Reese","No, no. The JVs themselves, by and large, the ones we have right now are in kind of the emerging markets, strong, extreme emerging market front. And -- which means they would be late in our cycle of REIT conversion, as in not this year or next or the year after. Over due course of time, we would want to deal with those sort of things. But we're not going to be pushed into doing that.","Brian P. McKeon","We're starting with what makes sense from a strategic point of view, a value-creation point of view, and then we'll factor in how to think about the REIT more as the tail on that kind of consideration. So these are good, strategic investments that we'd be doing regardless of the path we're pursuing as a company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Brian, can you remind us, on the core services side, just round numbers, what percentage is kind of related to the destruction and other type services just to kind of get a sense of the contributions to that revenue line item?","Brian P. McKeon","It's a smaller part, so I'm going to find it. But 5% we're seeing. So it's -- we have a long list of services that we provide there in core services, the bigger items are things like transportation activity. But destruction services contribute to that. Overall, the core services are a little north of 30% of total revenues.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then in terms of timing on the distribution of the equity, is that something, Richard, we can talk about now? Or just any sense of -- I know the IRS is in the process of the private letter ruling. But just any sense of timing around when we can expect any update on that?","C. Richard Reese","Well, our view hasn't changed from what we've said in early June. And that view is that we would strongly consider, but we haven't 100% committed to, but strongly consider doing a major E&P purge sometime during this year. I think you would expect it towards the back end of the year. And there's a lot of mechanics to actually making that work since it would be a combination of cash and stock. But we're moving forward on that front as all others. That decision in itself does not depend upon the, necessarily, the private letter ruling, in fact.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Understood, that's helpful. And then are we going to have an Investor Day this year? Is that back on, or...","C. Richard Reese","Yes, we are -- we had hoped to have the precise date. We don't yet. We're nailing down the venue and we -- but we will have an Investor Day in October in New York City. And within a couple of days, we expect to have out the invitation with the exact date and time and so forth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First, I wanted to start off with a couple of technical questions. Just Brian, on the $10 million to $20 million of cost that you're experiencing this year, did you say that, that was outside of the $100 million to $150 million that you previously talked about in the June conference call?","Brian P. McKeon","Sorry if we confused on that. No, it's a subset of that, so it's within the $100 million, $150 million. We expect to incur $10 million to $20 million of OpEx this year and about $10 million of capital. The $100 million to $150 million is both the OpEx and capital. I think our estimates were -- was like 60% capital, which is largely the systems, and 40% OpEx. But we'll be breaking this out for you as we go, and actually, we'll start adding some tracking relative to the overall estimates for you as well so it's very clear how we're...","C. Richard Reese","And it will -- and that will get spread beyond January 1, 2014, because there's -- it's a strategy to get ourselves to the point where we can legally convert and operate. But it won't be as pretty as it likely -- we'd like it to be by that date, and we will continue working beyond that. So those expenses will flow on beyond that.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. Just in terms of that process, now that the team has been kind of assembled and started off on this path, Richard, just kind of curious. I mean, obviously, very complex. Can you just give us any positive or negative surprises that may have arisen that couldn't -- that could help or hinder your ability to hit that January 2014 date?","C. Richard Reese","No, I don't -- look, I -- we've gone to the detailed planning. I think we have 20-odd work streams all running in parallel. We've got program managers, project managers. We've really gotten it organized as just as a massive kind of project. But look, the tall pole on the tent, so to speak, is in the systems arena. And it's primarily in the arena of -- we actually have to change our charter of accounts for our entire accounting system and, in many ways, update some technology and\/or convert technology, particularly some of the global platforms. And some of that, we made two-step because it's too much risk to do one-step. And when you're doing that much technology change, to be candid with you, our goal is to have all those systems operating mid-next year to give us 6 months of working out the kinks and making sure nothing happens. And our head -- our Chief Information Officer is sweating a lot right now. He and his team are doing good work, and they'll get it done. And so, no, we're not -- this is not something that I lay awake at night worrying about. But then again, I don't do this kind of execution. Brian does it, and his team and Jeff and [indiscernible], those guys do it. And they're sweating a bit and complaining to me not go off and do anything else, but that's not my nature either.","Brian P. McKeon","To your question, no surprises. We thought it was a lot of work, and that's turning out to be true. And we'll -- we've got a really good team working on it and committed to getting this done.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And the -- just thinking about the capital base and some of the capital needs that you have this year, Richard, can you kind of just update our thinking? It sounds like you mentioned the $600 million of liquidity that you have today. That would be, I guess, all of your cash and all of your credit facility. Can you talk about kind of what you're seeing out in the market to maybe fund any hole that you might have in the capital base to do the E&P in some of these other investments?","Brian P. McKeon","What I -- we have discussed it's likely we're going to go to the market at some point to help fund that, and we'll update you as we move forward on that. But we will likely want to put some more kind of financing in place...","C. Richard Reese","Yes, and our sense is the market environment is quite good right now.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","When you -- you mentioned in your comments here that your guidance does not impact any -- or does not reflect any impact of the E&P distribution.  Is that really the financing terms of that E&P distribution? Is there any other impact that it would have to your P&L, or is it the cost?","Brian P. McKeon","It would include the -- obviously, there is a cash outflow. But keep in mind, too, if we did  a majority of our E&P distribution this year, which is -- which has been our plan that we signal. There would be a number of shares that are issued, right, that go along with it. So we...","C. Richard Reese","Per-share metrics would change, your interest cost would change and so forth.","Brian P. McKeon","It effectively works like a stock split. But we haven't plugged any of that into the outlook, and we'll obviously get you more details as we firm up plans there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolas.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to piggyback a little bit on the last line of questioning. Just to be clear, you're thinking of funding -- you're going to fund the gap with debt, not equity, right?","C. Richard Reese","Yes, that would be our current intention, recognizing that we're going to do, likely, 80% of it in issuance of the stock, yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The question is in order to get into the REIT structure, the whole that you have in terms of the capital, that's going to require you to raise capital.  You're planning to do that with a debt offering or more bank debt, but it is not going back to the markets for an equity offer.","C. Richard Reese","Correct. We don't need equity. We don't need equity.  And I'm never going to say we won't go to the markets for equity. You tell me the price, and I'll tell you if we'll go. But as we sit here today, we don't perceive going to the markets. It's not in my -- our thinking at the moment for equity. I would tell you, though, just to be clear, just to close out that subject for you a little bit. As we do M&A, we may use some equity and transactions to the extent that the deals are highly accretive to our shareholders, okay? We might do something like that.  But that's not going to be major, it's not going to be big numbers.","Brian P. McKeon","Yes. And as we talked in our announcement, over time, we think it will make sense to operate at lower level -- leverage levels. And so equity may be part of our future plans, but it's not a requirement for us to get into the structure. We're well positioned to get to -- to fund that conversion.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I mean, one of the things, obviously -- I mean, I know the economy hasn't been helpful in this in terms of the service revenues always consistently being a pain in your side every quarter. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what turns that around or in terms of just finally reaching such easy comps that it doesn't get any worse?","C. Richard Reese","Well, I think we're seeing that's an area of North America. And the decline rates are slowing, okay? And it'll drift in the right space there. And it's hard to know what -- where Europe is going, I mean, quite candidly. But Europe does not -- we don't have quite the risk profile in Europe. Our business there is much less active in the physical side, because we don't have a big medical business. And still the #1 driver of that decline is a health care trend. It's not the economy. The economy is the second driver of that decline. And which is, primarily in North America, an issue totally. So the fact that we don't have the big driver in healthcare will mean it's not going to impact us that much. It's likely be on the margin kind of stuff.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick question, too, in -- part of the margin improvement in North America, you've mentioned in the press release the lower occupancy cost. Is that because you're already starting to consolidate some facilities there?  Or is it just lower lease cost and lower property values, et cetera?","Brian P. McKeon","We're always working to optimize the utilization our network. We have improved that a bit. And I think that's reflective of the work that we're doing on that front, as well as utility cost.  I think we're down a bit as well in the quarter. But it does reflect the work that we're doing to optimize the real estate.","C. Richard Reese","So thank you very much for giving us this hour. We appreciate your support and so forth. As we did mention earlier, we will be out. There's 1 more -- 1 or 2 more conferences we'll be at. We'll be at the Barclays Conference in a few weeks in New York.  Next week, they're telling me.  I got to look at my calendar more carefully, I guess. But we are driving towards an Investor Day in October, and we'll be out shortly with a precise date and location, so hopefully you can put it in your calendar. We would expect at that Investor Day to talk quite a bit about what we see forward, finishing out our 3-year plan. I think we've started about 18 months ago making sure you see that we're on track there.  We'll expect to be talking a little bit about how we're going to build a more durable business. Hopefully, give you -- likely give you some access to some of the key managers that are doing it. And then, of course, we will be talking not about the REIT process, because we'll be in the middle of it. We won't know anything, and if we did, we wouldn't tell you anyway. We will be talking about, though, what Iron Mountain might look like as a REIT a bit more than we have and so forth. So I think you'll hopefully find that a useful time to come and spend a morning or so with us.","Again, thank you, and we hope you will all have a good summer. And we'll see you later.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12711":["Iron Mountain, Inc.

My name is Felicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I will now like to hand the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Felicia, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","As I'm sure, everyone joining us this morning knows, we also announced an agreement in principle to acquire Recall. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter, some key points related to the proposed transaction, as well as progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial results.","After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations\/Financial Information. We've also posted there a brief presentation related to the proposed Recall transaction at the same location.","Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and in the Recall presentation and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Let me first extend our apology for such a short notice on the change in timing for the release of first quarter results. But given that it was driven by our agreement in principle to acquire Recall, we felt it was important to combine the news.","I would like to start by saying, we are pleased to announce that our results in the first quarter meet or exceed our expectations. We continue to build operational momentum in the business, which is, in turn, driving strong financial results in spite of the significant FX headwinds. However, given the breaking news associated with the agreement in principle to acquire Recall, I'd like to start with the discussion of this agreement.","First, I should say, we are very excited about our agreed proposal to acquire Recall. We think this proposed transaction represents an attractive value proposition supported by significant synergies and believe it will be highly accretive. Our revised offer reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other favorable changes since our last proposal, particularly regarding transaction related tax assumptions.","Of course, we have yet to complete due diligence to reach a definitive agreement and the successful completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions noted in today's press release. We have a few slides related to the proposal, the proposed transaction that we have posted to our Investor Relations website, which I'll touch on briefly.","Turning first to slide three, the proposed acquisition is an all stock deal at a fixed exchange rate of 0.1722 of an Iron Mountain share for each Recall share. Additionally, we've made a provision that each Recall shareholder can elect up to a maximum of 5,000 shares to be paid in cash at AUD$8.50 per share subject to a cap on the total cash consideration of AUD$225 million.","On slide five, we estimate there is an opportunity to achieve synergies of between US$125 million and US$140 million driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead. We expect to realize 50% of these synergies in year two, which will already yield by year two, high-single digit accretion in EPS, FFO and AFFO.","Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that, it supports our de-leveraging strategy. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms with Recall having a more developed presence with the small-to-medium businesses in the U.S. whilst we have more significant presence with larger enterprise customers in the U.S.","Turning to slide six, we also have complementary geographic coverage with Recall having more exposure to faster growing international markets. Slide seven provides a bit more detail on the benefits to Recall shareholders, including the ability through stock ownership to participate in future upside and be supported through a secondary listing in Australia.","Slide eight shows more detail on our estimated net synergies as well as our expected integration and other costs that would be incurred in year one to achieve those synergies. Assuming the midpoint of the synergy range, consensus estimates of Recall's 2015 EBITDA and the fixed exchange ratio, we estimate our going-in EBITDA multiple is just over 12 times and is reduced by 4 turns to 4.5 turns on a fully synergized basis, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed transaction.","Lastly, on slide nine, we've provided a list of next steps in the process.","With that overview of the proposed transaction, let me turn to our results. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, extending recent progress with continued positive organic volume growth in solid storage rental internal growth.","We continue to execute on our three-year strategic plan, which rests on three pillars; getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster growing emerging markets, and continue to explore adjacent opportunities in our emerging business segment.","Rod will have more details in a few minutes but I'll start by highlighting that on a constant dollar basis, our financial results for the first quarter were in line or ahead of our expectations, with total revenue up 2% and adjusted OIBDA up 5.7% on a constant dollar basis or 4.5% on a constant dollar basis if normalized for restructuring charges as shown on page 20 in our supplemental.","We saw further strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter, which impacted our reported results, but the fundamental trends in the business remains solid and we are pleased with the momentum. Our results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our strategic plan.","If you reviewed our supplemental disclosure before the call today, you probably noted that we added a further breakdown of our International business. Effective with this quarter's reporting; we've broken the former International segment into Western Europe and Other International.","With this segment change, we've consolidated executive leadership of North America and Western European markets under Patrick Keddy to provide better focus and alignment within our developed markets.","Patrick has run our UK and Western European markets for several years now, having originally joined us from Pitney Bowes, where he ran its entire business outside the U.S., including operations in 28 countries.","JT Tomovcsik will continue to run our North American Records and Information Management business and Eileen Sweeney will add Western Europe to her leadership responsibilities and will head Data Management in all developed markets.","She and JT will coordinate their efforts through Patrick. This integration of executive leadership in North America and Western Europe will allow us to present a single face to our major customers in our largest markets and we'll be better positioned as a global service provider not just a company with a global footprint.","Marc Duale will continue to run emerging markets through the Other International segment, which covers Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. This segment also includes Australia as it is easy to manage within this segment due to the geographic proximity.","We think this structure will better fuel our continued momentum in developed markets and continue our expansion in emerging markets, thereby more closely tying performance to our strategic plan.","Turning to operating highlights, total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, grew by 4.6% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth from the Other International segment and consistent trends in Western Europe as well as North America, RIM, and DM or Data Management.","Worldwide, internal growth in storage rental of 3%, continued to show resilience. Whilst, internal growth did benefit slightly from favorable comps relative to the 1.4% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, we are seeing continued momentum and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 of between 2% and 2.5%.","In Records Management, we added roughly 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 3.5% net growth. This growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth, or in other words, before benefit from acquisitions. Importantly, North America represents nearly 25% of our net volume gains for the trailing 12 months excluding acquisitions.","Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98% in line with our fourth quarter 2014 levels, but a significant improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just two years ago.","In our Data Management business, we continue to see solid storage revenue growth, although as noted in recent quarters, we are still experiencing headwinds related to reduced frequency of customer tape rotation.","Whilst we continue to evaluate ways to right-size our cost structure to align with this trend, we are continuing to develop new product and services in the Data Management segment to leverage our strong customer relationships in the more than 200,000 stops we make each month.","During the quarter Google named us as the ingestion partner for its new Nearline cloud solution. This means we are the preferred provider to assist Google Cloud customers in uploading all the data saved in legacy data storage formats that predated cloud storage so they can better use big data. We plan to begin offering this service later this summer. We also are seeing good early reception to our Restoration Assurance Program that helps customers retrieve data from legacy media and optimize their backup environment for future technologies.","Moreover, just last week we announced a strategic relationship with EMC to deliver cloud backup and replication services, which helps customers optimize their on-premise and off-premise data protection strategy. We are the only one of their providers to offer data domain replication to the cloud with tape-out capabilities. These new initiatives are in their early days, and we are not guiding to a specific contribution from them, but they demonstrate our thought leadership, innovation capabilities and partnership with other world leaders in information management like Google and EMC.","Turning to emerging markets, we are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high growth markets represent 13.6% of our total revenue at the end of the quarter on a constant dollar basis.","Like most multinationals, we do have exposure to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. While FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our gross and adjusted OIBDA margins is almost completely muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge.","On the other hand, the current FX environment gives us a positive window in terms of investments. Given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S dollars during this part of the currency cycle.","We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in emerging markets as they are still in the early part of the outsourcing of enterprise storage. Internal storage rental growth in our Other International segment was 11.1% in the first quarter. Rod will describe more fully the impact of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on our reported performance for the quarter.","Furthermore, we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities that extend durability of the storage rental business. As we've discussed on recent calls, we plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next eight years to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. On average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going-in cap rates and market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership.","Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals. It does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we became more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and\/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth.","As you think about opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the solid durability of the business, which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone.","This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by the leaders in the industrial and self-storage sectors. And we have other attractive business characteristics that compare favorably with REITs. Our enterprise storage foundation is similar to self-storage, but we serve more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 with superior customer credit quality.","We have a diversified base of more than 155,000 business customers with 98% customer retention and a 15-year average life of box in our facilities. Our business has a very low volatility, as highlighted by a track record of 26 years the consecutive growth in storage rental revenue even throughout the recent recession. And like self-storage we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs.","We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector with the major difference that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot, yielding a very high net operating income per square foot.","Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invest in incremental Racking Structures within an existing industrial shell, we generate very strong returns due to the leverage associated with this volume achieved with reduced growth CapEx.","To wrap up, we're excited to be announcing the proposed transaction with Recall and reporting a quarter of strong operating performance. Our results were in line with or ahead of expectations and we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals. Our business is durable and generates strong cash flow that more than covers our dividend and provides a portion of growth CapEx.","And as we look at our longer-term growth potential, we have multiple capital allocation opportunities to invest in attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital and support long-term growth in our dividend.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in our business and the strong operating performance we saw in the first quarter of 2015. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental business and the benefits of acquisitions we made in developed and emerging markets in prior periods.","Before I begin, I'd like to note that our outlook for 2015 doesn't contemplate potential contribution or impact from the proposed transaction with Recall. As noted by Bill, we have yet to reach a definitive agreement; we're just embarking on the due diligence process.","To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including a review of our new segment disclosure. I'll briefly touch on our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since our update in February of this year. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens.","Let's turn to our worldwide financial results for the quarter. Referring now to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $749 million, up approximately 2.2% compared with Q1 of 2015 on a constant dollar basis.","Reported revenue for the quarter declined by 2.7% year-over-year as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5% or $37 million.","Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $231 million compared with $229 million in 2014, up 1.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased year-over-year due to improved storage profits, somewhat offset by a reduction in service profits.","In addition, overhead expenses declined partly as we are seeing the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. To illustrate the 4.5% year-over-year improvement in normalized adjusted OIBDA, we've included a bridging schedule on page 20 of our supplemental package.","Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.50 for the quarter, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $128 million. The year-over-year decline in AFFO was driven by variances in deferred tax expenses.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.32 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in the fourth quarter of 2014.","In addition, adjusted EPS was impacted by an increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt and a slightly higher structural tax rate. The increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion related expenses such as E&P purge and the D&A recapture payments. Our structural tax rate for Q1 2015 came out to 16.2% as result of a slight mix change driven by a higher income from foreign jurisdictions.","It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2014 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the longer-term. To illustrate the changes to adjusted EPS, we've included a bridging schedule on page 21 of our supplemental.","The fundamentals of our business remained strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental growth of 5%, offset by a decline in service revenue of 1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill mentioned, in an effort to look more closely tie our leadership structure to the strategic plan, we have broken out the former International segments into two segments, Western Europe and Other International, to facilitate managing the business along the developed emerging lines we've talked about in the past.","I will now discuss Records Management or RM volume trend across this new segmentation. As you can see in the supplemental, on pages 10 and 11, we've expanded our disclosure by illustrating Records Management volume trends by segments.","As you can see, we've achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 5.4% in Western Europe, and 12.9% in the Other International segments, reporting Global Records Management net volume growth of 3.5%.","We continue to experience strong organic growth with first quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers who added approximately 30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months, which is consistent with prior periods.","Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. North America Records and Information Management, or RIM delivered positive storage rental internal growth and expanded OIBDA margins by more than 300 basis points during the first quarter. This expansion in adjusted OIBDA margins was driven by a decline in overhead costs as we continue to execute on our speed and agility efforts.","North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. However, service declined by 5.9% as DM tape management becomes more archival.","During the first quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 52.7%, partly as a result of the new product launches related to our Restoration Assurance Program and other initiatives that Bill covered in his remarks. We believe these will prove very positive investments for the longer-term.","The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.7% storage rental internal growth, which was partially offset by a decline of 2.6% in internal service revenue. The Western Europe business is similar to North America in its level of market maturity.","However, there are certain countries within these segments, where we don't have a strong leadership position, which in turn results in profit margins that are lower than North American margins, although returns are still well above required hurdle rates.","In addition, it's important to note that the Western Europe segment includes head office costs, which reduces our adjusted OIBDA margins. Excluding the head office costs, the margin in this segment would be in the mid to high 30% range.","Adjusted OIBDA margin percentages remain stable in the first quarter despite the decline in service revenues, although absolute dollar adjusted OIBDA fell primarily as a result of FX headwinds.","The Other International segments, which is made up of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.1%, and service internal growth was 6.8%. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high-teens to low 20%s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast growing markets.","Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was impacted by FX headwinds and integration costs. Historical data for Other International on a full year basis will be available in our amended 10-K which will be filed in the short-term.","As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in February during our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction.","Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on-track to deliver our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results. However, we believe that, we will remain within the ranges of our guidance.","As a reminder, our guidance includes an expectation of roughly 12% decline in reported non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue for 2015 relative to FX rates in place in 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. make up 40% of total worldwide revenue. As a result, we expect the FX impact on total revenue for 2015 to be 4% to 5%. Lastly, although there is no seasonality to our quarters, there is typically a moderate ramp in revenue performance as the year progresses.","Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million, which gives us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund a portion of our core growth investments. As we've previously said, we expect to fund discretionary investments including real estate and acquisitions through external funding whether through equity or borrowings.","Shifting to the balance sheet, at quarter end, we had a liquidity of more than $780 million. Quarter end, our lease adjusted ratio was 5.5 times as planned. At Monday's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 38%, in line with major REIT averages.","Turning now to REIT specific metrics, as we begin to accelerate consolidation of facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by square footage. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI approximately $27 per racked square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector.","Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 83%, respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90%s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time. We added a new page to the supplemental, page 32, which highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected return and anticipated returns. We will continue to enhance our disclosure as we move forward through the year.","Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. In an effort to ensure transparency to our shareholders, we will continue to enhance our supplemental disclosure and provide more details to help you better understand our business and its underlying fundamentals. As always we welcome your feedback.","Operator, with that, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, congratulations on Recall and actually the results, just a great outcome and obviously with the REIT just very good execution. My question was more along the lines of what does the organic growth look like, the combined entity post the deal? And then just \u2013 and I know it's probably little bit ways out but how does that impact kind of the dividend and just leverage ratios on a pro forma basis to the extent you can give us any color?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi. Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think you're going to appreciate that we haven't done our due diligence to this point, so to give us \u2013 to give you specific guidance, we're just not in a position to do that. I think that \u2013 I think you can probably get a sense of it in terms of we \u2013 we're looking at something that synergizes in the 7.5 times to 8 times range based on the $125 million to $140 million worth of synergies we've guided.","So it is clearly very accretive on EPS, FFO and AFFO, which obliviously drives to deleveraging and dividend growth. But at this point, we haven't done the due diligence on the company so we're not in a position to guide for that.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then just those synergies, Bill, they assume any potential divestitures you might have to do to the extent there is any trust concern?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","You can probably appreciate that we have taken counsel on the anti-trust side and we feel that there is a very good \u2013 a very good beneficial path through any of the hurdles that we may meet in terms of regulatory.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Super. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, thanks. Good morning. And I'll also extend my congratulations on your agreement to acquire Recall. You've outlined cost synergies between $125 million and $140 million. Can you discuss your confidence around achieving these synergies and provide some thoughts on how much tax synergies you might achieve from the transaction?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, George. I think, first of all the synergies include both tax and operational benefits. I mean it's probably fair to say we've been a little bit conservative because we've just been relying on really public information and we haven't been able to do due diligence. So we feel very confident that we can deliver those numbers but you'll notice we're probably less bullish than some of the analysts' reports that have been written previously on. So we are pretty comfortable and that is \u2013 that's including all the regulatory aspects, tax aspects and operational aspects built into that number, the puts and takes associated with that.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, maybe just to build on that, Bill and George, as you know we've done hundreds of acquisitions over the year, obviously not on this (33:55) scale. But we try to use that experience when \u2013 to come to bear in sort of calculating what we think is a sensible range for synergies (34:05).","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's helpful. And can you walk through your expectations for the regulatory approval process, including timing and your expectations around market share discussions?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Again, we've taken a counsel on that. In other words, we've been in consultation for a period of time now with external counsel that specializes in that area, and we think we can achieve a satisfactory outcome. But we haven't finalized the proposal, we haven't done any fillings. So at this point to speculate on that I think it would be pure speculation. But we do feel that based on the studies that we've done so far with external counsel that we'll achieve a satisfactory outcome.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. And then last question, can you talk about how this transaction impacts your ability to continue to operate as a REIT?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","This \u2013 our \u2013 again that was one of our key pieces of analysis that we did when we looked at the acquisition is to determine our level of confidence that we could both acquire it and absorb it into our REIT structure, in other words, convert the Recall assets into a REIT. And again, we will confirm that through the due diligence process, but we are highly confident that we can do that. So we wouldn't do it otherwise unless we could convert the Recall assets into the REIT.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, it's Andrew. Just tell me if I missed this, again I would like to know the question asked before out of the $125 million to $140 million, how much are the potential tax savings from REIT conversion?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I can give you a sort of approximate number, Andrew, based on our analysis so far. We think it's around $10 million, could be slightly more. But clearly that's one of the elements that we'd hope to get a better handle on through due diligence.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So you are only assuming $10 million, so that could be a conservative estimate.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, you have to look at the size of Recall's business in North America that is storage related, so don't forget their business is not that large in North America, it's a global business, but it's in North America where you have the tax benefits. So their tax liability in North America is not as big as you may think.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we don't get \u2013 there wouldn't be savings on the shredding business as an example.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well said. So if I can get one more question. Okay. So let's assume low tax benefits, be conservative there, you're talking about still four times turn pre to post synergies. If you look at Iron Mountain's history, it's really kind of been two times to four times, so this would be towards the high end of the synergies. And when I look at Recall's racking utilization of about 90%, that's really close to Iron Mountain's racking utilization. What other things do you know again from the public that makes you feel like you can get towards the high end of pre to post synergies, synergization multiples.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Andrew, if you \u2013 the thing that's a little bit unique about Recall, it is at the higher end, but we have achieved that before as you pointed out. And the reason why we feel that it's at the higher end and maybe it exceeds some of our best integrations is that Recall is one of the few out there that runs an international platform. So they have a lot \u2013 if you look at their SG&A, it's very different than the SG&A of a small regional player. Because they are actually built \u2013 they are running a global company with all the costs that are associated with that, albeit they are doing at a scale that's one forth our size.","So if you look at their SG&A, I think you can get a handle on why we feel that the $125 million to $140 million is actually a conservative or \u2013 we feel very confident around that number.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That was a good reminder. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys thank you for taking my questions. Bill, could you talk a little bit about the realistic timeframe \u2013 in the first year you talked about \u2013 you mentioned maybe half the synergies. What's the realistic timeframe to kind of get the balance of the synergies? Is this something that facility consolidation really takes kind of two years to five years or how should we think of that in terms of conceptually and potentially modeling it?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Shlomo, you've been around a long time, so you answer the question for me. But no, I think, it's a good question. So just to clarify, in year two there we think we'll be half way through the synergies. So the first year, I mean, first year we're assuming is 2016 just for people to be level set. So, year two would be 2017.","So we think 2016 is a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of the restructuring, then in 2017 is when you start \u2013 that that cost starts falling away and you start seeing the benefits split bleed through. So 2002 \u2013 I think at \u2013 year two 2017 we see about half the benefits coming through. And exactly as you say, we'll get a better handle on it through due diligence but the rest of it comes through \u2013 a lot of it is driven by the real estate consolidation and that generally takes the timeframe you're talking about two years to five years. It depends on the nature of their leases and our leases in the areas that we're overlapping.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just from a fundamental perspective, how is the volume growth in North American Records Management this quarter over the second half of last year, you guys generated positive growth, can you kind of talk about will the trend continue, was it up, down, the same?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, I didn't get the question. I heard the beginning of it you were referring back to the continued growth, the internal volume growth in North America but what was \u2013 what did you say at the end?","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I just \u2013 did the trend \u2013 we had for years seen volumes be down, but kind of revenue be flat to up a little bit because of pricing. The second half of last year, we saw North American volumes get to be positive, do we \u2013 in this first quarter what was the trend in North American volumes?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Actually in the supplemental on page 10, we've broken this all the key numbers out in more detail than we've done historically. And what you can see, if you were to strip out business acquisitions to just sort of look underlying, there was a 0.5% growth year-on-year in Q1 2015, which actually compares quite consistently with the previous three quarters. And then if you go back further in time looking at this chart, at the beginning of 2013, you can see that to your point was when we were at zero or negative growth.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","One thing I want \u2013 and this was feedback that we received from a number of analysts and investors. So hopefully if you look in the supplemental on pages 10 and 11, I'd direct you to those, in part of the organizational shift and putting all of the developed markets under a single leader, is we've been \u2013 we've broken out and built a lot more transparency in terms of how our volume works.","And then \u2013 so hopefully you'll start seeing, you can see how that trend has been building as you say, as Rod pointed out, Q1, we maintained the same 0.5% positive volume growth as we did in Q4, just in the North American business. And you have to remember you can say those are small percentages but it's off a very big base. So North America alone we have over 370 million cubic feet. So it's significant.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And if I just want to look ahead a little bit into the future, in terms of the REIT structure, what happens if paper pricing kind of bounces back to what it was like three years, three and half years ago, do you have enough kind of room in the REIT structure that you're not worried about coming close to any of the \u2013 kind of the restrictions that are over there in terms of assets and income?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Rod kind of answer it in detail, but the one thing, I think we covered this on previous calls, you need to keep in mind is that there is, at some point, actually increasing profitability on our shred helps us the way the test works because there is a back and forth. In other words, we have to get shred to a certain level of profitability. So, having higher prices \u2013 having higher profitability in shred doesn't necessarily lead to the result that you think it does. So that's kind of at a very high level way of saying we have plenty of headroom, but, Rod, you may want to be a bit more specific.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, there's actually a specific on shred, as Bill says around sort of cross subsidization between the QRS and the TRS, so that if we increase the profitability of shred, it would actually work to the advantage of some of our REIT tests. But I think the broader point and \u2013 that you make, Shlomo, is that around just sensitivity to issues within the business and do we have enough cushion within our REITs and against the REIT test to be able to handle that. We think we do. It's something that we're very conscious of and we analyze lots of different scenarios and sensitivities to try and ensure that that is the case.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","And very specifically which is probably what's behind your question is if we look at the acquisition of Recall, we don't envision a problem of combining. Recall's business is quite a bit smaller, their strip quite a bit smaller than ours in North America. And we don't see a problem in terms of combining those two businesses.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sachin Shah with Albert Fried.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the Recall possible offer. I just wanted to just make sure as far as risk to transaction. I know you're conducting due diligence, but is there anything that you expect that you may uncover or something that may not cause this deal to move forward after you completed due diligence?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","We wouldn't be making a public announcement about the deal if we thought there was a high risk item that would crater the deal. I mean clearly we have to do the due diligence. So, we haven't made a binding agreement, but we have an agreed proposal with Recall and we wouldn't do that if we expected to have a major hiccup in the process. So, we don't see anything.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC","Okay. And in the presentation, you mentioned the ratio is fixed and so in the due diligence process is there a subject for another revision or the due diligence is just confirmation of what's the fixed exchange ratio of 0.1722?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's fixed and it's subject to confirmatory due diligence. So, there's no \u2013 I mean there's no expectation or you'd have to renegotiate the whole term. So, it really is that we've done enough work on it that we're very comfortable that that is the right valuation. And Recall's board also feels that it's the right valuation for their shareholders. And now the next three weeks to four weeks that we highlighted in the press release is about confirmatory due diligence.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC","Okay. Just one last question, if you don't mind. On the regulatory approvals, you mentioned that you are not expecting any kind of essentially hiccups, any idea what they may be? Is it just to U.S., Australia, or is there any other jurisdictions that may be needed \u2013 major jurisdictions?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think you can understand at this point we're not going to comment on what the regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions may think or not think of it. The only thing I would just repeat is that we have taken extensive counsel from external advisors or lawyers on this point and we believe that we will achieve a satisfactory outcome in those jurisdictions.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC","Okay. So, that's not part of the due diligence, that's already done. The due diligence is more operational.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","We will also learn more about the regulatory aspects during the due diligence. Due diligence is primarily operational, but we will learn a number of things during that period which will be helpful.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much. Have a great day.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Han Zhang with Churchill Capital.","Han Zhang - Churchill Capital","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is, you said you won't comment on what are the regulatory approvals you're seeking, but could you just tell me more about in which jurisdictions you are seeking those approvals, I mean U.S., Australia, but for example, is China involved?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","At this point, we don't expect an issue in China. Both of our businesses are very small in China. I mean, the Chinese government will take their own view, I'm sure. But it's \u2013 both of us have \u2013 I mean, it improves both of our position, but neither one of us are very large in the China context.","Han Zhang - Churchill Capital","Okay. And could you tell me how many dividends would you expect to pay before the close of the deal?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it depends on the closing of the deal. We pay quarterly. So, you can see that we expect this deal to close within 12 months. So that would be the maximum you would expect. But I mean, we've \u2013 we can't guide on how long it's going to take us to go through the various regulatory authorities to consummate the merger. But we pay quarterly generally, right?","Han Zhang - Churchill Capital","Hi. This is Ramesh, Zhang's colleague. Have you had any informal discussions with any regulators at this point in time?","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","No. We haven't.","Han Zhang - Churchill Capital","Thank you.","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","","William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, looks like we are through the Q&A, operator. I just want to thank you for your flexibility, and again apologies for the short notice, but I think you can imagine that given the timing of achieving a positive result on the acquisition of Recall, we felt it was important to combine that with our earnings call which was originally scheduled for Thursday.","So, again, thank you very much for your flexibility, and just to reiterate that we're very pleased in terms of our results in the first quarter, continue to show real momentum in the operating performance and improvement in the business. And of course, we're very excited to finally end the speculation around Recall and to have agreed a proposal to acquire the company.

I will turn the call over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Cathy. Welcome. Good morning, everyone, to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This morning we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiative; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance.","After our prepared remarks we'll open up the phones for Q&A, and as we've done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations\/Financial Information.","Referring now to page two of the Supplemental, today's earnings call and slides will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's Supplemental, the earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.","In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this Supplemental reporting package.","With that, Bill, would you please begin?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results that in every respect met or exceeded our expectations in constant dollars, with reported EPS for the quarter beating expectations. Our results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business, even in these volatile times.","Total revenue in constant dollars was in line with our guidance and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA was at the upper end of our range. We continued to achieve solid growth in storage rental revenue, as well as consistent volume growth in new records from existing customers. We also achieved service gross margins in line with our year-end exit rate goal, as well as growth in adjusted OIBDA. All of these accomplishments resulted in a very good 2015.","I believe most of you are familiar with the strategic plan we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. To assist in tracking our progress against that plan we've modified the earnings commentary at the beginning of our supplemental disclosure to highlight key performance metrics. You'll note that in addition to our solid financial performance in 2015, we've made good progress against our objectives in each of the three pillars and in the foundational elements that support our strategy.","As anticipated, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to impact our reported revenue. However, when looking through to fundamental performance, we've achieved a significant turnaround in the business in the last two years. We've gone from negative internal growth in total revenue in both 2012 and 2013 to 1% positive internal growth, or prior to acquisitions in 2014.","And in 2015, we achieved further improvement with 1.5% positive internal growth. This is a testament to the hard work our organization has undertaken to, first, achieve net Records Management volume in all major markets, enhance customer service and retention whilst attracting new customers, stabilize service revenue declines in Records Management, penetrate new emerging markets and advancing adjacent business opportunities.","Turning to the pillars of our strategic plan in developed markets, our focus over the last two years on getting more growth from these regions has driven improved performance with positive internal storage growth, stabilizing Records Management service revenues and adding roughly three million cubic feet of net new records in 2015, prior to acquisitions.","In emerging markets, our revenue has grown from 10% of the total in 2013 to 14.6% of total revenue at the end of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. We have a sizable deal pipeline and are confident we will reach our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by 2016, and 20% by 2020. Importantly, we're driving internal growth in these markets of roughly 10% per year, so just two points of our 20% goal comes from acquisitions.","We resumed M&A activity in select emerging markets in the fourth quarter, closing on a transaction in India. We have adjusted our focus to account for Recall's footprint and expect to close a few transactions in the first half of 2016, including a couple in fast-growing new emerging markets with underserved demand for records management.","As we've noted in recent calls, despite the impact of the strong dollar on reported revenue, we mitigate our FX exposure at the income level because our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, and we are increasingly moving more of our debt outside the United States. The net of this is that we exceeded earnings expectations for the fourth quarter.","Additionally, using strong dollars to invest in high-growth markets outside the U.S. gives us a lower cost basis and sets us up to realize significant value creation as the economic growth in these markets, over the longer term, will typically outpace that of the United States.","I should note that in our Other International segment, which is emerging markets plus Australia, we did see a higher level of destructions in Q4 driven by a single large customer, which will carry over into Q1 of 2016. However, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that destructions for the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels. But we do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis and therefore this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters.","We also have a goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. Today, our adjacent businesses consist of our data center operations and our recently acquired art storage business. We closed on Crozier Fine Arts storage in December and are pleased with how it is being integrated into our business whilst retaining the DNA and key management talent that made it the leading art storage business in the United States. We believe the billion-dollar estimated global market is poised for the same type of consolidation opportunity we saw in the records management business years ago, and we have a plan that can take it to $100 million within three years.","We had a fairly aggressive goal for 2015 to finish with an adjacent business revenue run rate of $50 million from a starting point below $20 million. We achieved that with roughly a $20 million revenue run rate from our data center business and $30 million from art storage. This all supports our planned shift in mix by 2020 to have 25% of our revenue coming from both emerging markets and adjacent businesses that have internal growth rates closer to 10%, up from 15% of our revenue in these higher growth businesses today.","In terms of the foundational elements of our strategy, we have made significant progress on our Transformation initiative, effecting changes that have resulted in $50 million of net savings in 2016. We are finalizing the next set of initiatives that will deliver an additional $50 million of savings by year end 2016. As previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the Transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA.","Importantly, the cost to achieve these savings in each year is offset by the savings. As a reminder, we don't exclude the Transformation costs from our adjusted financial measures, but we do detail the amounts in the bridging schedules in the supplemental. Rod will have more on the timing of expected Transformation related costs to 2016 in a few minutes.","We continue to work toward closing of the Recall transaction and related integration planning. As outlined at our Investor Day, we have detailed workstreams for virtually every functional area of the combined companies, and I am pleased with what I am seeing in the way our teams are working together on integration planning to create a dynamic combined entity and facilitate a smooth transition.","Obviously, this transaction is compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive accretion. As we work through the regulatory process, we will refine our views based upon a clear understanding of the outcome. We are constructively engaged with the four principal regulators and are working hard towards closing the transaction in a timely manner.","As you know, it is necessary for us to close early in a given quarter in order to convert Recall's operations in certain countries into our REIT structure. We will provide updates with respect to the timetable when we have substantially completed the regulatory review process. But at this time, we cannot answer any questions about regulatory outcomes on today's call beyond what we have already said.","In addition, we view real estate as a foundation to our strategy. During the year, we invested roughly $171 million in real estate. We remain keenly focused on our capital allocation opportunity and think about real estate investment in four major buckets. Our first priority is to invest in growth racking to accommodate net new volume growth we achieve annually. This investment yields average IRRs in the high teens.","Our next priority is real estate consolidation, which may include both buildings and racking to improve real estate and operating efficiency and enhance utilization. This is characterized by mid-teens IRRs. Third, we plan to continue to invest in data center in a success-based manner driven by customer commitments. We continue to see good opportunity here with low double-digit IRRs and stabilized mid-teens return on invested capital. Fourth, we also look to complete select opportunistic lease buy-ins where we can acquire buildings at attractive valuations relative to market pricing or where it is strategically important to own. Rod will have more on how we view our real estate investment opportunities for the coming year.","Now touching on some key financial and operating achievements before turning it over to Rod. On a constant dollar basis, we grew total revenue in 2015 by 2%, reflecting continued storage rental gains of 4%. This was driven primarily by storage rental internal growth of 2.7% for the year, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look out into 2016, we are seeing consistent trends and maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range.","Service revenue growth for the year was negative 0.4%, and we delivered positive at 0.3% internal service growth revenue for the quarter. We made good progress on our service margin initiative, exiting the year at 27.2%, right in the middle of our range. There will be ups and downs as the mix shifts to more non-recurring projects and there will be a downtick in service margin early in the year, but we expect it to ramp up again throughout the year and to result in a similar average margin for the full year.","Also as previously mentioned, in 2016 we will also focus on growing overall service gross profit as we move forward and our service mix evolves. Although some of our new offerings have lower margins than our core activity base services such as transportation and handling, they are also less capital intensive, so they have very similar returns.","Storage volume growth is another important indicator in our business. During the year, we once again grew net worldwide storage volume by 8 million cubic feet or 2.3% net growth and 1.6% prior to acquisitions, and gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 42 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months.","Our customer retention remains strong at 98%, underscoring the stability of our customer base in supporting the durability of the storage revenue stream. This level has been stable over the past six quarters and represents an appropriate level in our business.","Lastly, and most importantly, our cash generation is an important metric as it supports growth in dividends and investment. In recent presentations, we laid out our expectations for cash available to support the dividend, both on a standalone basis and including Recall. We expect to fund additional growth through debt in amounts that allow us to continue to delever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis.","On a standalone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation program, will at a minimum allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018, whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Even with an increased dividend in Q4, we improved our year-end 2015 payout as a percentage of our AFFO from 82% at Investor Day to 78% at year end. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall.","Looking ahead, all of these drivers support our updated constant dollar guidance for 2016. On a like-for-like basis or comparing our 2016 constant dollar guidance with our 2015 results using 2016 FX budget rates, you can see our growth expectations are very consistent with what we showed at Investor Day. We expect 3% to 6% constant dollar growth in revenue, 6% to 8% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 6% to 13% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth is underpinned by nearly $1.5 billion of storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with an overview of our 2015 performance, including a review of results by segment and updates on our service gross margin initiative as well as our Transformation program. Finally, I will address our outlook for 2016, including a review of our capital allocation plans.","Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the full year, reported revenues were $3.01 billion, compared with $3.12 billion in 2014. Excluding the full year FX impact of 6% or $171 million year-over-year, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.1%. Consistent with the full-year picture, revenues for the fourth quarter also grew by 2.1% on a constant dollar basis.","As Bill noted, we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity for most of 2015, so our revenues for the year had a very limited contribution from external growth. Total revenues were driven by good constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Service revenues were flat for the quarter and down 1% for the year. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue for the year was driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia in late 2014.","Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter and the full year. These schedules are on pages 22 through 26 of the Supplemental.","Similar to last quarter, we have also provided a bridging schedule on page 27 to explain the sequential movement in our total service business gross margins. For our focused initiative we're continuing to align service costs with activity levels and revenue mix.","Looking ahead, we expect modest reductions in our service gross profits during Q1, reflecting one-off severance costs and the timing of costs related to our growing mix of special projects. However, we expect service margins will recover to current levels throughout the year.","Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $238 million, compared with $220 million in 2014. Despite FX headwinds, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 8% and excluding FX by 14%. For the full year adjusted OIBDA grew by 4.4% on a constant dollar basis.","As Bill noted, our Transformation program continues in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to incur roughly $7 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3, we expect the Transformation program to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA, with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. In Q4, we expect net upside of up to around $10 million, so providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. As Bill noted, we continue to expect run rate savings of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for Transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018.","Looking at the overall phasing of contribution for 2016, we expect this to ramp up during the year for two reasons. Firstly, as I just discussed, the costs associated with our Transformation program are front loaded, with offsetting net benefits coming later in the year. Secondly, our storage volumes and revenues will grow through the year as they typically do. As such, excluding any extraordinary events, we believe that Q1 adjusted OIBDA will represent roughly 21% to 23% total adjusted OIBDA, factored in 2016. Furthermore Q2 and Q3 will make up roughly 24% to 26% each and Q4 will represent roughly 26% to 28%.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33, compared with $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.21, compared with $1.36 for 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by an 8% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014 following our REIT conversion, charges related to Transformation, and a high structural tax rate for the year. Including the increase in share count and restructuring costs in both periods as well as holding the tax rate constant, normalized adjusted EPS grew by $0.02 for the year.","Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out as 16.8%, compared with 14.4% in the prior year and 16.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 17% in the short-term.","Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter compared with $0.52 in the year ago period, driven by improved performance. For the full year, FFO per share was $2.10 per share compared with $2.28 in 2014. The decline was driven by FX headwinds, the increase in share count as well as restructuring charges related to our Transformation program. Including share count increases, FX and restructuring charges in both periods, FFO per share grew by 3%.","Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $125 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $112 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, AFFO was $522 million compared with $527 million in 2014. If we adjust for FX in the items mentioned earlier that impacted FFO, except for share counts, then AFFO grew by 3% year-on-year. On page 21 of the Supplemental, we're now providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statements, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of a typical recurring nature.","Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was up 0.2% for the fourth quarter and 0.1% for the full year. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to the continued decrease in transportation, retrieve and re-file activity levels. In addition, we saw more of a precipitous decline in average price of recycled sorted office paper towards the end of the year, leading to a decline of over 19% quarter-over-quarter in average pricing. This impacted the paper revenue in our shred business and will have a follow-on impact into 2016.","Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 41% for the quarter and 40% for the year, up from 39% in 2014. The year-over-year improvement in North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins is driven by the service gross margin actions and better operational performance.","North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.0% for the fourth quarter and 4.2% for the year. The growth in DM storage rental internal growth for the quarter was lower than recent periods due to a strong comparator from Q4 last year. Looking forward, we expect DM internal storage growth to be in line with the growth in total company storage internal growth around 2.5%.","Internal service revenue in DM declined by 8% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the year, as we continued to see declines in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the fourth quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 53.7%, compared to 51.6% in Q3. For the full year, DM adjusted OIBDA margins are 52.2%. We expect DM adjusted OIBDA margins will remain in the low to mid-50% range as we continue to invest in new service offerings. Margins on new services, although high at 35% to 40%, are lower than core storage margins of approximately 75%.","The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 2.4% internal storage rental growth for the quarter and 2.7% for the year. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remain solid in Western Europe at 33.1% for the quarter and 34.4% for the year.","The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% for the quarter and 10.8% for the year. Service internal growth was 8.4% for the quarter and 9.0% for the year.","Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 23% for the quarter and 21% for the year. We expect to see adjusted OIBDA from this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in a low 20s% range in the short-term as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets.","Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. To prepare for integration, in 2015, we incurred approximately $25 million of deal close costs and $22 million to prepare for integration, which brings total Recall related costs in 2015 to $47 million.","For the first quarter of 2016, we expect $5 million to $8 million of deal close costs and $8 million to $12 million of integration related costs, bringing the total costs in Q1 to roughly $15 million to $20 million. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are one time in nature. Importantly, these costs were outlined in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.","Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 13 of the Supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent and operationally we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. Please note I'm referring to the corrected version of the Supplemental that was posted just prior to the call.","Our guidance for 2016 growth on a constant dollar basis remains fairly consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call. We made two changes. Firstly, we updated our outlook to reflect the new constant dollar budget foreign exchange rates which was set in January 2016. Note that at this point, that our 2016 constant dollar budget rate is now equivalent to an R (sic) [reported] dollar rate since it was just set last month. Secondly, we have reduced revenue and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $10 million at the midpoint as a result of the decline in the shred recycled paper prices that I noted earlier. Revenue from paper recycling is almost all margin, and so the vast majority flows through to adjusted OIBDA.","To provide further clarity, I'd now like to share with you additional detail of how FX has impacted 2016 guidance and walk you through the components of our expected 2016 adjusted OIBDA growth on a constant dollar basis. The FX headwind was primarily driven by significant declines against U.S. dollar in the following five currencies: Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and the euro. These represent about 28% of our total revenue. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our total revenues are denominated in non-U.S. dollars.","Assuming our 2016 FX rates remain constant throughout the year, our guidance reflects a 5% decline in revenues from FX. In our Investor Day, we had anticipated a decline of 3.5% based on rates at that time. Given continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, our outlook represents an additional decline by the end of the year of 1.5%. This total decline translate into roughly $165 million for the year on the top line.","As we move down the P&L, FX headwinds continue to impact our guidance, albeit at a lower dollar amount. The FX headwinds impacting the top line translates into approximately $50 million on adjusted OIBDA for 2016. As you can see on page 12 of the Supplemental, we reported constant dollar 2015 adjusted OIBDA of $940 million at 2015 constant dollar budget rates set in January 2015. When our 2015 numbers are translated into 2016 budget rates, adjusted OIBDA would've been $900 million. However, we're also expecting an additional impact related to FX of roughly $10 million as a result of a change in our contribution mix.","As we noted earlier, we are also expecting a $10 million constant dollar impact from paper price declines. On a more positive note, we can add a $50 million benefit from Transformation. Adding all that up, we get to adjusted OIBDA for 2016 based on January 2016 rates of roughly $930 million. Adding onto that our expectation of roughly 2% to 4% constant dollar growth will get you the $950 million to $970 million, which is our 2016 guidance range.","Lastly, moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investments for 2016, we expect it to be roughly $495 million at the midpoint for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds for our core gross racking investment.","Let's turn to our capital deployment plans. We expect our capital expenditures, which include maintenance and non real estate investment to be in line with the ranges we provided at our Investor Day. Real estate investment spend is expected to be about $265 million, driven by growth racking spend of about $60 million, data center investment of $35 million. We also plan on investing $170 million in real estate consolidation and lease conversions. For M&A our plan is roughly $100 million in emerging markets and $50 million in the developed markets.","Our dividend expectation also remains consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. As you saw last week, we announced our first quarter dividend of $0.485 per share, which is consistent with the $1.94 per share run rate from Q4 last year when we increased the quarterly rate by $0.01 per share. In addition, the $1.94 per share is the minimum projected dividend for 2016 in a combined basis with Recall. Importantly, we ended the year with a dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO of 78%, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage.","Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the year-end we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.6 times, as expected.","Before concluding, I'd like to point out that we are updating our shelf registration statement with the SEC. You will likely see this filing next week. Please note that this update is part of our regular cycle. As we've said in the past, at this time we don't plan on issuing equity to fund investments outside the potential Recall acquisition.","Overall, we've delivered good results for the year, supported by continued execution on our strategic plan, progress we've made in our Transformation initiative as well as the stabilization of our service gross margins.","Looking ahead, we're well positioned to deliver on our short and long-term goals. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends in core growth investments.","And with that, I'll hand back to Bill to sum up.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Rod. Before going over to questions, just to sum up, by utilizing the levers available to us in this highly durable and cash generative business, we've been able to deliver a good year, which is distinguished by first demonstrating growth in the business, both with and without acquisitions; additionally by generating cash, which allows us to grow dividend whilst at the same time establishing a debt-to-EBITDA glide path which delevers over time; and finally by investing in our core business whilst building adjacencies which support the business well into the future.","With that, I'd like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Just to say it very clearly, the only change in the 2016 guidance relative to the last time we spoke was FX and paper prices, right?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep. That's right.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. I wanted to dive a little bit into tape services decline. I know this is not a new thing in terms of frequency of rotation. But the decline, this is North American tape, was larger this time. What's your anticipation in sort of getting to that bottom of that cycle in terms of frequency? And how do you think the service side of tape will do this year?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. No, I think it's pretty much the same as we said I think on the last call. I think it's bouncing between kind of the high-single-digit to low-double-digit declines in terms of what I would say our core service revenue associated with the transport of the tapes. And I think as we called out the last few quarters is that where we were on the paper record side of the business maybe two or three years ago, we're still watching that till it starts flattening out or we see the inflection point. And we don't see that inflection point right now, but at the same time we don't see it getting worse than what it is.","I think what you'll see is, you'll see some bouncing around in terms of the net service revenue on the data management. I mean, quite frankly, I think we've done a pretty good job on building up some of these new service lines that in the tape management which includes the secured IT asset destruction business, for instance, and also the restoration assurance business, just to call out two.","So on the transportation side, again, which is our highest margin in that type of business, we don't see a slowdown in that decline, but we don't see an acceleration either. But I think what we're -we're making some good progress in some of these new services which generally have lower margins than transport, but at the same time they have much less invested capital associated with it, so we're getting similar returns. So when those \u2013 I wouldn't expect this year that these new services are going to overtake the decline that we're seeing in the transportation, but we're making good progress.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Right. And then if you don't mind, I'm just going to ask about Western Europe. Service has really popped up in the quarter. Is there something there that really is unusual for the quarter? And how do you feel like we're entering the year on service side of Western Europe?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think it's a good call-out, Andrew. I think one of the things you probably caught in my remarks and a little bit in Rod's is that as we're shifting from the core transportation services that are associated with the ins and outs in our storage business to some of the new service areas, a lot of these new service areas are project based, which is also the reason why we said we expect kind of a downtick in Q1 in some of our service revenue as those projects have a lead time in terms of the sell and onboarding those cycles. And then they come through it in the next quarter or quarters and that's what you've seen actually in Western Europe.","What you will have seen is there was an investment earlier in the year, and then that project revenue kind of flows through. So that's part of the new services. It's less smooth than say the transportation side of the business, so you have these ups and downs. So what we tend to do is we look at it over the course of the year and it just so happened that in Western Europe, you saw that spike as part of that normal cyclicality of these projects.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","All right. And if you'll let me sneak just one last in, so when you think about service side total for 2016, do you feel like it's going to solidify it more like we saw in the fourth quarter? Would that be the right word, solidifying services revenue?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think what we said is that we expect looking at the pipeline that we will have a similar margin by the end of the year as we achieved in 2015. So that's correct. And what you'll see is that we were, in Q4, we had positive service revenue growth overall in the year, slightly negative. So what we expect is service revenue to be basically flat and the margin to be in line, maybe slightly ahead, but it's going to be basically in line with what we achieved at the end of 2015.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that's right. It might move around a little bit by a quarter, but I think that's actually right, Bill, for the full year. It's a good summary.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Morning. I'd like to go a little bit into the services business as well. Can you elaborate on the timing of internal initiatives that you think can drive upside or improvement in services' internal growth in 2016 versus 2015?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, so good morning, George. So I think there's kind of a couple aspects. There's some that \u2013 there's a number of things that you're touching upon or referring to that Patrick Keddy went through on Investor Day, things that we're doing just to get more margin out of some of our existing core service areas which have seen a drop in activity, so that's really around the transportation side. And I think we feel pretty good where that's coming out.","I think you'll continue to see some improvement during the course of the year, but a lot of that is in flight. I think the bigger part of it is how we bring on some of the new service areas which are less smooth, but on a year basis these are project-driven. So you can think of it as like a defense contractor: there's a certain amount of prospecting and then there's a certain amount of reaping or harvesting. So you'll see on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you'll see some movement around that, but we have good visibility over the course of the year to be able to predict where the year will end up.","So I think what you can expect as we go through the course of the year is we think that we will have similar slight uptick in terms of where we came in for the year in 2015, so slight improvement, but kind of in the same postal code for 2016 in service. But you will see as we shift away from the volume coming from almost exclusively the transportation side of the business to some of these new services that are more project based, you will see more ups and downs on a quarter-by-quarter basis just like Andrew called out for the uptick in Western Europe in Q4. And we're saying that Q1 you'll see a downtick in some of those services, but we have very good visibility over the course of the year where we'll come out.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Thanks. And looking at C$ revenue growth for the quarter and year, it came in a little bit below target because of lower M&A activity given your focus on Recall. You talked a little bit about your expected M&A activity in the first quarter. But with Recall still in progress, can you update us on how you're approaching your tuck-in M&A strategy for the full year?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So there's kind of two dimensions to that, right, George. So one is now that we've gone through quite a bit of the integration process, not on the commercial side, but we kind of know the people and the overall volumes that we're getting in different geographies, we have a pretty high confidence level of where it makes sense for us to continue to bolster our presence internationally. So that's kind of one dimension. So you saw for instance our acquisition the last quarter of last year in India. And there's a couple more in flight that are in, as we called out, in the emerging markets, right.","The other aspect of that, of course, is you won't see us doing any M&A activity in the four regulatory jurisdictions that we're working with right now to close the Recall transaction because we don't want any delay in those discussions with the regulators, right. Because if you start doing acquisitions at the same time you're having discussions, it's just going to delay it. So we have pretty good visibility now where it makes sense. And that's why we've restarted the engine.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that's right, Bill. I think, George that was in the nature of deals, particularly internationally, it can be a bit lumpy in terms of when they land. It was relatively quiet last year as you rightly pointed out. But I can see a reasonable amount of activity in Q1 actually with some, well I think, pretty exciting deals.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Did we lose you, Kevin?","Operator","Kevin, your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we got you, Kevin. Yep.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I apologize. Sorry about that, I was on mute. Apologize. Hey, so in terms of any updated timing on Recall? Do you still see it as Q2 type event? Or does that get pushed out a little bit based on \u2013 just any updates on that if you can to the extent you can provide further clarity on discussions with the regulators before? Just any thoughts around that?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kevin, I think you were covering us during the PLR, no?","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think you probably know how I'm going to answer this one. As I said in my notes, it's not much that I can say beyond \u2013 or anything I can say beyond in my remarks. So I think you could probably appreciate that...","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Sure.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But we remain excited about the deal. As I said on my prepared remarks is that we're engaged constructively with the four key regulators, and we're working hard to drive this to a close. But I can't \u2013 I think you could probably appreciate I can't say much more.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I figured I'd try, Bill.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I knew someone was going to try; I just didn't know who it was.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Would you give updates based on country? Or would it be when it's all done?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, right now I think all four are \u2013 we're engaged in all four, so I think our expectation is it'll probably be coming together pretty much at the same time. I mean, I wouldn't rule out a country-by-country update, but I think right now my expectation is it's going to be fairly closely aligned.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","That's helpful. And then just \u2013 it looks like you tightened up the range a little bit on the on the internal growth for 2016. You took the low end up 50 bps, the high end down 50 bps, am I reading that right in terms of the notes? And then if that is right, what drove king of the tightening of that range?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Rod, do you want to...","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't think we've mentioned change in internal growth. This may be in total growth. And so the internal \u2013 it's only if we start with internal storage growth, we've always been sort of in the 2.5% to 3% range and, obviously, that's the key metric for us. On the total revenue outlook, you're right. I think we've sort of pulled it in slightly as a result of just having a better understanding of how things might pan out.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Awesome. And then are you at the point now where the sorted office \u2013 is the pricing still decremental? Or is it a point where it's stabilized, the sorted office paper?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It looks like it could've stabilized, but we've seen that before. So effectively what we've done in terms of our projection, we've taken the paper price out of that January. It could continue to move up or down, and we'll obviously keep updating on that, but where we did see the drop was really in the last couple of months of last year.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Awesome. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions. Could you just give us a little bit of color as to some of the service projects, the nature of those projects that are causing things to kind of go up and down, become a little bit more lumpy? Just a practical on the ground, what exactly are you guys doing? And then afterwards, can you just give us an update on the EMC partnership announcement last April and how that's moving?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Morning, Shlomo. I'll just give you kind of a couple examples that give you an idea. Some of them are large scanning projects, so there's some that are in flight with government contracts for instance, and they have a certain \u2013 that's why I kind of alluded to kind of like defense contracts, those things have a kind of a tilling, fertilizing, seeding process and then a harvesting side. And those are typically very large scanning projects that are associated with storage. So we're not going in to compete with an ACS or a Xerox per se.","I mean, they may be competing, but we're going after contracts where we think we really have a strong skill set that's associated with just not the scanning, but also the classification of the records and in many if not most cases the actual storing of those records. But those are long lead time projects that come through at different times and hence you see the kind of spike that we saw in Western Europe when those things come through.","Others are, again, what I would call kind of BPM-type projects that are associated with storage. So right now we have in sight a large project which is associated with mortgage servicing or helping mortgage originator to process and manage a lot of their documentation and processes associated with mortgages. Again, there's a big upfront piece and we have the relationship with that customer because we do, if not all, most of their storage. So those are kind of two different projects. One which I would typically call BPM, and the other one I would call scanning, but we come at it, and we've been asked to come in and provide these services because of our expertise around records management and record storage.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And the EMC...","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. On the EMC, so the EMC we're still very excited. We're making good steady progress, and the great thing about it is there's still a high level of engagement, even though you can probably imagine that EMC is going through their own changes right now with the Dell acquisition. But even with all that and through that process both pre and post announcement, we've had a high level of engagement and both teams are working well.","I mean, it's starting on a small base, but we're very excited about that combination because to us this is kind of like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, right. It's putting \u2013 I don't know if you could say who has the peanut butter and who has the chocolate, but putting those two things together and combining it with our raised floor platform using the data center is just a \u2013 it's a really unique platform that we could offer to our customers, which it's very difficult for any competitors to do because we're allowing customers to remove both the OpEx and CapEx associated with their tape drives in their premises and using EMC's market-leading technology or data domain technology.","We can replicate their data center on our raised floor using our data center technology, and then deliver tapes off the back of that and store it in our vault, which is a perfect cyber-security play because I think what people have learned is that you're not secure around cyber-security unless you unplug it completely from any network, so that's where tape comes in. But at the same time, people can get rid of a lot of the OpEx and CapEx costs associated with cutting the tapes themselves, and you reduce the need to transport these things over the road, and many cases these tapes aren't encrypted. So that adds a much more secure environment.","And then the other service of course we apply to that is we tell the customer, independent of any change in generational tape drives, we give them guaranteed assurance that we will restore that data whenever they need it in whatever format they need. So if you kind of look at some of the things that are in the core DNA of Iron Mountain, together with our growing data center business, and the core DNA of EMC, it is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Are there any marquee clients yet that you guys are willing to name or you're allowed to name or that you obtained, but you can't name?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, at this point you could imagine because this really goes to the IT security of most of our customers, none of them \u2013 I mean, we keep working on that, and when we can we'll highlight them. I think I should highlight, it's still a relatively small portion of our revenue. But we're really excited about these types of programs because it really resonates with our customers. But I think you can imagine most of our customers are pretty secretive about the way that they manage their IT assets or IT information.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. For Rod, given the movements in currency and everything, are you able to maybe just give us a little guidance on the certain base rate percentage move in each of the currency that you highlighted, what that impact would be to both revenue and OIBDA up and down? So strengthening a certain \u2013 1% against the dollar impacts revenue by X and impacts OIBDA by X, just so that from a technical modeling perspective we can get that rate?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and probably the easiest thing to do, if you take it as 40% of our revenue as outside of the U.S. and so therefore if you kind of take a 1% delta on the dollar against the basket of currencies, that would impact our revenue by 0.4%. And then you can flow that down to OIBDA. I think the way to think about that is if the FX movement is against markets where our businesses are more mature, so I could say for example, Canada and the UK, there obviously we earn higher margins. And so it has a sort of disproportionate effect on OIBDA. If the FX movement is against some of our businesses in emerging markets, it tends to be more dampened at the OIBDA level because obviously they're at earlier stages, and so the contribution margin percent is lower. Don't know if that helps.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I mean, percentage of revenue helps more than that, but as much as you can give us, we'll take.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that's probably what I can give you.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ellman, with Mayo Capital Partners.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could just offer me a bit of clarification about the guidance summary on page 13 of the document. I'm not sure that I understood all of Rod's remarks. Do I understand that your guidance for adjusted OIBDA for 2016 is the $950 million to $970 million range that I see in the second column from the right?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yeah, that's exactly right. So page 13, it's the second last column on the right is our 2016 guidance based at January 2016 FX rates. So...","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","January 2016 FX rates?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, exactly. So that's...","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Okay.","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...our best view of guidance as we sit here...","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","All right. So just sort of taking the midpoint of that range, that would be $960 million, and then you present your estimated capital allocation at $555 million to $595 million?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Okay. And your dividend obligation is currently about $412 million at the $1.94 rate?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Okay. So the dividend obligation, plus the midpoint of the capital allocation guidance would be $987 million?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Okay. And so in your guidance for adjusted OIBDA you've obviously excluded the anticipated going forward expenses for the Recall consolidation which you've estimated at $15 million to $20 million?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","And so are there any other foreseeable expenses that, being one-time in nature, you're also excluding from your estimate of adjusted OIBDA?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. No. So we have restructuring costs, but they're actually included within adjusted OIBDA, but they have a phasing impact as I referred to earlier.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Okay. All right, I guess that would be it. Could you possibly clarify in your capital allocation estimate of business and customer acquisitions of $140 million to $180 million, how much is acquisitions of business and how much is the money that you invest when you establish a new contract with customers?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's really our M&A spend, so that's \u2013 we refer to business customer acquisitions, but it's really the M&A spend.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think the way you should think about it is that \u2013 I think I understand where you're kind of going with it, is that if you're trying to bring it down to cash available for distribution and investment, is that...","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","That would be fair.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Okay. So that's what I figured you were trying to get to. So if you look at 2016 and you take the midpoint of the guidance, you should get to $495 million, and then you had $412 million for the dividend, I mean, it's $411 million, $412 million. So you subtract that out and then there's about $65 million for growth racking, but that is actually for growth. So actually if you think about it, it's the $495 million less the $411 million and then that gives you a number that's available for growth basically, for investment and growth. And so the first call in that cash available is $65 million, which is for the organic growth that we get from our customers every year.","So even if you take out, and that's for 2017 revenue if you know what I mean, right, because you're putting the racking investment in 2016, so that when the growth hits you in 2017 you can actually put those boxes on the shelf.","So then even after you take the growth racking which gives you the mid-2% range that we highlighted in terms of internal growth, in terms of our storage business that leaves you about $19 million for cash available for discretionary investment. Now, that's versus 2015 actuals of about $3 million left over after you paid for racking. So we've actually \u2013 even with the further FX headwinds coming into the 2016 based on January rates, you see the improvement from $3 million to $19 million, but again, that's also already including $65 million for growth, so that 2.5% organic storage volume growth that's coming in.","Now when you come down and you're trying to \u2013 to your point about M&A is \u2013 so you say: well, how are we able to delever and still be able to do M&A? Because of course when we're doing the M&A we're buying EBITDA as well associated with that. So we're \u2013 so that's how the whole thing works. So we are issuing debt to do the M&A because obviously $19 million doesn't fuel our whole M&A program. But between the $19 million that we have for beyond internal growth of storage, we also borrow, but on a net-net basis in terms of what it does is debt-to-EBITDA you see a deleveraging as well. So that...","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Is there a debt-to-EBITDA target that you have, say, for the end of 2016? I think you said you were at 5.6 times currently?","Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","5.6 I think, and we aim to hold it around that level, it would be 5.5 times to 5.6 times by the end of the year. And over the next three years it will come down to 5.2, excluding the Recall deal. If we did the Recall deal, actually allows us to delever faster than that.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the only thing I would do is just one last thing, Michael, is if you go to our Investor Day deck it lays it out quite well because it shows you what happens to \u2013 we do it both on a standalone and with Recall, but it shows you how we grow dividends during that period of time, how we grow the M&A and how we delever during the period of time. And you'll see the cash available or the CAD in the appendix of that deck.","Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC","Okay, thank you.","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Do we have any closing remarks?","William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think that's it, operator. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."]}}
