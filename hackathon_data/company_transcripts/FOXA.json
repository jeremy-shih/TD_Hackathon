Welcome to the Twenty-First Century Fox Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, Operator. Hello everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and year and we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The Company's Form 10-K for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and the reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-K filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks Reed, good afternoon everyone. As you can see from today's earnings release, we have delivered a solid fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues in both our domestic and international businesses, as well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite continued foreign exchange headwinds and a particularly difficult comparison, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA and revenues for the year. ","But before James and I provide further commentary on our financial results, let me first say a few words about Fox News which has been the news over recent weeks. Two weeks ago we received and accepted Roger Ailes' resignation as the CEO of the business, and our father took up the responsibility of leading Fox News as Chairman and acting CEO. Throughout this process, we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, to protect its employees and to protect a unique and important voice, Fox News Broadcast. ","There is no one more dedicated or more able to transition Fox News to new leadership than its founder. As acting CEO, he joins an existing team that is extraordinarily strong and equally devoted to its success. The Fox News Channel is on track to have its highest rated year ever and has lead all of basic cable in both primetime and total day for three full months this calendar year.","In fact, 2016 has been a pivotal year for the entire company. We executed well against our strategic objectives delivering standout creative output, advancing innovation for customers and further driving improvements and how we monetize our content. We have managed succession at both the top of the company and in our divisions, allowing us to drive fundamental changes throughout the business. From the film studio to the network, from National Geographic to Star TV, across all our businesses, we are intensely focused on capturing the valuable opportunities that new technologies and emerging mediums present us. And these opportunities are significant. Downstream innovation has meaningfully increased both choice and consumption for consumers.","Demand for premium content including live sports, news and scripted entertainment has never been stronger. In this environment, value will continue to accrue to the strongest video brands and to the distinctive story telling that defines Fox. The strengthening of our talent brands has been at the center of our strategy. Over the last couple of years, increased programming investment across our portfolio, as well as the launches of FSX, Fox Sports 1 and Star Sports are now bearing fruit.","The dividends these investments are yielding are clear. As our core brands are fundamental to emerging streaming services like Sony and Sling TV, as well as Hulu's forthcoming service, which we expect will launch early next year. These services understand and value the emergence of the core bundle that our brands underpin. These and other emerging platforms will aggregate the best channels at reduced cost, offering unsurpassed user experience and economics to the consumer while substantially increasing the number of distributors competing for our content.","And today we are excited to welcome Time Warner to Hulu as a shareholder. Since developing that year of Hulu 10 years ago, Hulu has grown from strength to strength and now serves over 11 million subscribers. Time Warner's investment is a testament to all that the Hulu business has achieved, and we are confident Time Warner's brand will play an important role in Hulu's ongoing success. ","The handful of content creators with the [indiscernible] that we have clearly have the advantage in a world where technological innovation is opening the door for new distribution. In 2016, we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently create content that delivers audience and acclaim. For example, our film studio set on a first time director broke a box-office record with Deadpool which gross $760 million on a modest production budget. ","Our television studio delivered three of the season's top four broadcast series, and we are recognized with a total of 144 Emmy nominations across primetime and sports. But I'd be remiss if I didn't also recognize that while you need to measure the film business over a multi-year cycle, the recent three sequels we released clearly fell short of the expectations we had going into them. It is our goal to be far more consistent with this output. ","As I said earlier, the opportunities ahead of us are significant, and the pursuing and participating in these opportunities we view our balance sheet underpinned by our strong credit rating to be a strategic asset of the company to be deployed towards the highest long-term return initiatives. With that in mind, today we announced a 20% increase to our annualized dividend and an additional buyback authorization of $3 billion. ","However, we will be highly selective on the deployment of capital towards this authorization over the next 12 months. Our priority and how we annually allocate our capital will be to invest in a creative long-term growth opportunities. To investing in our existing business, new initiatives or acquisitions with both financial and strategic benefits. We are very focused on using our capital toward sustained long-term growth. But to the extent that opportunities do not emerge, we have the flexibility to use excess cash towards buybacks as we did with the $8 billion we received from the sale of the Sky businesses.","I'll now turn it over to John.","John Nallen","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with the full year financial results focusing on total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA which excludes in the prior year the DBS businesses we sold to Sky. ","For the full year, total adjusted revenues were $27.3 billion, up 1% over last year, and up 4% excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange. These increase were from higher revenues at both our cable networks and television segments partially offset by reductions at our film business. ","Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $6.6 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago, led by the cable network segment, partially offset by lower results at our film segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $380 million and reduced our growth rate by six percentage points.Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $2.8 billion or $1.42 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.73 this year compared to last year's $1.72.","Now turning to the fourth quarter results. Revenues increased 7% over last year and we're up 9% excluding foreign exchange led by double-digit growth at our cable network segment. Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.45 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago which primarily reflects the expected lower contributions from our film segment in an approximately $50 million negative impact from foreign exchange which contributed over half of the quarterly decline.","From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.30 in the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS was $0.45, up $0.15 from the comparable $0.39 last year. Included in this year's adjusted result is a $0.07 per share tax benefit resulting from a ruling we received. ","So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the fourth quarter, starting with the cable network segment. The total segment EBITDA of $1.2 billion was basically even with last year on revenue growth of 10%. Excluding an approximately $40 million negative impact from currency rates, segment EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter. ","Domestic cable revenues increased 10% in total, from affiliate fee growth of 6% and 13% advertising growth. The advertising growth reflect higher ratings and pricing at Fox News and our National Sports Channel, as well as a two percentage point benefit from this year's consolidation of the acquired National Geographic Businesses. ","EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by contractual sports right increases and streaming rights costs at the RSNs, higher political costs at Fox News and the inclusion of approximately $25 million of EBITDA losses from the recently acquired NatGeo Businesses, principally resulting from acquisition related items recorded during this quarter.","Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues grew 10%, driven by a 9% increase in reported affiliate revenues which were up 19% excluding currency impacts. Reported international advertising revenues were 6% lower than last year as negative foreign currency movements more than offset low single-digit local advertising growth. Additionally, content revenues doubled, reflecting this indication of soccer rights and the Outcast series outside of our markets. ","Reported international EBITDA decreased 25% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenue offset by cost from new sports rights, digital expansion initiatives and increased marketing. The international EBITDA decline reduces by half when factoring out the negative impact of currency movements. ","Turning to our television segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $31 million above last year, largely reflecting a 9% increase in the Fox Broadcast Network's entertainment advertising revenues from higher pricing, as well as increased non-linear and retransmission consent revenues. These revenue gains were partially offset by increased entertainment programming and marketing expenses. At the film segment, we reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $164 million, $105 million below last year. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the inclusion of significant releasing costs for the newest X-Men, Independence Day and Ice Age theatrical releases, as well as Mike and Dave.","From a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $4.4 billion in cash and approximately $19.7 billion in debt. During the fiscal year, we delivered $5.5 billion in capital returns to shareholders, and as of today we completed slightly over 90% of our $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We expect to complete the balance of this authorization over the year. The absolute level of capital returns to shareholders has been robust over the last three years, well-exceeding our annual cash flow generation and has us now sitting at the upper limit of our stated gross set target of 2.5 to 3 times. ","So as we look to fiscal 2017, there were a few items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. At our cable networks, we have 15% to 20% of our domestic subscriber base coming up for renewal annually over the next couple of years with the next round of renewals scheduled for early calendar 2017. Therefore, the pace of our domestic affiliate fee rate growth should accelerate in the back half of our fiscal year. ","On the cable network's cost side, while we don't have any major news sports right kicking in next year, we'll have the extra five months of expenses from the acquired NatGeo businesses, and as James will discuss we'll invest around $200 million toward the refresh of the NatGeo Global Programming and the expansion of original series at FX.","Turning to the television segment. The upcoming year's revenue and costs will be influenced by two main factors, our broadcast of Super Bowl LI and the Election Cycle. Excluding the Super Bowl, segment expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single digit range led by planned increases, international sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the Fox Network to support a higher volume of new series.","Aggregate retransmission revenues are expected to continue to grow at a low double-digit annual pace. Additionally, as of today except for Sterling, spot rates for the major currencies that we operate in are roughly similar for the average exchange rates we experienced for the entirety of fiscal 2016. On its phase, if this rates hold for the full year that would suggest a nominal impact from foreign exchange on our fiscal '17 full year EBITDA results. At the moment, the most significant impact to our results from the decline in Sterling would be our translation of Sky's equity earnings. ","So two final items to call out. First, our reported tax rate is expected to approach the full U.S. statutory rate next year. And second, as Lachlan mentioned, today we increased our dividend and announced the new buyback authorization of $3 billion which is open-ended as to its timeframe and we'll be very selective in deploying [ph] over the next 12 months.","And with that, let me turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and hello to all of you and thanks again for joining us. We made a lot progress over the last year, but much remains to be done. I wanted to just highlight a few key things and give you a sense of what we're super focused on and then we can cover whatever you want in the Q&A after. ","First of all, as I said last quarter, we want to make our programming and products more available not less, and we want to grow our capabilities in monetizing these brands and programs with our partners. And we want to enable our customer experience for our viewers that is truly simple and great. Our work with Hulu is a key part of this as is our licensing to other MVPDs over the top or otherwise. We want to be flexible in our approach though to deliver the best experience to customers and the most value to our partners and shareholders. ","Our progress, just last year, puts us in a strong position in this regard. Our focus on product innovation and on insuring our brands and content to new services as they proliferate our drivers of future growth. But it's fair to say that across the board from our organization structure to our commercial capability from creative investment to talent recruitment, we're moving at a fast pace today and are focused on improving our operations worldwide. We've restructured the leadership team at Fox Networks Group, embarked on leadership transition at the field studio, streamlined the cost space across the business, completed the integration of the three Skies, completed the integration of the newly acquired National Geographic businesses, completed the acquisition and integration of [indiscernible] and completed and integrated Shine into the new Endemol Shine Group.","Now this past year we've seen a flurry of MNA activity in the sector, and I want to be clear, please pay attention to what we've chosen and choose not to do. While we never rule out opportunities to invest inorganically, we've set a high bar with respect to how we intend to use capital and that bar will remain high.","In this coming year, while we certainly have challenges, we couldn't be more excited about where these businesses are and what they can achieve. Fox Sports is looking forward to one of its best years ever. We start the year with strong ratings for baseball at the RSNs and we expect this NFL season including Super Bowl LI on Fox to be as good as ever. And Fox Sports 1 already having overtaken ESPN2 in prime across all demos including total viewers is just starting to hit its stride.","A full revamp of the National Geographic Channel's creative output starting in this autumn and continuing with mega documentary, One Strange Rock, and scripted programming like The Upcoming Genius. Early response from advertisers and critics couldn't be more enthusiastic as we start to see with a fully aligned business, organized around a global super brand like National Geographic is capable of.","At FX, we're expanding from 15 to 18 original scripted series. These include Atlanta from Donald Glover; Taboo with Tom Hardy; Legion which is set in the X-Men universe and is created by Fargo show runner Noah Hawley; and Trust from the Slumdog Millionaire team of Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson. ","It's clear we have work to do at the film studio. Some of our major releases as Lachlan did not meet expectations, and that means we're starting the year with a bit of a hill decline. So we're energized about our upcoming pipeline with releases such as Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children, War of the Planet of the Apes, Kingsman 2, Assassin's Creed, Hidden Figures and Birth of a Nation, all in the next 12 months. Just as work has accelerated and a much anticipated next installment of Jim Cameron's Avatar.","Profit gross at Star in India is accelerating. The business is in rude health and the peak investment years are behind us as profitability towards our target progresses. We'll continue to invest in Hotstar, our over the top mobile video service, with over $50 million active users currently, we see this is a key opportunity to achieve real leadership in an important category. In addition, we plan to expand its service beyond India this year targeting the global South Asian Diaspora.","Sky in its three European markets is making great progress as the business broadens, opens up new customer segments and develops more products and services growing its customer base, revenues and profits. And domestically Hulu's velocity is picking up too. With over 11 million paying subs and exciting new live on demand service set to launch in early '17. With Disney, Time Warner, Fox and more to come, participating in this groundbreaking new product, we're very excited about Hulu's future. And we also saw strong advertising demand in this year's upfront with revenue growth driven by healthy pricing and volume increases across broadcast and cable. We also expect to build upon last year's momentum in non-linear advertising gains. ","So in summary, it's an exciting time. The vibrant downstream market is emerging which will help drive affiliate income and advertising innovation in the future. The overall TV advertising picture is healthy. Our creative output is strong, notwithstanding some disappointments in the film company. ","And lastly, the most importantly, the talent inside the businesses is tremendous and focused on delivering growth. In an era of constant change are -- for the status quo is our greatest strength.","Now we'd like to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. Good afternoon. James, just picking up on India. Can you give us a sense for what Star delivered in the fiscal year that just closed as we think about that $500 million target that you've laid out for '18, are you still unfazed for that? And just going back to the film studio if you don't mind, I think you guys had your toughest years since '11 in terms of EBITDA contribution. What are you doing among the things you can control or impact, what are you and the team doing at the studio to try to improve profitability there, acknowledging that obviously it's a hedge-driven business and there's a creative element to all of this stuff? Thank you.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Ben. So first of all on Star, look fiscal '16 was very strong, actually as you know in the previous year we invested 100% of the profit to the business, the entertainment business into the growth of the sports business, but that's really turned now. So for this last fiscal year, the Star business overall inclusive of sports delivered just north of $200 million of EBITDA, and we think that puts us in a really good pace for our '18 and '20 targets. So we're really pleased with that performance and I think as we see the investments really start to pay off there and the velocity of the business continue, it's on track. With respect to the film studio, I think one of the things that Lachlan said in his remarks about consistency is really important. It's about consistency of creative output. It's about really focusing on having the best partners we can have, and in the process in terms of the decisions on production starts, on new products, et cetera, really functioning more consistently and better.","And I think as I mentioned earlier we've embarked on leadership transition there. There are changes in the future that we want to make, but fundamentally as you said it's a hedge-driven business. We need to be more consistently great in a marketplace that's competitive as it is. When it's hard to get a family off the couch and out to the theater. So we had some great success in the year. I look back at The Martian or Deadpool or things like that, things that are distinctive that are where we can take risks, where we're doing things that maybe other studios aren't doing, and provide something really different in the market place. I think the slate coming up is very promising, but it's going to be tough to judge the film studio in one quarter, it's really a period of time. ","John Nallen","I think that's right, James, and I think that have to remember that the studio was part of the voluntary buyout program last year, so there are significant amount of cost savings that will underpin its results. But ultimately it's about having a higher standard for story-telling and men making better movies.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you, both. ","John Nallen","Thank you, Ben. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you, a couple of questions. On Hulu what else do you need to launch? I think, James, you mentioned that more content will come in. Are they coming in as investors or just part of the package and how should we think about demand for a lower price OTC service?","John Nallen","Thanks, Jessica. Look as I mentioned, Hulu, we do expect more partners, more content companies, more programmers and brands to be represented in the new Hulu service. Hulu is in discussions with a number of those potential providers and suppliers currently. And as those come to completion and we are closer to a launch of the service I know Hulu will be communicating about that. There are no discussion currently about addition equity investment. We think we've got a great set of partners in this business and we're very excited about it. So I think over the next number of months as we see complete some of the supply agreements, you'll see more detail around the content offering and the full breath of it, which we think is exciting. I think it's important to note that we do think that in this rebundling that's going on there's significant demand for great television, there's significant demand for a great customer experience, and we want to be able to deliver it at the lowest price that we can. Fundamentally, that limits Hulu's ability, right? To just go and pay everything for a lot of program, we have to focus on what's the programming that really, really matters and what's going to drive consumption and what are people going to love. So I think it will be, as I described it before, kind of a core package, a core bundle there. And we want to have a great entry point for customers to come in. It's not to say that premium offerings won't be there. Hulu's been a very successful seller of Showtime as a premium add-on to its product today, and we would expect agreements like that to continue to be announced as well.","Jessica Reif Cohen","And then, a couple of other questions. Given the importance of Fox News to the company, can you give us any color on any central strategic shifts or will it be business as it is? And then one follow up on Star. On Hotstar, is there anything you can say about what Indian consumers are actually watching the most and what do you think about the monetization potential of that service?","James Murdoch","So Jessica, I'll start with Fox News. It seems this year will be one of the best years if not the best year for Fox News ever. There is no desire or need to shift the position that it has in the market. It's a very successful business and we are just undergoing a transition to the new leadership. That should not flag at all a transition of the underlying positioning or the strategy of the channel.","John Nallen","And Jessica, with respect to Hotstar, it's interesting, in the beginning we saw pretty severe sort of volatility and spike, largely around sports viewership on the Hotstar platform to when there was a big cricket tournament or something like that. But gradually over the last year what's really built and gotten much more momentum is scripted programming, it's Indian scripted programming in multiple languages, and that's really driving, that's been the most gratifying and to see more consistent viewership of that and that's really a big, big part of the volume now, and it's the fastest way growing part of the volume on a consistent basis, local Indian scripted programming at a very high volumes. So there's a lot of shows, full series stocks, all of that sort of stuff of that many, many thousands of hours that we produce there every year.","James Murdoch","Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Stephen [ph] with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, maybe first on the -- side. I think you may be communicated in the past willingness to keep more in the house for the foreseeable future. We've seen a couple of deals, American Crime Stories, also Homeland, I was wondering if you could just update us on your strategy. And then also on the RSN, there's been some articles lately about the strength of the ratings at RSN. You called that some of the streaming cost you've now got. I was wondering if you could let us know maybe what percentage of your RSN you now have exclusive streaming rights and if there will be a pricing revenue upside tail that we'll see on that in the future. ","James Murdoch","Thanks, Stephen. Look as I mentioned in the remarks before, we do want to be flexible in terms of our licensing and we want to do something that makes sense. The recent American Crime Story agreement with Netflix, we thought it just made a lot of sense. It's an anthology series, so sequential stacking of multiple seasons is less crucial because it's not serialized across seasons, but we were able to secure the current season in full stack and avoid or not give up the kind of hold backs that have been characterized in some of these agreements in the past. So we think it makes a lot of sense for customers watching American Crime Story on FX or on FX Now, and that so you have the in season stacked for the current season. And it was just a very, very attractive agreement for subsequent seasons for us and for our partners in the show. So you think you don't want to be too orthodox about it, but I think the important thing here was it preserves the customer experience that we're seeking to deliver, and for an anthology series like this. We thought it was just a great deal for the company and for shareholders. But I certainly doesn't see any shift in strategy on how we deal with.","Lachlan Murdoch","And then the streaming rights on the RSNs for the MLB and the NBA are in place authenticated in market streaming rights. And we think that's a great part of their value proposition. Look, these are channels and brands that absolutely are enormously successful from a viewing perspective in their markets. If I look at all the MLB teams in the first half of the season so far, I think 10 MLB teams were rated number one in primetime in their markets on nights that they play and half of those teams are our Fox RSNs. So we combine that with streaming opportunities. When we combine that we will be able to do any sort of TV everywhere type environment. We can ask one of their core value propositions to our MVPD partners, both existing MVPDs and future MVPDs.","James Murdoch","Thank you, Stephen. Operator, next question please.","Operator","It will come from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield","Hi, wanted to ask a question on, I know you're still negotiating with other partners for the Hulu virtual MVPD, but just wondering how do you think about the importance of having all four broadcast networks? Can a Hulu launch be successful if you don't have CBS? And I guess along that same theme, if you don't have all of your affiliates on board for the launch and you only have the O&Os, will it basically be like what Sony View and Sling where its next day access versus the live linear and will you move forward or will you wait until you have all the affiliates in all four broadcast networks on board? And then just a quick housekeeping. I think someone said earlier that Hulu now has over 11 million subs. At the Hulu upfront back in May, Mike Hopkins had said that by the end of the month that you have over 12 million subscribers. So just tracking, did the number decline from May until now? I just wanted to follow up on that. Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Rich. So first of all just to note. Hulu is in negotiations with a variety of suppliers as I mentioned, around the new MVPD and wouldn't be right to comment on. Any of those negotiations that Hulu is having with those suppliers, not that we're having. But I would say it's a balance between putting together, you want to put together something that is a core proposition, something that's really going to drive consumption and demand and what the prices are. And without commenting on a particular potential supplier, I would say that you mentioned specifically CBS, customers have access to an Ala Carte CBS all access products, so I don't think that's necessarily, I think that does have an impact on how you would think about price and what you'd be willing to do to have it there. But I don't think any one particular network, given where we are today with Disney and Time Warner and the Fox products there, I don't think any one particular network has hold up value at this point. I think it's a great proposition today. We'd like to make it better.","Lachlan Murdoch","And Rich, just to answer your question on the 11 million subscribers versus the 12 million subscribers. My understanding is that the difference is the 11 million is paying subscribers and the 12 million includes, it's slightly over 11, but the 12 million includes promotional viewers. ","Richard Greenfield","So essentially we could just say between May and now, Hulu's been roughly flat from a subscriber's standpoint?","Lachlan Murdoch","It's been up a touch actually. But it's less than a million, so we're rounding.","James Murdoch","Thank you, Rich. Operator, queue the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. I was hoping that you would talk a little bit more about the growth outlook for the Fox Networks Group, especially with realignment. I mean if you look at paid TV in Latin America, it's not growing like it used to and Europe is struggling on the advertising side of it right now. It seems that we've been focused a lot on Star growth on the last couple of years. Anything on Fox Network Group growth outlook would be helpful. Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Doug. Look, I think one of the things that Fox Network Group International cable assets have been particularly impacted by currency as well as it got knocked around a little bit by some of the advertising challenges particularly if I look from Italy to Turkey, to Brazil, all of these places are pretty challenged and have been over the last year. So I think it's a little bit of a mix tag. We have a lot of confidence in the overall growth of the paid TV universe in a lot of these markets. As I mentioned I think a few quarters ago, probably Southeast Asia, a little bit slower than it was before, but Latin America very strong. And we feel pretty good about that, but I think it's been disproportionately impacted by currencies and sort of patchy, or rather a mix add environment generally in those places.","Doug Mitchelson","And then I guess a follow up. With the change in Sterling, there's been a lot of questions swirling around, strategic interest in Sky. I think in the past you talked about 39% stake is a bit sub-optimal, you serve better off on in all are none. Any change in your outlook for how you think about Sky going forward?","James Murdoch","No, look I'll just, I understand the question and I'll just, I guess it's just like a quarterly update on the lack of a change of view, and look this is not something, we just don't want to get into commenting on what is largely idle speculation and hypothetical. ","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you.","James Murdoch","Next question please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. It will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I have one for James or Lachlan and then one for John. James or Lachlan, it sounds like you guys want to keep your powder dry for M&A, but kind of high bar for [ph] deals. We look at your strategic footprint, where do you think the gaps are in terms of your assets and what types of assets would you be evaluating, that's one. And then for, John, there's a lot of moving pieces on expenses and cable nets, and basically internationally. Could you use a range of what you think growth with the expenses between the U.S. and internationally for '17?","James Murdoch","Let me start by just saying I think it's important to know what James said in his prepared comments which is it is we'd ask you to look at what we've chosen not to do. We'd be incredibly disciplined I think for a few years now in terms of our M&A and what we're willing to pay for businesses that may or may not have some strategic value. I think you know particularly when we look at what some of those businesses have traded for. We're quite happy with where we are today. So moving forward, we're going to be very careful with our capital. We'll be in a position over the next few months and year. We're going to rebuild our balance sheet to be in a healthy position but we'll be opportunistic with how we use.","Lachlan Murdoch","With just areas that we think about and reiterate some of the stuff that we've said in the past, Michael, but you know we do believe in investing upstream. We really believe in content assets. We think that there's an incredible amount of demand for great story telling around the world. And where we've been able to, where we have been able to find inorganic opportunities in that regard that are attractive front returns for shareholders and for the company, we've done that and that's around from [indiscernible] in India all the way to Manhattan with the Yes Network. So I think there are places where they are naturals for us, but it's all a question of value and about returns and making sense. The other place that I think we talked about in the past as well is what are the company's capabilities? In their capabilities, are they monetizing these brands, or really building brands? But we have no kind of sort of checklist or god-forbid a shopping list. We really do think, as Lachlan said, we feel great about the assets we have. We're really focused on operating them with our whole team as well as we can and really driving this business forward with a great footprint around the world and some of the greatest creative assets on the planet, we believe.","James Murdoch","And Michael, outside of the items I called out for '17, the technical point about having the extra months of NatGeo and the initiatives that James referred to. The expense growth at the rest of the cable will be actually below we experienced in the current year. And those are really just normalized increases from sports contracts, from programming investments particularly around political and Fox News. And separately, we continue the initiative of growing Star, so its digital investment around Hotstar and some of its channel will increase. So that's the background on cable.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","Hi, thanks. It's the risk of being very pedestrian. Just a couple of, I guess, housekeeping type of questions. So the first, on domestic affiliate fees plus 6% I think was the number. I think that's a little deceleration sequentially from the first quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong. And just want to know if there's anything we can learn from that? Does that, I know you have a particular group of networks, but is there anything about the paid TV universe or some declines or just specific pricing rollover from you guys that we can, we think about the significance of that number. The second question is similar. James, with your comment on the international advertising. Just I guess really want to ask from this quarter, I think if we take the math from the press release, it looks like maybe a plus 1% constant currency. Obviously that seems like a normally lower numbers than usual. I just want to make sure we can understand anything specific that drove that in as we think about the forecast for that, how are you feeling this quarter. Thanks.","John Nallen","So Todd, I will cover the first one on affiliate fees. It was, you're right it was decelerated, 6% versus 7%, truth be told. With about $10 million more in affiliate revenue we would have been at 7%, so the difference between 6% and 7% was quite small. And often times in these quarters it's mixed. It's how the Telco's lost versus how the MVPDs gain and that really is a factor hovering around that difference. And then in international ads...","James Murdoch","Yes, so first of all, yes it was a smaller number than it has been, and I'd say there is three factors for that. The first one is just weakness in Europe. So in some of the stronger ad market for us, it was fine. The U.K. was okay. But Italy was not, and Turkey was a problem as well. They have a larger advertising waiting to Turkey, believe it or not, just because of the free to air channel there which is a larger ad business than some of the other international cable channels that's all lumped into that segment. And then at Star, we definitely had sort of change in the marketplace there, a little bit where some of the e-commerce money that was spending very heavily in the comparison quarters in the year before. Notably flip cart and snap deal really reduced their spending quite dramatically. So they had grown to be one of the top sectors in advertising there, and just went away. And the e-commerce money that continues to be spent was at Amazon, and that was very spread out more around sports assets, so we didn't get the full benefit of that. There's some in the cricket, but really the IPO got a lot of Amazon's money as well. So there was just a change there in the marketplace. We don't think it's anything more than that, just comparison with those big spenders ameliorating their spending.","Lachlan Murdoch","Just also just to add on to John's comments on the affiliate fees that as you mentioned before we do expect as we began in the affiliate renewals in the second half of the year for those affiliate fees to accelerate again.","James Murdoch","Thank you, Todd. Queue next question please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. Given your ongoing investment in Hulu, how likely are you can take other virtual MVPDs are expected to launch, I guess just sort of maybe address how you balance the financial, perhaps the strategic benefit of being part of competing sort of the streaming bundles? And then just a quick follow up if you can maybe address the domestic ad market, how the upfront went and underlying health of the ad market in TV and cable.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Alexia. I think, I don't think there's any issue with us being a minority investor in Hulu, one MVPD and license into a very vibrant downstream market. So we've obviously, in the last quarter I think we talked about our agreements with Sling and the inclusion of all of our brands in that product, and we obviously like Sony's View service as well, and we would seek to do more. So I think that, there's hasn't been a problem in terms of licensing in our view. Our goal here is we want to see the most competitive downstream market we can. We do think great value can be created in Hulu and our investment in that we're very confident about. But we don't think that any of those things are mutually exclusive.","And just so you know we sell our programming across Europe to multiple MVPDs from particularly Liberty Global, KPN, others, et cetera, while the Sky business is where a major investor and competes vigorously in a lot of those markets. So I think it's just, a good example is India whereSky [ph], we're a significant investor there but we distribute across all of the MVPDs, satellite, cable [ph]. So I think it's consistent with our practice and it's always benefitted us and benefitted customers fundamentally to have more competition downstream. We saw that when Direct TV and Dish really started to grow again really properly in the U.S. many years ago. We've definitely seen that across Latin America. We saw where the Telco's expanding the market, and we think the digital MVPD, kind of universe is going to expand the market again. So we feel pretty good about that.","John Nallen","As for the upfront; we couldn't be happier with the strength of the upfronts. We would now fundamentally completed them all. It's been the strongest upfront we've had in years. CPM pricing is in the high, a very high single-digit if you blend both the network and the cable businesses, and volume increases are up in the mid-single digits. So we couldn't be happier with them. Also the scatter market remains very strong, sort of mid-single digit which I think those are the strength of the advertising market today.","James Murdoch","Thank you, Alexia.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","James Murdoch","Operator, we have time for one last question please.","Operator","Thank you, sir. That will come from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente","Just a housekeeping for John, thanks. On international, I think constant currency affiliates in growth was 19% in the quarter. Can you help us with what sort of international affiliates growth in next year that we might expect? Can you kind of keep that up? And then one for James, just one thing we're starting to hear more about is lower ad loads on cable. I think NatGeo's lowering its number of ad units. What's your appetite for doing that in a more widespread fashion, and what kind of premium CPMs do you get on the remaining ad spots, just in terms like how much higher can the ad pricing be for reduced ad loads format, and then other than sort of that CPM inflation? Maybe you could just talk about what are their benefits you might see or you might expect to see with reduced ad load strategy? Thanks.","James Murdoch","On the international affiliate fee. You're looking in any one particular quarter, you always have ins and outs, but for the year we averaged 15% constant currency growth in international. And the mid-teens kind of growth is generally what we're looking for next year as well.","John Nallen","And then Anthony, on the ad load side. I think first of all, I think relative to some of our cable competitors, I think we've historically and currently generally had lower ad loads. So we do think that's a part of the product experience. It's part of the way that we manage the business. But to the extent that you continue to lower them, it really depends on pricing. We make that call kind of an ongoing basis. I would say that where we see dramatically lower ad loads is in the streaming environment, and the CPM increases our substantial and it makes abundant sense to do that where we can target things better, where we can really innovate in terms of those things. But I think generally speaking for a lot of customers and for more, I do think more, some of our competitors out there when I look across the overall kind of dial for cable choices, I think ad loads have been pretty high on a lot of channels, and they're probably right to reduce them.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks very much.","James Murdoch","I think that's all the time for questions we have. So thank you very much, everyone, for joining the call and for listening.Thanks, everyone.","Reed Nolte","And if you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or Mike Petrie.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen; our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we\u2019ll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2017 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of, and reconciliation, of such measures can be found in our earnings release and in our 10-Q filing.","Please note that certain financial measures used on this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And lastly, please note that our offer for Sky plc that was announced last December is governed by the U.K. Takeover Code. As such, there are strict limitations as to what we can say with respect to that transaction and we are restricted to providing information that has been publicly announced.","And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks Reed, good afternoon everyone. I apologize for cold that I have.","We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of solid growth. The strength of these results generated the highest core earnings per share in the company's history. This record results reflect continued positive progress across our businesses with revenue and EBITDA growth coming from both our Cable Networks and Television segments. And whilst earnings at the film studio decreased when compared to one of our most profitable film quarters ever in the prior year when we benefited significantly from Deadpool, they were robust nonetheless.","Importantly we have driven our business forward against all our strategic priorities to growing the distribution of our video brands on both traditional and demand emerging platforms, to innovative digital advertising products and partnerships such as OpenAP and most critically to delivering outstanding sports and news broadcasting.","In fact, the scale and health of our sports and news broadcasting businesses continue to be differentiator for us with over half of the company's advertising revenues earned in these zones. Of course we had an incredible Super Bowl but we also saw viewership gains for the Daytona 500 on FBC and for MLS Soccer on Fox Sports 1 which for the first time beat ESPN2 for entire month in February.","Additionally viewership at our regional sports networks continues to be exceptionally strong with major league baseball leading the way. Yankees ratings are up 39% over last season and the Atlanta Braves ratings are up over 54% this season so far. The business is in great shape with all expiring team rights deals satisfactorily renewed.","Not to be outdone, Fox News is the number one basic cable channel in both total day and prime time viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. In fact, Fox News has delivered its highest rated quarter ever rating strength we expect to continue.","In scripted programming our partnerships with the world's best storytellers continue to produce groundbreaking new series that drives a long-term value of our core brands. FX debuted successful first seasons of Taboo, Legion and Feud adding to the networks reputation as a creative powerhouse.","National Geographic has made great progress in its goal to more closely align its programming with its brand. The recent Genius premier from producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Nat Geo's first scripted anthology series, drew over 4 million viewers in the U.S. alone and was distributed further across the global reach of the National Geographic International channels.","The Fox Broadcasting networks mixed performance in ratings this season has been frustrating for all. So we are encouraged by our development for the fall and look forward to presenting a strong schedule at our upfront this Monday.","Of course the network does provide our TV studio a powerful launch platform for it shows and it is important to consider these two businesses together. Twenty-First Century Fox television is coming of a stellar 2016-2017 broadcast season. This past year our TV studio produced a number one show on five different networks including Empire on Fox, American Crime Story on FX, Modern Family on ABC, This Is Us on NBC, and American Dad! on TBS.","The solid performance of our film studio with the box office successes of Logan and Hidden Figures underscore the range and quality of what we bring our audiences. Looking out over the next year, we feel good about our slate when Alien: Covenant directed by Ridley Scott coming later this month, followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in July, Kingsman: The Golden Circle in September and The Greatest Showman at Christmas. We've also recently announced the June 2018 release of Deadpool 2 something my young boys are wildly looking forward to but which they won't be allowed to watch.","Turning to our international businesses, the financial impact of the Indian demonetization we believe is behind us but the financial impact has obscured impressive operational progress, most notably Star India is increasing its viewership lead over our competitors and the continued rise and rise of Hotstar as the emerging platform of choice in India. James will have some more to say about that in a few minutes.","The company continues to attract great new leaders such as Amy Listerman, who has joined us as Fox News CFO and Marianne Gambelli was has joined us as President of Fox News' Advertising Sales and we welcome them to the company.","We feel good about where we and confident that the strategic plan we continue to execute against is differentiating us from our competitors and building long-term value across our businesses.","With that, I'll hand it over to John.","John Nallen","Thanks Lachlan, and good afternoon everyone.","Today we reported another strong quarter of financial results posting double-digit gains in adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA despite the very difficult year-over-year comparisons at our film segment which Lachlan referred to.","Third quarter revenues increased $336 million or 5% to $7.56 billion led by higher advertising revenues at the Television segment from the broadcast of this year Super Bowl and affiliate revenue growth at the Cable Networks segment. This was partially offset by slightly lower content revenues at the Film segment.","Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.94 billion, a 3% increase from the prior year reflecting double-digit increases at our Television segment and mid-single digit growth at the Cable Networks offset in part by lower Film segment results from the challenging comp to a year ago.","From a bottom-line perspective we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $811 million or $0.44 per share. This quarter included charges of $142 million reported in other net which primarily represents the fair value adjustments on currency hedges related to the pending sky transaction.","Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net, impairment and restructuring and equity earnings adjustments, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54 which is a 15% increase over the comparable $0.47 reported a year ago.","So, now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the third quarter. The Cable Network segment reported EBITDA of $1.45 billion up 5% on revenue growth of 2% with total segment expenses pretty much unchanged from last year. Domestic cable revenues increased 6% led by affiliate fee growth of 8% which reflects higher average rates across all of our brands.","Domestic ad revenues were equal to the prior year as increases from the rating strength at Fox News, and at FS1 were offset by reductions from the non-channel businesses at Nat Geo Partners. EBITDA at our domestic channel was equal to the prior year as higher revenues were offset by increased investments in programming most notably the planned investments to support our expansion of original series at FX and the new programming initiative at Nat Geo, as well as contractual sports rights step ups.","Third quarter reported international cable revenues declined 7%, as low advertising and syndication revenues were partially offset by mid-single-digit affiliate fee growth. Reported advertising revenues were as expected down 18% versus the prior year principally due to the absence of Stars prior year broadcast of the ICC T20 World Cup and Asia Cup cricket tournaments, and the continued negative impact from India's demonetization initiative.","Now while the major effects of demonetization are now behind us, it negatively impacted the third quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. Reported internationally EBITDA contribution increased 44% primarily due to the lower sports programming costs at Star and affiliate fee growth.","At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $190 million increased 52% from last year on revenue increases of 30%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year Super Bowl where we generated approximately $500 million in gross revenues on Super Bowl Sunday and from continued retransmission consent revenue growth. These increases more than offset the impact of lower primetime entertainment ratings from the absence of American Idol.","At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $373 million was $97 million below year ago. This quarter is very solid earnings were led by the theatrical releases of Logan and Hidden Figures and higher television production contributions from the licensing of American Crime Story and Homeland.","The comparisons to last year's third quarter as Lachlan mentioned are challenging since last year included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Deadpool and the home entertainment release of the Martian. These difficult comparisons will continue in the fourth quarter from the ongoing strength of these films last year, as well as from the quarterly timing of spot sales and reduced syndication sales versus last year's fourth quarter. And finally from a balance sheet perspective we continue to accumulate cash reflecting our priority to point our capital toward the planned acquisition of Sky.","And with that, let me turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, John and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","So as you've heard the first nine months of the fiscal year have been strong and we made good progress on a number of fronts, but I just like to spend a minute or two addressing some of the key things we've been seeing in the marketplace and share some thoughts on our priorities going forward.","So a few points to make on the following subjects. The advertising trends and performance, the distribution universe for our video brands, and the velocity of the business in terms of revenue that might not be so obvious at first glance. So first of all we're very pleased with the advertising performance in the quarter which grew 16% companywide year-over-year. Now obviously as mentioned at Super Bowl was a major contributor which was offset in part by the lack of both the Asia Cup and ICC T20 Championship at Star, which we had in the comparable quarter last year and softer demand due to the effect of the demonetization as John mentioned, and the absence of American Idol at FBC which had its final run on Fox last year.","But it's important to note that all but one of our U.S. cable brand saw good advertising growth with only the National Geographic Channel down which we expected due to our shift in programming strategy that Lachlan talked about earlier.","National scatter remains strong, although local appears a little softer than we like particularly autos. For the month into the fourth quarter, we're looking for at least high single-digit growth for both our domestic and international cable portfolios.","As for the distribution landscape a few highlights, domestically as John mentioned we saw affiliate income growth year-over-year about 8% and acceleration from the same period last year and from the last quarter as planned. We expect that growth to continue to accelerate in Q4 and into next year.","The U.S. paid subscriber base for us was up slightly about 0.5% but obviously we some declines in the most widely distributed tiers of about 1.5% year-over-year which we have not seen accelerating since last quarter. In fact, everywhere we look we see a landscape of opportunity as downstream distribution becomes more innovative and competitive.","Despite renewed market commentary over the last week's, we remain of the view that innovation and competition from new entrants and incumbent operators will ameliorate and then reverse the trends as digital rebundling drives overall universe growth.","At Star we continue to grow at a good pace but the timing of some affiliate renewals last year affect this quarter's comparisons. You may recall that we had extraordinary growth last year in Q3 of some 20% in international cable affiliate revenue, so we are comping very nicely against a very high bar. This year we grew affiliate revenue in every key region with some of the pace at Fox Network Groups international channels slowing due to some local events such as the closure of two distributors in Thailand and some other weakness in Southeast Asia.","And the Hotstar platform in India continues to make strides expanding its watch time over the prior year quarter by 220% making it by some estimates about 14 times the watch time for Netflix. ","In Europe, Asia and Latin America we've introduced innovative nonlinear packages to each of their regions under the labels Fox Plus and Fox Premium all tailored for specific market and offering consumers more choice, a better experience and ultimately for us making a better business. And in the U.S. the digital MVPD revolution has only now reached the starting line.","So taken all together, if we exclude the film segment which obviously didn't have a Deadpool in the quarter, revenue globally grew at about 11%. We think that's a pretty good clip and it's a testament to the diversity and breadth of the business geographically and by mix. And year-to-date our EBITDA is up 11% which underscores how all this comes together with a durable velocity underlying the business.","I want to reiterate that our strategy to focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available not less is paying dividends.","Our business has been an expression of the technological advances shaping our industry from way back from silent movies to talkies, from feature film exhibition to broadcast television and from broadcast to multichannel cable and satellite TV. And the underlying technological advances today ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video creators and platforms.","We think this is only just the beginning and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing.","In short, if content is indeed King and using it to build platforms that are expression of these current underlying trends presents the most promising opportunity for our company in decades.","Now before closing I like to quickly touch upon Sky. The business continues to deliver on its growth strategy recently reporting good financial performance with subscriber growth across the group. Last month we welcomed the decision by the European commission clearing unconditionally our proposed transaction. And we continue to work with U.K. regulators and we\u2019re confident that the proposed transaction will be completed by the end of this calendar year as we said before.","Thanks very much and we\u2019re happy to take any questions you may have. Reed?","Reed Nolte","Thank you, James. Operator, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks I have one for James. Given that you were the last major media company to report and we appreciate the update in your subscriber trends. No one yet ever has framed how big the virtual MVPD universe is currently. So could you tell us in aggregate how big virtual subs have been for you in the past quarter and what was the number a quarter ago so just give a sense of within your trends how much is the virtual MVPD business helping stabilize your cautious global trends?","James Murdoch","So first of all I don\u2019t want to get into disclosing sort of individual partners of ours kind of paid customer numbers, but I would say that it is very, very early days. And really I think mostly for us the think that I point out is number one, the inclusion of our core brands and the investment in those core brands that we've been making over the last couple of years has really worked in terms of inclusion in new virtual MVPDs in every major one all pretty much, all of our brands are there. And we see that growing pretty fast over the next number of quarters and years.","But today which is a pretty small number because you really have really just DirecTV Now and Sling in the quarter and a little bit of Sony. But it's really now I think the increased competition YouTube launching after this quarter I think it was just in April and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week.","So it's really just early days there. So what\u2019s really driving this more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands and some of our brands are less mature. And we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD subscriber base as well. And I think actually one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter.","John Nallen","Michael I\u2019d add to what James said and James also touched upon on his prepared remarks. The pleasing thing from our point of view is how different all the emerging MVPDs are and they\u2019re targeting different segments of our so the consumer audience. So between DirecTV Now and Sling TV, YouTube obviously Hulu, and PlayStation Vue they all very different services and we think this is incredibly important because not only are they designed - many of them are designed to replace traditional MVPDs subscriber numbers and losses but they\u2019re targeting entirely new segments of U.S. households, segments that have broadband now but potentially don\u2019t have traditional MVPDs.","So that's why it gives us a lot of confidence as James mentioned in his remarks that not only will these new services ameliorate decline in traditionally MVPDs but will actually grow the universe quite significantly over time.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Michael. Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Thank you. One for John I think on the Cable Networks it was obviously a lot of movement on the cost front so as you look out I don\u2019t even the June quarter or beyond are there more sports rights costs or incremental investments we should be thinking about or are you entering more of a normalized out of the mid single type of growth going forward?","John Nallen","We'll see I'm only looking forward to the fourth quarter John but as I do we\u2019ll see kind of mid single on the domestic side which is the continued investment in Nat Geo and FX of the programming, but we don't have a big sports step up having domestically. But uniquely international we have a big cricket event in Star the Champion's Trophy. So we'll see a higher growth in that quarter uniquely for that event otherwise our expenses should be in that mid-single zone.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, John. Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","I was hoping some more detail on India James, I mean competitor highlighted yesterday that the Indian marketplace is challenging they were pleased at low exposure that obviously conflicts with your commentary and prepared remarks. Can you talk about the trajectory towards the long-term target of $1 billion of profitability and at what point Hotstar's cannibalistic and any other thoughts in the marketplace relative to that other point of view would be helpful probably?","James Murdoch","Look we\u2019re very enthusiastic about our business in India. I think what we\u2019re seeing there today as Lachlan mentioned an increase level of leadership in terms of our entertainment share. Our sports businesses is really going from strength to strength since we've acquired half of the ESPN STAR Sports joint venture number of years ago and really reinvented STAR Sports in the marketplace. It's been very, very successful not just in Cricket but also with Kabaddi and with the Indian Super League, the Soccer League there really rounding up the schedule.","So we feel very good about it. I mean when look at the marketplace we obviously had a disruption with the demonetization and as John mentioned that's largely we largely through that now. It wasn't that big an impact in the last quarter and we\u2019re at the run rate that we need to be at to get to our targets at this point.","So we feel on target, we feel like the business is in pretty robust health creatively it\u2019s performing very, very well and we feel confident about the overall the Indian environment generally. I did note some of those comments I heard about that and I was surprised because at least from our business perspective we take the view that you go into a market like India in the expectation that in success it's really going to change your life.","So you\u2019re really don't go anything other than the whole hog and that has really paid off well. We have a very profitable an exciting business there and I think speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the media sector today. When I look at all that it\u2019s very performance so I think I urged you to think about all of these firms have different strength and weaknesses. And our business has been on very clear path about investing in these big brands around the world, being global first, getting exposure to market that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us. And investing on screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible context experience they can have and maybe that\u2019s different from other players.","Reed Nolte","Thanks Doug. Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","We have a question from Jessica Reif with Bank of America. Please go ahead. In case we've lost Mr. Reif line one moment. We will go Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente","I have two, one for James and one for John. James just wanted to ask about the appointment of Joe Marchese as the Head of Ad Sales I mean talk about the new model and kind of given his background in advanced advertising what is that appointment, and what\u2019s your thought process in appointing Joe say about your expectations or where the TV broadcast advertising model is going in terms of ad product.","And then for John, you guys have really outperformed the market in terms of domestic affiliate revenue growth of course that's due to some recent large distributor renewals or at least one. So can you just talk a little bit more about the outlook for that? I mean I think James said in his prepared remarks, strong growth heading into '18. I think some folks are wondering about the second half of '18 after you kind of laughed at big renewal.","And step up from that. So will other renewals help? Could you just remind us what portion of your footprint is up by that time that can perhaps pick you guys up despite the anniversary? Hope that make sense. Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Anthony. Well, I think on the advertising side, obviously when you have leadership changes and transitions you really look to what you think the needs of the business are going to be over time, and in the future.","And I think in Joe and also in Danielle, Majid, also reporting to Randy in that area. We\u2019ve got leaders that are really very, very capable. And I think that the advanced advertising piece, combining now with the sort of core advertising sort of broader TV advertising piece, I think is just makes a lot of logical sense.","We look at this business as an audience business and attention business. And having an organizational structure and the leaders of it aligned with that is the right strategy going forward and we're really excited about the next chapter for our domestic ad business. Lachlan, you want to add anything to that?","Lachlan Murdoch","Joe Marchese is an extraordinary executive. We're very lucky to have him driving our new advertising, advance advertising initiatives over the past couple of years. He\u2019s going to do a tremendous job across all of our advertising sales portfolio.","John Nallen","Anthony, it\u2019s John to deal with the second part, I got out of the guidance business a couple of years ago, but clearly, our domestic affiliate fee growth is strong and we look at the peers, and we are putting some real points on the board here.","So we've accelerated this quarter. We\u2019re going to accelerate again next quarter and into '18. So if we get volume from the new virtual MVPD, then that's icing on the cake. So we're feeling very confident about our growth.","Operator","We have question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. John, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just humoring - I just want to confirm. You were saying that '18 would accelerate from the fourth quarter level in '17.","John Nallen","Not necessarily saying that, Ben, but I was saying that from where we are in the third quarter, there's acceleration still ahead of us.","Lachlan Murdoch","By the way, I think it's something John has pointed to in the at least two or three earnings call. So I think the credibility of how closely we watch the affiliate revenue and growth, I think we\u2019ve got a track record of delivering what we are.","Ben Swinburne ","And my bigger question is, Fox News has been a tremendous business for you guys. Obviously there\u2019s been a lot of change there and a lot of commentary in the press about advertisers showing some frustration and then you\u2019re coming back to the business. But I\u2019m wondering, affiliate fees are a huge part of that business model. I think its most of the revenue. Have you had any impact or conversations with distributors about some of the volatility there and the changes in talent and how you\u2019re feeling?","I mean, the numbers sort of speak for themselves, but how are you feeling about that networks programming and position with distributors who are out there every day with consumers for that network?","Lachlan Murdoch","I think it\u2019s interesting if you go on YouTube TV, for example, and you see the number one trending live challenge shows on emerging the MVPD, it's almost always the case, Fox News. And that continues obviously post lot of the programming changes in line that we\u2019ve had.","As we've said, the channel continues its ratings dominance. Move forward very strongly, very strong with both affiliates and with advertising sales. We\u2019re very confident in the future of that business.","Ben Swinburne ","Thank you, guys.","Reed Nolte","Operator, we think we have time for one last question.","Operator","That comes from the line of Marci Ryvicke with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicke","Just curious about how you think of the TV station business with the Blackstone JV, you are bidding for Tribune, and you may not have bid Tribune, maybe you\u2019re going back to bid Tribune. We're just curious how your distribution strategy may have changed.","James Murdoch","So first of all, look what I don't think is - I think this is not a forum to get into hypothetical conversations around M&A that may or may not have happened. I would say that in the end we didn't bid for Tribune, we talked about this with investment community and our shareholders in the past, the station business is a strong business for us, it's an important part of our network distribution, it's a strong business in terms of local programming, local news and so on.","But it isn't a place that we're targeting to deploy capital into and so anything that we look at there is more about, can we change our strategic position, could we think about scale in a different way but not in a way that would be - not in way that would be a use of capital for us at all just to be clear.","But it remains - look it\u2019s a strong business and I think the local - relevant to those local bands and the local stations in their communities continues to be very high.","Marci Ryvicke","Do you feel that the leverage maybe shifting to stations does that get bigger, do you worry about that?","James Murdoch","Look I think our affiliate agreements are constantly something that we think about and adjust. They come up in different cycles and we feel that we have quite a lot of options with respect to the working with our partners. Tribune is obviously a big partner of ours and we look forward to continuing to work with them.","We provide an enormous value for our affiliate partners as they do for us. So we think it's a pretty balance relationship and one that we strive to make fair.","Lachlan Murdoch","I think that\u2019s exactly right. When you're speaking of retransmission consent in particular, obviously the value of the network programming in particular sport is incredibly important part of that relationship with the affiliates and what they can achieve through their retransmission consent.","James Murdoch","I think that's all we\u2019re going to have time for folks. So much appreciate everyone joining the call and thanks very much for your time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 6:30 PM Eastern Time today until May 24 at midnight.

Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, Greg. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to 21st Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2015, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and the reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such a segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included our earnings release.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you very much, Reed, and good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those of you who might be in different time zones. I'm pleased to join you today from Los Angeles to report our first fiscal quarter earnings. I'm going to make a few comments, then turn the call over John and James who are both in London.","We've made good progress this quarter. Our performance underscores the strength of our business and the durability of the growth strategies we have pursued over the last number of years and continue to do so. But even with progress, we are all united in the view that this is a time of transformative change in our industry. It's the kind of change that demands equal measures of clear thinking and of calculated risk-taking. In this quarter, we've applied both to good effect.","Now there are some essential points that must be considered. While demand for the type of high quality storytelling, news and live sport that we produce continues to grow, our viewers are increasingly choosing when and how they experience our programming. Live viewing of television is contracting as a percentage of total viewing, especially in the younger demographics coveted by advertisers.","The definition of rating success has evolved from overnight ratings to three-day and seven-day ratings to more accurately reflect how programming is being consumed, and it will need to evolve further. Take for example the season two premier of our breakout hit, Empire. It reached nearly 12 million total viewers in live plus same day; a great number. But that figure more than doubles to 25 million when we look at 30-day multi-platform viewing.","We see similar lifts across our networks when we look at actual consumption across the spectrum of viewing when compared to the current live plus three-day industry standard. Using Nielsen live plus seven-day ratings, the Fox network is up a couple of percent year-over-year, and excluding sports, we are up almost 10%. But that tells only half of the picture.","Our Fox Networks average nonlinear audience has risen by about a third year over year. It's a testament to the fact that premium broadcast content is in more demand than ever, but it also illustrates the needs for the industry to move to modern ratings currencies. It reflects today's consumption of media in a way that is highly measurable and relevant to advertisers.","Driving part of this change is without doubt the emergence of over-the-top services such as Hulu and Netflix. Another byproduct of these services is clearly the maturing of the traditional large cable bundle. While we see this trend as having less impact on Fox as a group and perhaps on others. That's because our key U.S. brands, Fox, Fox News, Fox Sports, National Geographic and the FX Suite are in great demand, due in large part to the years of significant programming and marketing investments. In fact, this quarter's results saw increases in our aggregate number of U.S. domestic subscribers compared to the year ago of over 1%, with subscriber additions at our younger, less distributed channels more than offsetting the overall 1% to 2% declines impacting the overall industry. And internationally, we also continued to see subscription growth and are benefiting from demographic trends and pay television gains in high-growth markets.","Overall, we feel exceptionally well positioned, with robust demand for our quality programming, leadership across entertainment, sports and news, and enhanced digital products focus and strong brands that we have made a focus of our investment. We look forward to continuing to make strides against our strategic plan to continue to return real value to our shareholders over the remainder of this fiscal period and beyond.","And with that, I'll now hand it over to John and James in London for their comments and for questions.","John Nallen","Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good morning, everyone. Starting off, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky last November, our reported financial results for the first quarter are not like for like. So as we've done in the past, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior year period. Most of my comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis.","So first quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $406 million to $6.1 billion as continued revenue growth in the Cable Networks segment was more than offset by lower revenue at the Filmed segment. Note that the absence of shine and overall adverse foreign currency movements each negatively impacted quarterly revenues by approximately $200 million. Together, these approximate the total year-over-year quarterly revenue decline.","Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.54 billion, a $37 million decrease from a year ago. This decline reflects double-digit growth at the Cable Networks and Television segments, which were more than offset by lower contributions at the Filmed segment. This year's results include slightly more than a $100 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movement. Absent this impact, our overall growth rate would be 5%.","From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $678 million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and of equity owners' adjustments primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and disposition, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 this year, down one penny from the comparable $0.39 a year ago. And overall, with this first quarter now completed, we're holding to the financial guidance expectations we provided to you at our last call.","So now let me provide some additional comments on the performance at our operating segments for the first quarter. And let's start with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.31 billion was up 26% on segment revenue growth of 7%. Domestic revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by affiliate fee growth of 11% and advertising increases of 4%. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 19% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues in conjunction with total cost increases of only 4%, led by lower costs at the FX channels.","First quarter reported international affiliate fee and ad revenues were both essentially even with last year. However, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, local currency affiliate fees and advertising revenues were each up around 10%.","Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased over 50% even after reflecting an approximate $60 million negative impact from foreign exchange. This reported growth was largely due to lower sports programming costs at Star Sports from the absence of last year's India-England cricket series. Elsewhere, double-digit local currency EBITDA growth at the Star entertainment channels and at the Fox International Channels were essentially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency, principally from Latin America and from the euro.","Turning to our Television segment, first quarter EBITDA was $196 million, 13% higher than prior year results. This improvement largely reflects continued strong retransmission consent revenue growth and lower programming expenses at the Fox broadcast network and stations, which were partially offset by a 5% decline in segment advertising revenues. This advertising decline reflects the expected impact of one less week of the NFL due to a later regular season start which we get back in the third quarter and lower political ad revenues at the stations due to the midterm elections in the prior year.","At the Film segment, we reported first quarter EBITDA of $149 million, $309 million below last year. This decline was primarily driven by challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the home entertainment release of RIO 2 compared to reduced theatrical contributions this year that included the underperformance of Fantastic Four. This quarter was also impacted by the inclusion of significant pre-releasing costs in advance of the successful October theatrical release of The Martian.","Our TV production contributions were also lower in the quarter, primarily due to lower cable syndication revenues owing to last year's sale of How I Met Your Mother. Overall, revenues for the Film segment decreased by 28%, with close to half of this decline reflecting both the absence of revenues from Shine, which we merged with Endemol last December, and foreign currency movement.","Shifting over to our buyback activity since July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of Fox A shares, and we're on plan to complete the authorized $5 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe that we've previously announced. Subsequent to quarter end, we issued $1 billion in long-term debt and we repaid $200 million of maturities with approximately $500 million in further maturities over the next year.","With regards to financial guidance, as I said earlier, with one quarter under our belts, we're holding to the expectations we gave you three months ago. Specifically, we continue to anticipate a total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single digit range, above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015, and that number excludes the impact of the DBS segment contributions.","Now foreign currencies have clearly weakened since our August call, and this volatility continues to be a risk to keep an eye on as the year goes forward, but our underlying business operating trends have generally been progressing as expected in the aggregate.","As you know, when 21st Century Fox was formed in 2013, we provided our three-year goals and our guidance, and have updated you on those in each of the years in that cycle. As we look to the end of that three-year period upon the completion of this fiscal year, I'd like to touch on our approach to financial guidance going forward.","Looking back, the three years had ups and downs led by currency impacts, which absorbed hundreds of millions of growth dollars, and had structural changes to our portfolio of businesses. But through that period, we have been and will continue to be transparent and direct about the trends we are seeing and their impact on our outlook. We are very confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities we have ahead to sustain long-term growth, but we don't want to chase a short-term target through changes in our operating plan merely because a currency rate changes, a movie release shifts or underperforms, or we modify our approach to SVOD licensing. It's not good for our management team, and it's not good for our shareholders.","So beginning with fiscal 2017, we will modify our approach to financial guidance to eliminate our emphasis on a specific dollar annual earnings target. Instead, we'll provide you with quantitative and qualitative information on those key areas where we have good visibility and on the trends and initiatives in our businesses. We'll also provide insight into where we'll be focusing our resources to maximize opportunities through both organic innovation and through investment. And of course, we'll also continue to provide details around our annual capital allocation plan and our targets.","Now let me turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, John. Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. As you've heard from Lachlan and John, the investments we've been making in our core brands in all our key markets are progressing and producing returns, and we continue to push the pace of these initiatives as we see meaningful opportunity ahead of us. On the short-term front, as you've heard from John's review, we continue to make progress against the fiscal 2016's financial objectives. We expect strong growth in our core cable franchises, promising forward movement in our TV Broadcast segment, offset by some currency headwinds and short-term performance in the Film business, which as you know we measure over a longer period as results can be lumpy due to timings and individual picture's performance.","We also continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, specifically, to create compelling and unique storytelling to enhance the customer experience of our digital video brands and to leverage our leadership positions in developing markets where we see the greatest opportunities, particularly India and Latin America. So we've seen good momentum in our domestic cable portfolio, where our overall EBITDA growth is up 19% versus a year ago. This growth, led by revenue gains, is a clear result of the investments we've made and the work the team has done and continues to do to bolster the customer offerings of our core brands. It also reflects increases in our aggregate number of domestic subscribers compared to a year ago of over 1%.","Looking forward, as Lachlan noted, we anticipate that some of the conversations we're having with new streaming distribution services not yet to market will result in new revenue that will augment the existing viewing alternatives.","Now I'd like to update you on the progress we're making at a few of our key brands. Our domestic Sports business continued to deliver and has increasingly become a critical component for distributors. In aggregate, our brands currently provide more than 25% of all sports viewing in the U.S., national and local combined. I know there's been some recent attention on the potential disruption from the digital distribution of sports. Last week, Yahoo! and the NFL announced that they had 33.6 million streams or 15.2 million unique views on their NFL Webstream game. But when digital numbers are put on a comparable basis for TV ratings, Yahoo! delivered an average 1.6 million U.S. viewers per minute. That same day, on average, 18 million viewers per minute were watching the NFL on Fox.","FS1 is making real headway as well and is [indiscernible] plan by pretty much all metrics. Over the past quarter, we strengthened our audience engagement, extending last spring's successes from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup and U.S. Open Golf with strong MLB regular and post-season events. Nationally, regular-season baseball viewership on FBC and FS1 increased 16% and 22%, respectively, over last year's level. As a New Yorker and as a broadcaster, I'm disappointed of course with the World Series finishing in five games. But unfortunately, there's no changing that now. But even with fewer gains, this year's World Series averaged close to 15 million viewers, more than last year's full seven-game performance, and ranks as the best five-game average since 2009, when the Yankees beat the Phillies in six games.","Locally, our regional sports networks are commanding presence, as demonstrated by our regular-season baseball telecast on the RSN, with 13 out of our 15 teams ranking at or near the top of local primetime ratings. And this year's World Series champion, the Kansas City Royals, carried on Fox Sports Midwest, scored the highest regular-season local TV ratings of any RSN in 13 years. We look forward to welcoming them in all our RSN NOB teams back for spring training. What's clear from this is that our sports brands are a fundamental differentiator for 21CF and they'll continue to deliver returns for years to come.","At the FX suite of channels, we continue to deliver exciting new originals to audiences everywhere. In particular, the American Horror Story franchise continues to be a ratings and critical phenomenon. It won five Emmy awards in September and, more recently, its fifth installment debuted as the second most watched telecast in FX Networks history in the key 18 to 49 demo, and the premiere has reached more than 15 million total viewers to date across all platforms.","The reception that Fargo is getting in its sophomore outing is also very encouraging, and I encourage all of you to watch the show. It's really one of the best and most exciting pieces of storytelling on air anywhere. We look forward to calendar 2016 as well with some truly great new and returning shows, including Ryan Murphy's American Crime Story, the People versus OJ Simpson, and the Americans on FX and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on FXX. Fox News continues to go from strength to strength. The August GOP debate delivered a record 24 million total viewers, making it the number one highest-rated non-sports cable telecast of all time. This summer, Fox News was the number one channel across all of basic cable for five consecutive weeks.","The Kelly File and Hannity both reached ratings high this past quarter since debuting their current timeslots. And the new Fox business schedule is gaining momentum, and the channel is hosting another Republican debate on November 10. And we think it's really a great opportunity to showcase and differentiate FOXBusiness in terms of depth and quality and production.","Outside of the U.S., channels have continued their growth trajectory. At STAR, the entertainment channels generated double-digit revenue and profit increases on the strength of original programming. STAR Sports Pro per body season two continues its successful run with strong ratings growth. And we expect the business to make meaningful profit progress this year, in line with the goals we've discussed with you in the past. The Fox International Channels, even with some regional economic headwinds, grew with unique paying subscribers by 13% over year ago levels, now approaching $300 million, while also delivering local double-digit local currency revenue and profit growth.","More broadly, we're working hard to build on the strength of our brand portfolio. A few months ago, we announced the agreement to expand our successful joint venture with the National Geographic Society. Our plans to form National Geographic Partners, which combines the National Geographic Society's branded media assets, including one of the most recognized and respected magazines in the world and a substantial digital footprint, with the National Geographic channels, among the most widely distributed television services globally, is an enormous opportunity for the company.","The new limited run series Breakthrough, which brings to life scientific and technological discovery for some of the biggest names in film, including Ron Howard, Brian Grazer and Brett Ratner, exemplify the kind of storytelling that is unique to National Geographic. Combining all these consumer-facing assets into one entity provide greater opportunities to leverage one of the world's most recognized and treasured brands, especially in a nonlinear world. The integration planning and implementation is moving along, and we are on track to close the transaction in the next few weeks.","Turning to our U.S. Broadcast business, trends this fall season are encouraging. While still early, we're seeing positive results, driven by new programming and our investment in our returning shows. We're happy with the performance of Empire in its second outing, the show really is a phenomenon, and it's one borne out of our desire to support storytellers and our appetite for taking creative risks. Beyond Empire, Fox has a number of new series that have provided significant gains year over year for us. Rosewood, Scream Queens, Grandfathered and the Grinder have driven percentage increases anywhere from 21% to 78% compared to the same time slots last year. It's fair to say that Minority Report has been a disappointment, and we have shortened the series order and expect to have new programming in the second half. While last year is not the benchmark we would aspire to measure against, nonetheless, total viewership growth, live, multiplatform, and time-shifted to date, is up 10% year on year.","As with every fall broadcast season, a lot of attention is paid to the overnight ratings reports that measure the linear viewership of the new series premieres, and we're focusing, as Lachlan said, more on total viewership and driving overall consumption on a multiplatform, multi-day basis. The Fox Network is unique in that it attracts the youngest audience of any major broadcast network. Perhaps more than any other network, we're seeing significant audience growth from multiplatform viewing and from extended C3 and C7 viewing. For example, in addition to the Empire 30-day numbers which Lachlan talked about, Scream Queens more than doubles its live audience, over 130% when including viewership across all platforms. We're seeing similar numbers for other shows. And in fact, more than 50% of our ad inventory is now sold in the C7 window.","It's true that much of this viewership is monetized today at a lower level than what we would like, and as I've said before, the important thing is to grow the audience, and our capabilities with respect to selling that audience are improving. We're on track to grow our non-linear ad revenue by around 40% this fiscal. This includes inventory across Hulu, VOD, FX Now, Fox Now, Fox Sports To Go and Fox Sports Digital. We think it's important to create and distribute together, and I am pleased that approximately 70% of our new primetime shows are from our own studio, 20th Century Fox Television, up from around 50% last year. The full lifetime value of these assets is something we're very focused on.","TCF TV and its subsidiaries continue to benefit from the overall strong demand for scripted programming, producing 36 series for 12 networks this season. While a little more than half of these series, 64%, are supported Fox channels, we continue to be a major provider of shows to others, with hit series such as Homeland, Modern Family and Fresh Off the Boat. Quality storytelling has never been more in demand.","Moving to the Film Studio, first quarter film earnings were well below a year ago, reflecting release timing and the lack of a major successful release. However, the recent success of The Martian and a very solid slate of upcoming pictures gives us some comfort here. Looking ahead, we're bringing Charlie Brown to the big screen this weekend with The Peanuts Movie, and we then have the next installment of the very successful Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise in December, and the holiday release of Joy, which reunites Jennifer Lawrence with David O. Russell once again. Also in December, The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio in a wonderful film by Alejandro Inarritu, the very promising Deadpool this February, and we then wrap up the fiscal year with two big global franchises with X-Men: Apocalypse and the long-awaited sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence.","And looking a little further ahead, we'll also be releasing franchise extensions for Ice Age in the summer of 2016, Planet of the Apes, Aliens, Maze Runner, Kingsman, and of course, Avatar over the next few years.","It's worth noting that the film industry is gaining strength. The calendar year-to-date consumer spending on digital home entertainment, up mid-teens for the industry, and a bit higher for us.","We're making progress as well in our non-consolidated businesses. The combination of the three Sky businesses is producing strong results, and together, these businesses are thriving, adding around one million paid core subscription products this quarter and achieving the best overall U.K. sub growth we've seen in four years, in addition to strong customer growth in Germany and steady performance in Italy. Sky is truly setting the pace in digital television across Europe.","Hulu continues to grow both subscribers and engagement aggressively. Year-to-date through September, total viewing at Hulu is up 85% versus prior-year, and net subscriber additions are up more than 60%.","And at Endemol Shine Group, our joint venture with Apollo continues to deliver high-quality programming globally, with non-scripted content such as Hunted being picked up by CBS in the U.S. and new scripted programming such as The Frankenstein Chronicles preselling extremely well. Established titles such as Big Brother are traveling further than ever before, with a pilot series due to air in China for the first time this fall. So while there is still much do, we feel good about the progress in the company overall and about where we're headed.","So with that, we'll hand it over to all of you for any questions you might have. Reed?","Reed Nolte","Greg, now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffittNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Brian Nathanson","Thanks. I'll ask one to John on costs. John, you said that domestic cost growth was 4%, and that's the lowest we've seen in years. Is that a decent run rate for the fiscal year, or are there any timing issues that we should be aware of for the next three quarters?","John Nallen","Thanks, Michael. I think if you reflect back on what we said, what I said at year end, we expect the Cable segment expense growth rate to moderate very significantly this year, and it will be down to about half the rate of growth that we experienced in the last two years. In those two years, it was up around the mid-teens. So there's nothing that's changed in the three months that would cause us to change that outlook, either.","Michael Brian Nathanson","Okay. My other cost question is internationally, could you help us differentiate between the cost growth organically at Star versus Thick because there's some moving pieces you have going on. So what's the underlying cost growth for those two businesses?","John Nallen","I don't want to be so precise that we're down to the channel levels, but what I called out and I think James called out and we called out in the earnings release is we did have a significant decline focused on Star Sports because of the absence of the cost of that cricket series. So the most dramatic decline internationally would've been in Star Sports, right in line with what we're expecting.","Michael Brian Nathanson","Okay. Thanks, John.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks, Michael. Gregory, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.","Douglas Mitchelson","Thanks so much. I mean, Lachlan mentioned transformative change. I think investors are trying to understand the pace of that change and how aggressively you might invest against that imperative. And I know that John mentioned changing approach to [indiscernible] licensing as potentially one of the items that could impact growth in the future. At the same time last quarter, you talked about some of the growth drivers for fiscal 2017. Do you help investors understand, you know, over the last few months anything new in terms of your philosophy about how you're balancing driving growth after three-year investment cycles versus the need to invest in digital going forward? Thank you.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, Doug. I think, as Lachlan mentioned, it is a time of change as we all know in the business. But I think when we look at the present state of the business with respect to the growth that we're seeing and really IP streaming video construction, this is something that we're very excited about and we have been pretty aggressive on trying to create growth there, investing in our capability with respect to monetizing that viewership and doing it a better way, developing new products for customers. As well as with partners, for example, at our Hulu partnership, growing that business very aggressively and seeing very good results at this point.","So I think when we think about investing in these areas, you have already seen a lot of that in these sort of numbers and within our kind of inorganic - within our organic internal investments as we think about how we make programming, what rights we seek to control, then how we want to sell those things. With respect to specific decisions around, when doing SVOD partners, how we are exporting program across the full lifetime of the programming. Those are things that continually evolve, and I think it's really important for us to be able to be disruptive in those areas. I think is important for us not to cling to business rules that inevitably change and have been changing over the last number of decades.","We're in a business and in an industry that's been characterized more than anything else by really wave after wave of technological change that fundamentally creates better products for customers, creates more competition downstream, and we think in that environment we've always been best served to be able to innovate and disrupt ourselves. So I think with respect to how we think about investment, I don't want to get to, I don't want to get into sort of a backdoor way into 2017 guidance. But I would say that we look at the sorts of things we've been doing around growing our capability as well as licensing some new entrants in the marketplace on the right business terms.","And also increasing the business that we do with many of our existing partners who distribute our content. These are the sort of things we're focused on, and I think you'll see more activity with respect to that as those agreements are concluded and adjusted and as we find, you know, new ways to distribute the product going forward over the next year.","Douglas Mitchelson","All right. I tried. Thank you.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks, Doug. Gregory, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG. Please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is really more of a follow up on just kind of broad picture thinking on the SVOD topic. Why not, as you think about it, why not actually start building your own direct-to-consumer service? I know you've talked about it for a long time, but wondering, you continue to license content to Hulu among other platforms. I guess big picture, why Hulu, especially now that Hulu has an ad-free option, why is Hulu better than licensing to Netflix or to Amazon? And why did you allow Hulu to do an ad-free option, I guess? I'm curious why that was something the partnership wanted.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Rich, for the question. I guess just to step back a little bit, I mean, first of all, I think as I said earlier, we believe very strongly in Hulu and whose prospects. And as I said just a second ago in response to Doug's question, it's really crucial that we don't become overly beholden to our own incumbency. And I think that's a real, for any business, that's trying to move faster trying to grow. That's a real danger to what has to be very alive typo, and we have to be willing to take some risk but also to be innovative and to be disruptive.","And I think as you know, as leader of the business, and I think I speak for all of the leaders within the business, which is all the way through the business, because everybody has a responsibility to lead, we have to be disrupters if we're going to grow. So when we look at growing the IP streaming sort of our growing kind of business in IP streaming in the future, we're pretty excited about the innovation that we can bring to that marketplace, and we're working hard across the board both internally when we think about developing are authenticated apps, potentially direct-to-consumer offerings, some of our competitors have been out there with those. We haven't done that yet here, but for example in India with hot star, we've been very aggressive in building out a mobile video platform that we control and that we reach to customers with directly, we're working hard within Hulu as well to both grow the business absolutely but also to grow the offerings of the business, and we're really excited about our progress there.","With respect your question about ads, we're also really pleased with the progress we're making with respect to sort of add innovation. To both the premium ad-free services, which Hulu announced and launched, but also with expanding the opt-in engagement advertising that we've talked about in the past to the Hulu platform which we just announced yesterday. That's in addition to our own authenticated app services.","So fundamentally, in advertising, these innovations are about empowering the audience to decide the value of their attention, and that make sense to them, and it also makes a lot of sense to us, and we think pricing models around attention are going to be developing, and we want to be at the forefront of developing those and understanding how those work and how we can create, you know, the best return. And the scale of the Hulu inventory there and the scale of the Hulu audience is a great place to be innovative in that regard. They've been really embracing that.","Richard Greenfield","And you had mentioned, I think you mentioned that Hulu subs are up 60% year-over-year which is - in terms of net adds are up 60% which is an impressive number. How much is the - I know it's very recent times, but how significant is the ad free product driving incremental subscribers?","James Murdoch","Look, they have - Hulu hasn't disclose those numbers at this point. I think I'll leave it to them, and obviously in the spring with the upfront, there's going to be a lot of attention to that. But the growth is good, and we're - I think we're - I would say, at this point, pretty comfortable with the mix of growth in terms of ad free versus ad supported. And look, I think our commitment to Hulu is self-evident. We've invested a lot in it. We continue the license to it where it makes the most sense for our creative partners and us to do so. But also we want to grow our ad distribution as well, and I think we're seeking to license rights to distributors of all kinds if it's on the right terms. And I think the other thing that's changing, and this is maybe to the heart of your question is that the SVOD licensing business itself is changing pretty quickly and also their surprising new approaches and new ways that I think we can provide a great service to customers that you'll see over the next little while.","So I'd just say, in that environment of all of that going on, I think our opportunities do lie kind of leading in and being disruptive ourselves and not being afraid of that. And look, I think it's consistent with the way we've managed and the way the business has grown over many, many years from disrupting the U.S. broadcast business with Fox broadcasting so many years ago, to disrupting the European television business with the three different Sky's and disrupting advertising and the broadcast business today with Hulu and other things over the current period and the next few years, I think is a real opportunity to create enormous value. So look, I think that's one of the most important sort of cultural traits in our business, and it's one that we're going to continue to encourage and nurture because I think it has to exist everywhere in this company.","James Murdoch","Thank you, Rich.","Lachlan Murdoch","Greg, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Michael Morris","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow up on Hulu and really just understanding your comfort with the price of the product relative to the utility given that it's really become a great consumer product and a robust product. At $12, it feels like it could potentially be cannibalistic to your existing business model. So how do you get comfort, number one, that you're not, in fact leading yourselves down a path of cannibalism?","And two, maybe what levers, what you're looking for, what levers you could pull to both deliver that quality experience but also protect your economics? And then just one quick housekeeping; is there anything on the domestic affiliate revenue side that's seasonal in terms of puts and takes or is that number continue to be a pretty steady with respect to absolute dollar and growth? Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, Michael. Look, just to clarify Hulu, I think one of the things, one thing that is important to note is that the current - the way the business looks today with all of the different services and subscription video on demand as well as the MBPTD marketplace, all of these services are going to change, and I think you've seen competitors take pricing, you've seen new tier, the new products emerge, and I think it's important to note that there's not necessarily a steady-state. In fact, it's one of pretty rapid evolution and innovation. So I think with respect to the ad-free pricing at Hulu and the delta between the ad supported and the ad-free, as you would imagine, that was a source of robust debate. But at the end of the day, the business just had to move forward and try, and we're learning a lot from that.","And I think pricing may change, but also as a mentioned before, we're very focused on thinking about how come these services also expand their offerings and create new price points with new content or other things in them? So I think that's going to evolve, and I wouldn't necessarily say it's a steady state today. With respect to cannibalization, cannibalism, I'll refrain from commenting on. I think it's inevitable that new services and new competition both grow the overall market but also impact customers to other services. And we're very focused on how we think about monetization in that environment and how we make sure that overall we look at the whole business our approach to growing the streaming business very aggressively is one that's going to be more attractive for us?","And personally I think over time, is not necessarily a straight line, I think over time, the streaming entertainment business and streaming television business is much more attractive with opportunities renovation in terms of ad load, and pricing, subscription pricing, premium ad-free models, as well as the discoverability of our programming across, you know, for customers it's just a very attractive - you got a very attractive set of attributes for customers and I think for our business as well. And, but it's pretty early days in terms of finding all of the different ways that we can move it forward and we can innovate there. And your second question...","Lachlan Murdoch","As a housekeeping point, Michael, the question on the affiliate fees. So we said at the beginning of the year, like on Michael's question, that we would have low double-digit affiliate fee growth for the year, I mean, led by the U.S., this is right in line with that. So there's nothing unusually sees and all about the growth we experienced in the quarter against what we expect to happen for the year.","James Murdoch","Yes.","Michael Morris","Great. Thank you.","Lachlan Murdoch","Greg, can we have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank","Okay. Thank you very much. I want to actually follow up on the answer to your last question regarding innovation, in particular, James. You guys have always been ahead of the curve on giving us some really useful color around viewership around nontraditional platforms. You did more so today. I'm trying to figure out how we can use them to model the business. So if go back to something, I think you guys said total viewership on Fox Broadcasting Network was up like 10%. Can you remind us how much of that was sort of, you know, was in the traditional C3, C7 window, whatever the Nielsen kind of - Nielsen window you sold it in?","And then can you give us what the viewership was outside that window and remind us of what the monetization of that viewership is or at least give us a sense of what the potential upside of the monetization is given that you know what audience is and you must have a sense of where you can monetize it over time. Then lastly, Lachlan talked about the growth in nonlinear viewership. What are you doing with the data? You must be coming up with some pretty interesting data from the growth in this nonlinear viewership that I would imagine is extremely valuable in both monetization and devising a strategy for building your business going forward. How do you think about the data? Thanks very much.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, David. So with respect to the break-in so first of all, it is more complicated, right, so when you said, can we help you with modeling how that works, I'm thinking to myself, yes, maybe you can help us model it how it works. What's complicated about it, and it really, I think it illustrates the point around measurement systems evolving, that Lachlan made earlier, which is what we're really focused on his what was our total audience last night and the day before and last week? And that was made up of customers and viewers watching live things, things a day old, things four days old, things 30 days old, and in some cases, things many months old.","And what you want to really do is get a picture of that overall viewership and it's not easy to come by and it lags because the measurement systems and all of those things don't always synch up when we don't get those numbers in the most primary ways that we would like. So the total picture of the audience is more complex. That said, just to break it down a little bit for you, in the season to date, the live viewing, as I mentioned before, was just under half. Right? So 50% was more than that. And so it's about, I think live viewing was about 40%, high 40s percentage there.","And then Hulu made up sort of in the teens, and the balance was, VOD, a very small amount for our authenticated apps, which we're working on authentication pathways and stuff to improve there, and sometime shifting on DVR. So the balance is definitely moving towards obviously time shifted and on-demand. And from a sales point of view, about half of our inventory was sold on a C7 basis in the period.","So that's sort of where that breaks down. But it is something that's really evolving. And I think when we think about how we instrument the business going forward and how we measure the business and then deal with advertisers and all of our clients and customers on that, those are things that are going to continue to evolve. But we're very focused on the total audience in a given time period, and then we build that up. So when we said to you that total audience was up 10% in the season to date, entertainment programming, that really was the accumulated viewership, literally on a per minute basis relative to the previous year. And a lot of that was driven by the growth in seven-day and 30-day viewership there. And, look, we think that it's really, really encouraging that the audience is moving towards these on-demand platforms, and particularly where they're moving towards Hulu, where we can really innovate and monetize that audience.","And with respect to your second question just on data, your right, it is, it's very interesting. And, we are - it is very early days because the consumption curve is pretty dramatic. And that's something that we're really using today to understand both how we use our air better in terms of promo inventory, sales inventory, et cetera, how we understand how customers move between different shows and different platforms. But there are also gaps in that data obviously working with third-party partners. That is a big focus for us, and we think it's one of the - data opportunity is. One of the great characteristics of an IP streaming TV business in the future is the ability to have that data, the ability to use that to improve your products and services and monetize the viewership and the audience in the right way with respect to pricing, the attention of the audience correctly either for them or for advertisers.","David Bank","Thank you, David.","James Murdoch","Thank you.","Lachlan Murdoch","Greg, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks. Just two quick ones, or hopefully quick. John, last quarter, you gave some assumptions around the guidance, particularly on advertising, that TV, I think you said, would be flattish, cable or domestic cable up mid to high single digits. Is that still your expectation after a quarter?","John Nallen","Yes. It is early days. And we're three months into it. Obviously a lot of the network programming is still ahead of us. But at this point, we are still in that zone.","Benjamin Swinburne","Great. And then, just, James, bringing the conversation more to the here and now, a couple of years ago, you guys decided to invest and turn, I think, the Speed channel into Fox Sports 1. You've made of a lot of investments at FS and that family of networks. And that's really, I think in the eyes of the investor, driving growth over the next few years. So I'm wondering if you could just talk about where we are in the sort of EBITDA trajectory, particularly for those. They're not new assets per se, but assets that probably were profitable. You invested a lot into them, and now we're hoping to see sort of the harvest of those investments over the next few years. Any color you can add would be helpful as we think about sort of the medium term.","James Murdoch","Sure. Thanks, Ben. I think I'd add another sort stool to that, leg to that stool, I guess, which is the investment that we've made in India in STAR, which is also one of the things that has been the investment we are making, but also, I think, when you look forward, generates a lot of growth. So with respect to FS1, Fox Sports one, is fully in contract for the full year this year. And we think that's a great achievement. We've invested a lot in programming, a lot in putting a great product on screen for people. And I think that the launch and the first two years in this project, as I said in my comments earlier, has really gone to plan or ahead of plan pretty much across the board, both in terms of audience as well as the P&L. So that's sort of where that is. And we see really good growth there going forward.","Now obviously one of the key things that drives that is affiliate fee increases. We have a lot of visibility on a lot of that, but there are as new affiliate agreements come - go forward both in terms of distribution and price, we see an opportunity to grow there. But those will come in steps.","FX we think is really - the FX suite more broadly is really one of the core creative franchises in the business today, and we think is very, very promising. We see good growth there, but obviously the investments in originals has been very high, and that's something that has impacted profit other than it would be.","And at STAR, we really took 100% of the profit in the entertainment business and invested it in building a sports business there after the acquisition of ESPN Star Sports. We're seeing very, very good progress there. Last year, this year just gone, was really the peak year of investments in that, so as we see continued growth in the entertainment business there and the growth rate of cost in the - or rather the costs spike in the sports business and ameliorate pretty dramatically, we've got - you kind of get a double-whammy there. And the growth of the STAR business in terms of EBITDA will be substantial this year and for the next few years as that sports investment kind of backs out.","So I think I would say we feel pretty - we feel really good about all those things. And most importantly, I think as we looked at this a number of years ago and said, listen, we're going to invest in these core brands, we're going to invest in - we're going to invest actually in getting out of a lot of smaller brands, little things that weren't really moving the dial for customers. We think that's been really successful. And when I look at our discussions with our wholesale distributors, when I look at the way we're licensing, when I look at the volume and quality of the product that we have and our fan mail, it's really - it's paying dividends in the marketplace as we negotiate new distribution contracts, as we license things in a new way, and as we grow the audience overall, as I detailed earlier.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, Ben. Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Thanks. There's been a lot of discussion about the health of the ad market, and now that you've got a couple of years of FS1 on top of the rest of the portfolio, can you talk about the health of sports ad market relative to the entertainment piece, and to what extent increased programming across TV broadly on the sports front may be affecting pricing power or the balance between supply and demand?","James Murdoch","Thanks, John. I think the health of the sports advertising business is pretty good we've seen I would say pretty much across the board in our sports portfolio. I think it speaks to the increased scarcity of big live events, mass events that can deliver big audiences consistently. And at this point, I think it's early days in the season obviously in the NFL, but it feels reasonably good and strong going forward. As John mentioned before, we had one week less than the year before, but that reverses out and we get that week back later in the season. So I think it looks reasonably healthy.","And the baseball ratings I mentioned earlier and revenue associated with that was pretty strong. So I feel - I think we feel pretty good about it. And the big events on FS1 like the Women's World Cup, things like that, have been really tremendous. I mean, the other day, I think it was just last Sunday, we had a really tremendous day of sports on the network and on FS1. And all-in, it was a $100 million day. So that felt - that's pretty good.","John Janedis","Okay. Maybe a quick follow up also, James. Thanks. Regarding your comments around multi-platform viewing and audience, can you talk about when you expect some of the Nielsen changes to kick in from a measurement perspective, and is it the assumption that modelization quickly follows as the bulk of the upfront? It just seems like the modelization piece is perpetually a year away.","James Murdoch","So I think - I wouldn't say it's perpetually a year away, but I think it necessarily lags the audience growth. And you generally try to focus on audience growth and then create a center of gravity, create demand around that audience, and I think that's, that's just the way we've approached it. So I feel actually pretty good in the progress there. And I would say that the Nielsen changes, C7 changes, et cetera, are relevant, but just as relevant is our ability - moving to the question before - is our ability to gather up the data around viewing and frankly articulate that in a clear way to clients and advertisers and also give them the tools that are easy for them to start to innovate and experiment themselves.","We're really happy to be able to get engagement units launched on Hulu, announced it yesterday, and we have Mondelez as a number of Mondelez brands really as sort of a launch partner to do that and has a good volume of inventory there. So I think this is picking up pretty quickly in its combination not just of the Nielsen - it's a combination of the Nielsen Ratings changes and getting a currency there that's established but also a lot of other viewership data coming from a variety of platforms and we work with all those, we work with the third-party services, some Rentrak, et cetera, but also internal data in terms of what we're streaming and we're doing it and those numbers there. So it's a blend of all those things, and so far, we're seeing reasonably good appetite for that, although it's obviously coming from a smaller base.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, John. Greg, we have one more - next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. My question is on the RSN. You highlighted the recent strength at your RSN around the World Series. I guess can you give us some perspective on how we should think of the RSN from a financial view versus your other cable properties? How demand for advertising rate volume versus also demand how the outlook for maybe sub revenue looks, just maybe relative to your other cable businesses.","James Murdoch","We're very fond of our RSN's, as we've talked about before. I think the performance of the RSN's that I outlined earlier is super encouraging. We're seeing ratings growth from a competitive perspective, real leadership in a lot of those local markets. And it really just speaks to the fact that the RSN businesses is a business built around the tribal nature of sports and the passion that people have for these teams and these brands, and what we try to do is balance the portfolio so that we have the strength in the right regions, we try to balance the long-term of that business with respect to renewals, team agreements, et cetera, so that we can provide a lot of value for our team partners there and get the value in the marketplace for them. The majority of that business from a revenue perspective is affiliate revenue, so it's less driven by ratings and really the local ratings are more a measure of demand and really help us with respect to pricing on a wholesale basis, whereas most of them are not big advertising businesses because they are generally very, very local.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, Alexia. Greg, I think at this point we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay, that question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","All right. Ending it up here. I'll try to keep it brief seeing the time. So just quickly, on the television operating expense line just wonder if you could help us from the outside understand anything that helped drive that actually down, I guess, year over year. I mean, there seems to be plenty of exciting new shows on your networks and your broadcast network so anything on timing related or just efficiencies there, what's going on would be helpful. And then secondly real quickly and this one, James, I know you already talked a lot about STAR, so just to put one final punctuation, it's such a big incremental contributor of cash flow growth apparently over the next many years when we think about that billion dollars number that was mentioned a couple of years ago. Anything you could say on the trajectory between now and then, what drives that? Is it just a steady rate of subscriber growth with less cost? Is their marketing invested? Is there some inflection required? Anything to think about the pacing of that and when we'll see it would be helpful. Thanks, guys.","James Murdoch","Okay. Todd, let me deal with the STAR answer first. Look, I think the inflection point was really this year when we hit the sort of peak sports investment, because the business generally on an underlying basis, the entertainment business is already well on its way and it's substantial profit and I think we've disclosed this, over $300 million this year I think in EBITDA. So it's really the eating, the taking that investment, taking all that profit and reinvesting that into creating this new business in sports, we think really adds a total new dimension and real set and scale, the real scale over the business there. The inflection point is when that peaks, and that peaked this year. So we see - yes, this last year that just ended.","So when we look at the future of that business, while I'm not going to say it's a straight line, there's always some ups and downs here and there, but the profit growth will start to be significant this year, and will continue towards that billion dollars target at the present conditions being consistent towards the end of this decade or thereabouts at the turn of the decade. So I think that feels really good. It's totally dependent on continued creative excellence across that business, so there's a lot of execution risk as there is in all these businesses. But we've got - we feel very, very good about the products we have, about the brands, about the company there and we want to aim high with it. We think it can really change our lives.","John Nallen","So, Todd, on your question on the TV OpEx, there's a few factors driving on a comparative basis. First, at the network, earlier in the quarter, we had lower costing programming repeats versus some of the original programming that we had a year ago, same quarter. We've got lower programming at the station group given that some programming is just rolling off there. And of course, given the revenue impact, we have lowered costs for the NFL week moving from this quarter to the following, to the third quarter. Offsetting that, we did have one higher marketing costs at the network given that we launched, you know, clearly a schedule and morning series than we've had in several years. So that balance a bit of the cost reduction from earlier.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, Todd. At this point, we are out of time, and I want to thank everybody for joining today's call.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay up after 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today through November 14.

Welcome to Twenty-First Century Fox Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Co-Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2014, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filings.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to John.","John Nallen","Alright, thanks Reed. As you have seen in today's earnings release, we\u2019ve reported another quarter of financial results led by double digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our Cable Networks.","Note that due to the sale on November of our DBS to Sky, our reported financial results include the consolidation of these businesses this year for our partial quarter of ownership as compared to a full quarter consolidation a year ago. So to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we\u2019ve providing total adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA that excludes the DBS business in all periods. Most of the comments that follow will be on a suggested basis and their press release providing the reconciliations between the reported results in the suggested basis.","So second quarter adjusted total company revenues were $7.4 billion, up 10% compared to the second quarter a year ago, reflecting double digit increases in our Cable Network and Film segments. Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.7 billion, up 12% over the $1.51 billion from a year ago. This increase reflect strong results of the Cable Network segment, improvements led by costs at the Television segment and similar film contributions to year ago.","Note that unfavorable foreign currency movement reduced our overall total EBITDA growth rate in the quarter by 6 percentage points. From a bottom line perspective, we\u2019ve reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $6.2 billion as compared to the $982 million we\u2019ve reported in the second quarter a year ago. This year\u2019s results include $5 billion of gains reported in other net, which was principally from the company\u2019s sale of the DBS businesses to Sky.","Also included in this year\u2019s equity earnings of affiliate results is net after tax income of approximately $100 million related to Sky\u2019s gains on the sales of certain of its investments, partially offset by their purchase price amortization and expenses related to their acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland.","Excluding net income effect of these net equity gains and last year\u2019s gain from participating in Sky share repurchase program, as well as the amounts reflected in other net, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.53 this year versus $0.33 in the prior year. This quarter\u2019s adjusted earnings per share includes a recognitions of various tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 31%.","Also note that the net income and EPS contributions of the DBS segment in each were not significant.","Now let me provide some additional context that the performance - on a performance of few of our businesses and let\u2019s start with the Cable Network segment. The overall total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 16% increase in affiliate revenues and 8% advertising revenue growth.","With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 19% primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News, as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network this year also contributed to our growth and excluding the contribution from YES, we had a low double digit domestic affiliate fee increase. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 7%, reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 20%.","The second quarter Cable segment advertising revenue growth of 8% reflects domestic advertising increases of 11% led by the FX Networks, FS1 and FXX. Reported international advertising grew 5% but we had 10% growth on a local currency basis driven by strong year-over-year increases at STAR.","Total Cable segment EBITDA in the second quarter of $1.16 billion was up 12% over the prior year reflecting the strong revenue growth which was partially offset by a planned 16% increase in expenses, primarily related to a higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. The negative impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by 6%.","EBITDA at our domestic channels increase 13% from higher contribution at our establish networks as well as the impact of consolidating the US Network this year. EBITDA at FOX Sports 1 was below last year, reflecting the planned increase programming costs associated with the inaugural broadcast of the Major League Baseball playoffs.","Reported international channel contributions increased 8%, a strong double digit local currency growth at both FIC and the STAT Entertainment channels was partially offset by the continued investment we\u2019re making in STAR Sports and the negative impact from foreign exchange rates.","At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $290 million, an increase of $72 as compared to the prior year result. This higher contribution is primarily due to lower programming costs reflecting the absence of X Factor this year moving up Glee into the March quarter and the shift of the Baseball League Championship Series to Fox Sports 1.","Total segment revenues were consistent with the year-ago quarter a strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenues. As ad revenue decline is primarily due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network and stations offset impart by higher local political ad revenues related to the mid-term elections.","Turning to our Film segment, we\u2019ve reported second quarter EBITDA of $336 million, a similar result to that of a year ago. As higher film studio contributions were offset by fewer television series deliveries.","Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $276 million or 11% driven by several successful theatrical releases including Gone Girl and the Maze Runner. The majority of these higher theatrical revenues were offset by increased releasing cost for both these films as well as Exodus and Night at the Museum 3.","Now before I turn to guidance what we make a couple of capital related comments. We ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in cash and 19.1 billion in gross debts and the cash position reflects the net proceeds from the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland during the quarter. With regard to the stock buyback, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of FOXA from July 1st through today and we\u2019re on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12 month timeframe we previously announced.","And today, the company increased its dividend and declared a semiannual dividend of $0.15, this translates to a $0.30 dividend on an annual basis the 20% increase over the previous dividend payout.","Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. As a reminder for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all period resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.","On last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we mentioned that we had seen some puts and takes as against our original expectations for fiscal 2015 with negative variances at that time primarily relating to the strengthening dollar and underperformance at the broadcast network as against our original expectations. Since that update, these trends have continued and at levels about what we expected.","Over the last three months, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly further reducing the translated U.S. dollar earnings from our international businesses, most notably from the Fox International Channels. Assuming exchange rate stay where they are today the strengthen dollar has now further reduced our fiscal 2015 EBITDA expectations by an additional $100 million plus resulting in a total full year effect across the company of around $250 versus last year.","At our television broadcast business, the network and the stations, we now know that market and rating challenges were more significant than we expected. On the entertainment side, Empire and American Idol are doing well competitively, but our ratings overall have underperformed and our expectation that the national and local added markets would gain momentum going into calendar 2015 has not occurred.","On the sports side, our biggest college football games in the quarter were all up sided wins with an average score of 52 to 10 thereby impacting the viewership.","At our Film segment, we continue to anticipate that the full year contribution will exceed our original expectation but now by a lesser amount than thought three months ago, primarily reflecting lower than anticipated Box Office results from our holiday releases as well as closing on the transfer of our Shine business to the Endemol joint venture earlier than we expected. This will result in the elimination of Shine\u2019s EBITDA contributions for the rest of the year as it moves to our equity affiliate line.","Despite our change and expectation around currencies, broadcast TV and our Film segment, our domestic cable network businesses continue to perform right in line with our expectation.","So considering these factors and based on all the assumption inherent in our current projections, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage grow rate for fiscal 2015 will be toward the lower end of the mid-single digit range above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level fiscal 2014.","With that let me turn it over to Chase.","Chase Carey","Let me begin by expanding on John\u2019s comments on fiscal 2015 guidance. Reality is that the majority of our businesses and key initiatives are on track and our competitive position is strong as ever in most every area. However, two issues, foreign currency and broadcast advertising shortfall simply became too large to offset. Let me address these issues first and talk about the larger picture.","There isn\u2019t a lot to add what John said about the currency issues. We\u2019re practical, we\u2019re addressing hedging strategies to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations not the currency impact today.","On the broadcast side network and stations, the issue was primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network exacerbated by adverse industry trend in linier network ratings and the television advertising markets, which combined leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.","Looking forward to 2016, [indiscernible]. Let me just start. I\u2019ll start again that on the web, whether any of that came on.","Let me begin by expanding on John\u2019s comments on fiscal 2015 guidance. Reality is that the majority of our businesses and key initiatives are on track and our competitive position is strong as ever in most every area. However, two issues, foreign currency and broadcast advertising shortfall simply became too large to offset. Let me address these issues first and talk about the larger picture.","There isn\u2019t a lot to add what John said about the currency issues. We\u2019re practical, we\u2019re addressing hedging strategies to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations not the currency impact today.","On the broadcast side network and stations, the issue was primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network exacerbated by adverse industry trend in linier network ratings and the television advertising markets, which combined leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.","Looking forward to 2016, we expect these same themes to continue. The majority of our business is strong and on track. Whenever currency moves this year, will adversely impact 2016 profits by about $200 million, which is on top of the approximately $250 hit to expected 2016 profits by currency shits last year. A total hit of about $450 million to our original 2016 projection in August 2013.","We also expect the next 21 months to be a period of investment in new programming at our broadcast network. In addition, we anticipate the industry trends impacting advertising will be slightly larger than previously expected as both advertising and viewership continues to migrate the digital platforms.","Our original target for 2016 profits was $9 billion which adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Sky and Shine will be about $8 billion. Currently our broadcast business is not what we expected it to be at this time an external market forces like currency have been more unfavorable than expected. While we still expect solid double digit overall next year due to strength of most of our businesses, the challenges in currency and broadcasting now lead to an expected 2016 profit in the mid $7 billion range.","Currency disappointed the function of our targets for this and text. We take this target seriously. While our overall goal is not the hit a short terms profit target but to build shareholder value so it\u2019s permanent by the overall momentum in competitive strength of our businesses and have the position the grow and succeed in light of broader economic, technological and global trends. If our goals to hit a short term profit target, we pursue efforts like cutting marketing and programming at the expensive future profits. We\u2019ll not do that because we believe shareholder value is built to long term growth.","In term so an overall goal, we could not be more excite about the future. First as noted earlier, most of our businesses and key initiatives are on target and competitively is strong as ever. Affiliate revenues and retransmission fees which are the foundation of our future are on are ahead of our plans. Among key initiative, we\u2019ve began like ones again reset the FOX News rate reflect its importance in the market with new agreements now in place with four MVPDs represent over a quarter of the market and Fox Sports 1 now has affiliation agreements in place with all major MVPDs reflect a new FS1 rate.","Our domestic and international cable channels group to represent about 70% of our profit on track on a local currency basis as of new channel initiatives launched in the last few years.","Our news, sports and entertainment channels continue to build in a leadership position with truly unique and focus brands around the world. For example, FX is really less competing basic cable networks behind with programming that makes is appear the premium networks, while FXX is that an exciting new dimension of the group is the fastest growing network in cable.","Our Film and Television businesses have great momentum and continue to distinguish themselves as industry leaders. Our Film business finished calendar 2014 with record breaking world-wide Box Office. We locked up key sports content around the world through the rest of its decade to assurance access to this critical content and provide cost stability.","Even the earlier noted areas, we face challenges, we are excited about the future. At our broadcast business, our issues have been ones of exaction not structure. The foundation is in place with retransmission revenues ahead of plan with significant room to grow and our major sports rights are in place under long term contracts. Our challenge has been the networks entertainment programming.","After a few tough years, we believe we turn the corner with a new network management team to inherent our current broadcast issues that has brought fresh momentum and energy to the business, which allows the top business to predict but we are excited about new hits like Empire and Backstrom as well as a dynamic slate of new event programming. Our competitive lists have already shown different of couple of hits to make. That will take us times to get the broadcast business to where it should be in terms of profitability. The next year plus will be a period of investment with a priority focused on building hit shows not maximizing profits, the profits will follow.","We still believe our broadcast business has a strategic and financial future and its promising is ever. The time and the value of hit programming continues to grow exponentially, our broadcast network plays a unique role in launching defining events like Empire.","Turning to the broader industry issues, the digital transition continues to be a glass awful [ph] story for us. The moment of advertising dollars and shit of our consumer viewing is clearly going to continue as I think it\u2019s fair to say that its trend recently has been in a bit faster than many expected. These issues will put short term pressure on our business but represent longer term exciting growth opportunities, it will able to deliver more efficient and effective capabilities to advertisers that will monetize viewership on digital platforms and create new offer for consumers on these platforms.","Our content brands that consumers and advertisers want to access first and foremost and are committed to building the capabilities to meet that demand. Recent initiatives like the restructuring our bad sales organization and the acquisition of the true[X] are focused on that goal.","In closing, let me touch on return of capital on our balance sheet. We are well aware that the recent completion of the Sky transaction ones again have their balance sheet that are in liquid position. We will complete our $6 million buyback as planned but that will still leave us with excess liquidity. Now in fiscal year end, our board will continue to consider next steps. Our priorities for capital remain the same. And that set our core businesses to grow long term value, opportunistic flexibility and return of capital to shareholders.","We continue to pursue our goal and achieving an efficient balance sheet will do so in a deliberate manner. Like simply, our goal continues to be building shareholder value by growing our business while returning capital to shareholders and we believe we\u2019re on track to achieve that goal.","Thank you. I will turn it back to Reed.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Chase. And now Chase, James and John will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. You line is open.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. I guess my question deals with the investment in the business and James you could talk about STAR in India in particular and help us think about the profit potential of that business, I think a while ago you guys had laid out a plan for EBITDA growth there but the currencies have moved against you. Help us thing about the opportunity there particular in line of some of the non-rupee that cost you have on the sport side?","And similar question maybe chased on FOX Network, it sounds like your plan is to sort of double down on a phrase but investment more in prime-time entertainment and push the programming. Can you give us some color on sort of how do you want to go and what we should be thinking about in terms of programming cost growth at FOX in couple of years? Thanks.","Chase Carey","Sure. James you want to.","James Murdoch","Thanks Ben. I think the last time when we talked about the sort of the profits that are pathway for the Indian business and actually since then the currency has been reasonably stable over the last sort of I guess nine months now. So I don\u2019t think that had an additional impact going forward from what we saw then. But essentially you know the STAR Entertainment business, the local language and the regional language there is very profitable today, very attractive business and really where we\u2019re investing a lot of those profits to build the sport business alongside that which we think we really have a transformational effect on the business since the acquisition of the half interest of ESPN STAR Sports that we didn\u2019t own previously.","And I think what we\u2019re seeing now is right the peak year of investment in fact these coming quarter with the Cricket World Cup and series of events really making that heavy investment right now. But we that churning vis-\u00e0-vis quickly, I mean we have pretty good certainly on what those rights costs up like for the STAR Sports business. We\u2019re launching two new sports channels, two HD channels actually just in the next month to continue to grow the portfolio.","And we think over five year basis, this business STAR India is the very, very profitable business, we think we get to north of - I\u2019ve said in the past that a north of 500 million of profit and do it with some pace and some velocity.","And I think investing in programming and investing on screen for our customers is it been you\u2019ll see everywhere around the business, we really think that\u2019s the business that we are in and something that you know it\u2019s super important for us and it\u2019s going to deliver a lot of long terms growth domestically here as well as around the world.","Chase Carey","I think I should say on the FOX on the network side on broadcasting I mean it\u2019s not feeling doubling I think I mean in many ways what I am trying to communicate is what\u2019s our priory and I think our priority is really building hits first of all most. And I guess I made the comment you know if we want to. Fine, just improve profits, we squeeze programming and squeeze marketing and we get the right move.","So I don\u2019t like it\u2019s to be many ways you know it is making sure we\u2019ve got a bench of programming as we try and develop these. I think this year we felt we were a little thin in terms of having available. I think we always know not every show is going to work then we got to make sure we have appropriate flexibility to build.","But I think what we\u2019re really talking about is stabilizing the broadcast and providing a platform to grow but I think that real growth comes in the couple of years not in next 12 months. So I think the next year will be period more stabilizing, stabilizing that business and putting it on our path to grow. But - and if I think I am talking more priorities and I think to the degree it\u2019s spending. In reality some of our more expensive programming and like something like Glee is ending its run. So that is obviously there are some cost that will go away, will not recur as we invested new shows.","But I think if you say what the investment, it\u2019s probably you have a bit more flexibility and a bit more programming to launch next year to enable us to have a few more shorts that creating the hits that are the foundations for future. Obviously Empire and Dad can give us some exciting building blocks to grow off it. But it\u2019s not a significant increase in cost. Again speaking more to what we think is the priority for the coming year.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thanks Ben. Next question please, operator.","Operator","We will go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. Let me ask Chase and James. First I wanted to know [indiscernible], what\u2019s your view of participating in a product like digital offer which may not carry all your channels especially RSNs? And then of the FOX side given that Gary and Dana leadership, how does FOX Studio plan in that need to maybe have more benchmark, can you shift more and more hours at the network?","James Murdoch","Yeah I guess we talk - I\u2019ll start with the first. You know look I think these digital platforms are obviously very important part of a future. We\u2019re spending a lot of time sort of trying to engage with third parties to hang on own and now this is what makes sense for us in terms of developing them. I am not going to comment on any one particular offer and we don\u2019t - so we don\u2019t have announcements today, we are working on a lot of things. I think well now something when potentially work, we\u2019re ready to do it. I expect this to be an area where we are busy and do move forward but we\u2019re not kind of well-structured to make press releases.","You know I think what\u2019s important then I am sure I assume the date is they offers its all resonate with the consumer, I think a lot of - a lot of what\u2019s been out there so far seems to be whether it\u2019s driven by transactions or deals or something or other consideration. I think we want to see can we bring things that are additive to our business and I think at the start we have to make sure what we do in this space as we do another place, it\u2019s additive to our business but brings new opportunities and interesting experiences to consumers and whether that\u2019s through a richer experience, a better interface and more choice.","Again I think what we offer consumers today in many ways to pretty attractive proposition. But clearly their segments were not reaching in the right way and there are opportunities for us to expand and grow that and we\u2019re going to be active there, but we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about it as well and make sure it\u2019s done in a way that is additive to our business as a whole as we go forward.","And on TCFTV, I guess an important part and one of the core strategic reason putting them together. It is increasingly I think it\u2019s - we\u2019re not allowed in this. A lot of the upside of what our network represents in terms of launching programming is realized on the products, on the context side of it. So the real win-win for us is to launch content as we own, it doesn\u2019t mean we are not going to have third party content on a network we will because realistically we want to have the best content possible when it does. We don\u2019t sell content to third party networks we will do that as well. But clearly that sweet spot you know is there a network to be able to create assets that we own.","And I think by putting them together under roof, we think we certainly create, meet those opportunities more available to us and certainly stream and decision making make the ability to identify needs and sure we are doing everything possible to maximize the opportunities to launch a hit show is done by having that studio and the network work together. But it is one of the core benefits that we love to in putting that studio in the network under Gary and Dana\u2019s leadership.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Michael. Okay, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. From the line of Douglas Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead. The line is open.","Douglas Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Chase and James, you\u2019ve had a lot of focus in the path of fiscal \u201916 given the select from all. I am wondering by fiscal \u201916 how much of the growth like always complete for FOX, you\u2019ve already talked broadcast in STAR, so maybe just thinking about, you mentioned Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2 has all fields done, there is always concerns with the RSN for scheme packages whether traditional online and. Where are we sort of as you look forward beyond fiscal \u201916 you know how of the growth has been captured, how much is left?","And just quickly for John, if you could breakdown the local currency international affiliate fee revenue growth of 20% for us, what were the drivers? That be helpful, thank you.","James Murdoch","I think we honestly our best growth to have us. I mean in all - and that obviously we\u2019ve certainly applied some of the newer initiatives like FS1 or sports internationally but excited I think talked FOX News which is they get stronger and we are ones again resetting that business, past business I think we are just really moving to now to really full distribute, full competitive distribution. So when I look at our portfolio channels both the establish ones and the newer ones, I think a lot of I think international marketplace literally if you look at round the world has got - is certainly somewhere mid-stream in terms of reaching its full potential varies by region but there as enormous amount of growth.","We talked before about India where that is in terms of what we think that business as we more thorough this decade. You and ultimately I really mean what I say when I talked about additional platforms and taking event both direct and through other parties. I think for those who have - we really believe must have content, it\u2019s sweet spot in a digital world, people - it\u2019s the content people that want to watch, the RSNs, the reality and to so being sports cost but there are also the product that\u2019s most in demand.","And I think hit product is going to grow exponentially in value and importance and I think those that have the - have a breath of hit unique content will be ideally position to take advantage of all these platforms and create new offers and new propositions for consumers and opportunities to engage more directly with consumer in terms of developing those offers, monetizing the viewership, developing databases and the like.","So I think in many ways - I think that will obviously put short term pressure because the pressure short terms will not - will take time to build the vehicles that we apply the short term pressers. But as we go forward, I think it\u2019s an area of tremendous growth for us. I mean I think those who have and gain get unique content brand, that scale have really in the sweet spot to take advantage of these things.","So I think are core businesses have a lot of growth left here and overseas in their traditional models not that some of those models are maturing but our business is clearly when we look at what we are doing with FOX News, look at where we are with retransmission rates and potential there. We think value of our content holds up. Yes, you\u2019ll - as we said I think that the cable bundle really is pretty much in line with our expectation as I said before probably spring but I think it\u2019s got real legs to it and still it\u2019s going to be a cornerstone for a long time. But as we go forward, these digital platforms really open up a whole new dimensioning growth on top of the opportunities we have in the traditional model.","John Nallen","And Doug, dealing with your question on local currency affiliate revenue international, it was led by FIC STAR had growth nice growth but FIC led it and business breakdown inside of that is in our sports channels it was primarily distribution gains where as in our entertainment channels it was blended between both distribution gains as well as rate increases.","Douglas Mitchelson","Thanks John, thank you very much, very helpful.","Reed Nolte","Thanks Doug. Operator, next question please.","Operator","From the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente","Thank you very much. I have one question for James and one for Chase. James, over the past year or so other media commenced and made strategic investments internationally in order to achieve more global scale, perhaps sale that FOX already had, so for example Channel 5, Euro Sport and Chellomedia, as you look to sustain you growth in markets outside the U.S., can you just give us a sense for how you are balancing organic investment versus M&A?","And then for Chase, you noted the strong ad growth domestically from the FX Networks in the quarters, it does seem like ratings at FX have picked up nicely but FX ratings themselves had seemed to get soft. So I know you guys have moved some content from FX to FXX, but just wondering is there any concern on those networks and can they establish their own distinct identities from each other? Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks Anthony, it\u2019s James. I guess and first of all I would you know our buyers generally is to and particularly given the position that we have in markets outside the U.S. today is generally to invest in ourselves and to continue to execute and operate these business where we have - where we have reasonable position. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re pretty happy with the mix that we have around the place, it\u2019s a - we\u2019ve completed a number of transactions over the last number of years from the acquisition of the Asianet business local regional languages in India which really gave us a new dimension to that business to the acquisition of that partner stakes and ESPN and STAR Sports and Fox Pan-American Sports and so.","And I think we\u2019ll continue to look at acquisitions where we can simplify our business where we can really add a dimension and really add velocity and pace to the business. But we\u2019re not looking fill whole bunch of gaps if you will. I think we have a good position internationally. And the Chase\u2019s point before about long term growth, I guess really is one of the drivers of our long terms growth, when we look at our emerging market\u2019s position particularly in India, in part of Asia and other parts of Asia and I Latin America we feel very, very strong about the position. That\u2019s not to say that we know real things out, we look opportunistically the verity of things as you would expect. But we generally at this point I think would have a buyers towards investing in our self-other than have built on kind of technical things that can help us accelerate.","Chase Carey","And I think at FX you know first I think it\u2019s pretty much where we expected. I mean I think we expected for a couple of year because we\u2019re trying to build FXX side by side with FX, we\u2019re going to stretch it a bit. And so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a surprise to us and ramp up program this allow two channels then obviously going from one to two, it does put some strength on it.","As we feel right with the whole thing is I mean - I guess when I look at FX I probably at it first competitively now an absolute sense and there is a question whole cable industry and this is what reported is dealing with the issue of traditional rating declines. I think FX has held real one when I think actually it\u2019s programming continues to if anything distinguish itself from its basic cable competitors more and more and I love it some of the shows that coming this year, I think they are great. So I think it\u2019s - and I feel very good, I think we feel right about it, I mean really I feel very good. I mean I think we do this, there is going to be some pressures and competitively I think it\u2019s very strong and we\u2019re dealing with the same pressure on ratings that the broader industry is and I think competitively sort of doing well.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks a lot.","Reed Nolte","Thanks you Antony. Operator, next question please.","Operator","From the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thanks. So my two question, two different ones. First one true[X], can you talk a little bit about how you best utilize that business to drive FOX\u2019s advertising [indiscernible]?","And the second question, can we go back to the currency impact, I mean I know you\u2019ve just asked the question on acquisitions but given the strength of the dollar does it change at all your thinking about making acquisitions outside so does it change the way you might think about the buyback give the reset on fiscal \u201916 guidance if there is - impact on stock price, would it make you accelerate, I mean how you are thinking about opportunistically the impact of currency.","James Murdoch","So on - thanks Jessica, it\u2019s James. true[X] okay it\u2019s probably a little early you will see over the coming weeks and months some further kind of developments in terms of the closing of the true[X] transaction and how that and that is in the business. So we are excited about it and really for us it\u2019s about investing and the capability around ad innovation that we can service in the company as it does service multiple clients in the industry but also I mean we have hopefully accelerate the rollout of new technology and some new ad products that we think.","Really at the forefront of thinking around how you monetize digital viewership, how you monetize time shift to viewership. And as we see the steaming share of time shifted viewing continue to grow vis-\u00e0-vis DVRs, really you have to remember that we\u2019re really just in the very, very foot hills in monetizing that viewership and that viewership is very, very larger to material percentage above what our life plus 3 or life plus 7 viewing is. So it\u2019s really about monetizing the streaming environment and being able to accelerate with new ad product for other broadcasters as well as for our self, but there will be more on that going forward.","Fundamentally it\u2019s about the acquisition of capability within networks group and we think - we really think it can done overtime.","John Nallen","And I think on the Jessica, it\u2019s John. I don\u2019t think currency change that all changes our view on how we look at the buyback, we are as Chase indicated, we are scheduled the complete the current buyback again at the end of the year. I don\u2019t think current markets where we are going to change our - add on our velocity is a buyback for the remainder of the year. And we\u2019ll continue to look to invest in ourselves as change refer to and so be opportunistic around opportunities that come up but it\u2019s - there is current plan to change the pace velocity or size of the current authorization.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Okay.","Chase Carey","With respect to your question whether are not currency would change or view on M&A or strong dollar, I mean some of that - so at the end of the day I think we\u2019re always going to be looking at opportunities around the quality of the business and there you know and how they really performing. And the currency overlay about is largely secondary.","John Nallen","Yeah, I think M&A in terms of currency I mean look at the health of the region in the market, I mean probably not currently look at. When you look at Europe, you obviously got up sort of have some degree of concerns about how Europe navigates the short term. I think certainly there is lot of international markets, we feel great about it, I mean Indian the case in point we still lot - I mean the development market broadly very excited about but clearly you got the what\u2019s going on in countries and certainly we\u2019ve encourage the issues we\u2019ve had in this [indiscernible] a reflection of sort of broader economic issues. So I think we\u2019d always take broader economic issues.","Longer term broader economic issues into account in terms of evaluation where we were going to invest. Again though I think most of our investment so on repeated would be in the form of building business is not making large international acquisitions.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Operator, next question please.","Operator","It will come from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield","Hi thanks for taking the question. So just off kind of just a housekeeping question. You know looking at the solidness of your subscriber revenue streams that sort itself in the first half. When you look at the back half of the year give the reduction full year guidance, can you just give us sense like, you talked about the currency but what type of domestic ad market are you looking at for broadcast network stations and cable, could you just give us some color or just it sounds like those number obviously pretty down pretty substantially at least for the broadcasts stations and networks, but just some sense of order of magnitude and will cable also feel that affect versus the strength you have this quarter?","And then just of kind of a big picture question, I don\u2019t know for all you. When you looked at the rational for the Time Warner acquisition attempt over the summer, it seem to us that direct-to-consumer business with all the content the combine companies would have had versus selling your content in Netflix was a huge potential benefit. As you look at kind of what\u2019s going on in advertising and you look at the kind of the strength in Netflix keeps growing, does is make it that much important kid of revisit that transaction workout some form of relationship with, I am wondering just because both of you could both in this ad market and the change in consumer, you both could use each other more than ever before?","Chase Carey","I guess a little color on the first part and so I get the little more color on the second half of that. I mean there is averages common on the ad markets I guess that because inside of that. What is say sort of the ad markets is we look at him today. Nationally I guess they are they are okay, probably not you where we might hope, I think we came into this quarter hoping that be up probably a bit more renewed budgets in the like probably that quarter, feel the - probably like the fourth quarter, like the December quarter, maybe Shine, raise a light to give you a little hope. The national to be a little better but I guess it\u2019s not as robust as we would have hoped in terms of a rebound but it\u2019s okay.","The upfront pricing is still a premium to describe. I mean discounted pricing is bring in to the upfront probably - so it\u2019s okay, I would say the local market are probably softer than the national markets, I think the local markets from a market perspective as we look at what our expectations are for this year, I think the local markets took up.","The market factors had a bigger hit. I guess what I - I guess as you look at sort of what to try a little more visibility to sort of the adjusted guidance I mean really there is sort of probably three buckets in aggregate that are sort changes from when we last look at it then it\u2019s currency, it\u2019s the broadcast business and the content as John touch on and they probably and about equal I mean sort of probably the better part of all these round numbers, better part of 100 million bucks in each. So I think we\u2019ve talked about currency begin 100, I think broadcast and again the content which is a combination of Shine being clearly significant event and then to a lesser extent that releases that didn\u2019t pay now.","In the broadcast piece it\u2019s sort of it\u2019s a prior biggest rating it was, we already talked. In the first quarter, we know already it was short and to a large degree, our content upside offset the ratings shortfalls. Probably ratings are little bit worse but than our expectation in the quarter but that sort of 100 is probably a better rating. Sports as John touched on with a little soft I mean, our two big Conference Championship games will blowout the next the two biggest regular season games I mean John gave the - more clear all the knock panel, the panel was a touch behind and a big four clock games in the last quarter. So that - the 100 is up is a little bit and clearly is up station market and we\u2019re expecting sort of it, and I think we talked about going into the year a lower single - we already expecting much we are sort of expecting a low single digit 1% to 2% market growth and probably looks like now a low to mid decline - no, low to mid decline percentage. You know we do a billion dollars in six months in that business, so if we get 5% swing 50 million bucks.","So if you add the broadcast pieces up and say it\u2019s 50 million bucks in a stations and 25 to 25 in the sports is the biggest begin collage - the collage games. And another piece of ratings on top of what really was largely we anticipated in the September quarter. You know there is sort of I will give you the pieces and the offset we\u2019ve had in content went the other way what Shine being pulled and a couple of spectrum is not being what we thought to be.","Oh Time Warner, we are not - I won\u2019t give my moved on feel but we moved on. We - Time Warner was not a necessity for us and the issue we are facing today we feel excited about. I mean I think we have the what we a breath of a content that enables us to navigate the space, you talked about Netflix, I think from the get go, our approach to the SVOD space Netflix in particular and specifically the SVOD space in general has been to disciplined about it to make sure we participate in that business by hearing to sort of rules that first and foremost defend the value enable us continue to grow our core businesses which is the networks and make sure we are large our overall time and not cannibalizing our core business in an adverse way for the spend to the extent of short terms dollars.","So we have been disciplined in terms of what we do. In reality, our recent SVOD have been actually with the Amazon and Google Plus, so I think that\u2019s a positive that you got more competitive marketplace than you\u2019ve had. But we will and will continue to ensure that we are not going to take actions that in a prioritize short term profits from a sale at the expense of the health of our long terms deficits. You know and I think we\u2019ve been true to that up to date in these things and we will continue to ensure that we grow our overall business and that\u2019s certainly the overall principle will stay true to as we develop the opportunities in the digital platforms.","We think their real opportunities to develop you know ways to offer our product and know what exciting ways and we have to figure out what are the right models, you know for those, we are doing a lot of work on that we are obviously engaging with some third parties, we did announce, we concluded with [indiscernible] we are taking to others. But in all these cases, we\u2019re going to ensure we things that enable us to grow our overall business not cannibalize it and we think we have the - as the franchises and the content that puts us in a leadership position to be must have content with essentially not everybody made somebody can grade a package that doesn\u2019t have content in but I think our content at its core is content that really is central to the video business and we are confident in our ability to navigate that and to a short an exciting future for us.","Reed Nolte","Thanks Rich. Next question please. To go to line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank","Okay, thanks very much. I just had quick follow-up on your last answer Chase. Would the buckets being sort of equal contribution from content FX and broadcasting, would the relationship sort of be the same for fiscal \u201916 as well as fiscal \u201915 like kind of equal contribution to the head and original guidance?","Second question is do you guys watch the interesting new initiatives with some partners for local readings kind of being in the Dallas market, I think it\u2019s the new coin rating service. Can you talk about that - that effort why you launched it and what your ambitions for it are? Thanks very much.","Chase Carey","Yeah. I mean I think on - let me guess on first on \u201916 I say that I think we talked about currency number next being another approximately 200 million hit. Clearly the broadcast business goes forward of a base that we - that we\u2019ll - 2015 we\u2019ll provide a base to go forward, so in many ways that carries through and probably we\u2019re a little bit - look I think in the broadcast business where we are is a little behind, we\u2019re behind that, we\u2019re few years behind the curve we expected to be on.","I think we believe the values we talked about, the broadcasted business will be there but we\u2019re not - we\u2019re not in the growth, in the point the growth where we expect to be on. As we said, we\u2019re probably investing a bit more in sort of focusing on stabilizing the business next year as opposed to prioritizing growing profit.","So yeah, that is - so certainly the broadcast business will carry through. The one that I say in the film - film issues were really one time, I mean Shine. We expected Shine to be out, a year ago we didn\u2019t but certainly when we talked about this year, we expected Shine to be out in \u201816 and the films are always - they\u2019re onetime events, so there\u2019s nothing - there\u2019s nothing recurring about the content piece.","And on the new ratings, look it\u2019s all yeah we think - I\u2019m going to make that measurement issue a scapegoat for all the issues. So I think there\u2019s a valid issue, I don\u2019t think - I don\u2019t think we\u2019re happy with the measurement tools that exist out there that strictly gets all this viewership can use to move in different places and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to try and get a more accurate and - accurate and improved way, I mean ability to measure viewership and so we\u2019re going to continue that pursuit, any opportunity to present us the ability to do it and there is well with Neilson and certainly we\u2019ll continue to work with them but clearly we think there are issues in terms of the accuracy measurement. And the ability of our current measurement tool to keep up with really where the viewership\u2019s going. I mean it is quarterly moving to places that really aren\u2019t being, aren\u2019t being captured and adequately measured today, so I think we have to be proactive without trying to find solutions.","David Bank","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thanks David. Next question please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you. I think my question is for James. James, now and then we hear this argument from investor that there is an oversupply of content out there because of both for scripted, entertainment and sports as a result of networks producing more COD services and so on. So clearly as a company you don\u2019t believe that, so I wonder if you can tell us what you think is - the flow is in this over supply argument and if you think it\u2019s even ever possible for it to be - to happen in one of the categories? Thank you.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much for and then I\u2019ll let Chase to take one of the answer as well but it\u2019s - yeah, look I think there\u2019s no question that there\u2019s such an absolutely enormous amount of original production going on right now. I think it\u2019s less driven by the SVOD services is driven by cable network programmers getting into dramatic series production by and large and increasing volumes and the numbers are still going up.","But I think it\u2019s really important to remember that one hour scripted television is very, very different from another hour of scripted television. So the total volume isn\u2019t really the question, the right question is what\u2019re you making, how do you make it great, how do you stand out and can you be a place that can attract the great show runners, the great riders, the great talent to come and do incredible work and I think we\u2019re very, very confident that creatively the teams across 20% Trifox companies can continue to execute. They\u2019ve been executing very well but it\u2019s not really a question of a volume here, it\u2019s a question of how do you make stuff that\u2019s genuinely distinctive in that environment where you have so much consumer choice.","And I think the thing that exacerbates the competitive kind of dynamic around it is that with the availability of streaming platforms and the availability of vast libraries of scripted programming, you\u2019re really competing with not just what\u2019s on in the same hour but you\u2019re competing with everything that\u2019s come before. And that\u2019s something that is a great creative challenge but one that we feel is our core business to try to ride through and to try to get great people to do that.","Chase Carey","Yeah, I mean guess and I think all I guess simplistically is what that\u2019s not certainly an oversupply of its hit programming and that\u2019s - that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, it may be all is right but. Realistically there is an oversupply media for programming but it\u2019s evolved and I think the real question is who is positioned and there\u2019s a ton of product out there so it\u2019s kind of competition, who\u2019s positioned to the best position to create the hit programming tomorrow and who has the access and the breadth and the relationships and the scale. I think there\u2019ll be winners and losers, I think the business you see today will not be what the business looks like in a few years and I do think there\u2019ll be winners and losers and I think it\u2019s a question of who\u2019re going to be the winners, who\u2019re those that were positioned to have the best opportunity and the best position to create the hits of tomorrow and we think we\u2019re in a great place, so yeah I - and that\u2019s our goal.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thanks Vasily. Next question please, operator.","Operator","That comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","Alright, thanks. At this point let me try and keep it very short and sweet. Could you just tell us for your fully distributed U.S. domestic cable networks, would you say that total subscribers year-over-year are flat up or down and in your long range plans, what is your anticipation or expectation for the basic trend of that, basically total full line multichannel pay-TV subscribers? That\u2019s it, thanks.","Chase Carey","I said they\u2019re down a touch, I mean and they\u2019re not even 51% its but it\u2019s sort of - the down cuts and that pretty much is, it\u2019s pretty much in line with our expectations. I mean I\u2019ve used the phrase franks, I use it again and we think whether it\u2019s a combination of winding also the economic pressures at the margins that we\u2019ve expected it and I think right now what we\u2019re saying is pretty much in line with our expectations.","Reed Nolte","Thanks, Todd. Next question please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","Different questions, first of all how would you characterize the relationship between the broadcast network and the stations at this point just in general?","And then second any interest or conversation with the SEC with regards to the incentive action that we still don\u2019t know if it will go off in \u201816 but what it does. Thank you.","Chase Carey","When you say broadcast network station did you mean our third party affiliates or do you mean everyone else?","Marci Ryvicker","No it\u2019s third party affiliates.","Chase Carey","Okay, it\u2019s like it\u2019s a good relationship. We\u2019re obviously navigating new times and certainly we\u2019re committed to working with them. We value the relationship with the affiliates, we value the business model with them, there\u2019s no question in a world of - in a dual revenue world where we believe our programming is what drives the subscription side of it. We\u2019re navigating new arenas to create the terms of commerce for us between them. And so I think not surprisingly there\u2019s - some of those get to be - conversations with some friction in them, but we\u2019ve had a good and healthy relationship and I think our goal is to - which we\u2019ve been able to do, I mean really most of our affiliates they\u2019ve continued to find out - to work with and continue to and our goal is to - they need to find ways to work with them.","So I think we\u2019re - anytime you\u2019re sort of navigating new business models and that\u2019s been really in many ways what we\u2019re doing with them. I think there\u2019ll be some corrections as you work through it but our goal is to find something, our goal is to find a fair solution. We think our programming is valuable, we think it deserves to be - we deserve compensation for that programming and I recognized farers in the eyes of the holder but that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking and expecting to get. It\u2019s fair compensation for our programming and that\u2019s our goal is to better work that out with them. What was the second question?","James Murdoch","SEC","Chase Carey","The SEC is one - the incentive auctions, look I mean I think it\u2019s fairly something we\u2019re taking seriously we\u2019re engaged in and give them some of the numbers to get to - some of the numbers to get through out around certainly pretty interesting. If you look at the auction it is just concluded and it\u2019s certainly probably adds to that and so we don\u2019t know enough, there\u2019s stuff to still - stuff to be flushed out, but certainly we\u2019re fully engaged, we\u2019ve got a big station group and in reality two big station groups if you include MyNet as a group. So we\u2019ve got a lot of stations and a lot of lot of spectrum, so I think we certainly fully, want to understand more with the opportunity there. There is certainly a number of signs, it could be interesting.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","The next question please.","Operator","That come from the line of That come from the line of John Janedis - Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Thanks. Just one please. Chase I think the growth at the domestic cable networks is not worthy in the backdrop of the broaden, you guys discussed around the ad market. And let me look into your next call, the markets going to be taking about the upfront, so with the viewing of content moving to multiple platforms and the revenue impact related to the measurement issues, do you have a view on the potential to de-emphasis the upfront process or maybe information given the backdrop the market is also changing?","Chase Carey","No, I don\u2019t think I mean, certainly I am sitting here , I cannot projects about the upfront but I don\u2019t think sort of four months away from now you\u2019ve been - you are going to have dramatically different approach that we have but we are currently taking how we are approaching the ad market, I mean it\u2019s like touched on, we have restructures our entire ad sales organization at a many ways. The primary reason for doing that was to position us to deal with the world forward. I mean the Western calls that came out but the objective that\u2019s the secondary consideration through those were just deficiency most. Our objective in reorganizing or restructuring the ad sales organization was to position us to deal with the world - the world we expect we can be in which again as viewership moving up license and advertisers not surprisingly what is the - wanting a lot of attribute of efficiency and effectiveness like come with additional platforms.","We have to make sure we are positioned to take to manage, that\u2019s all I think that\u2019s a priority and I not sure in terms of what we doing it starting today not even the upfront, so the upfront is part of that process, but certainly the way we are approaching that impress the entire ad market is in a state of transition.","I will say an additional well a lot of money is clear and life desire, I think one thing we hope to do and I think our concept because it\u2019s so important it can help is it\u2019s still unclear to what degree our advertise getting value out of the digital marketplace, in many ways they maybe what is R&D spending which probably has a logic to it. But you can see clearly in many place are they getting value for that\u2019s better they chasing they are sort of goals in terms of attributes so that knowing whether they are getting the value for it. So I think only hope we add a dimension that sort of enables them to ensure about having content that really I think it\u2019s a sweet spot that we are able to really deliver on the value that gets associate with those digital platforms.","Reed Nolte","Thanks John. Next question please operator.","Operator","Comes from [indiscernible] with FBR Capital Market. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the dividend in the context of your comment earlier that you are over capitalize position, you it\u2019s bright and encouraging to see the 20% hike in the recurring dividend. I was wondering if you could talk about what drove the analysis that got you there and as you look at your capitalize position, what are you feelings about maybe using more that for dividend either recurring or special.","Chase Carey","I mean it\u2019s like I said we - it is a topic the board is engaged broadly, you know it\u2019s buyback dividends I don\u2019t want to get too apart of the board in terms talking about plans or initiatives. I think what I really faced is just generally we have been clear we think reach on a capital to shareholder is an important part of our overall philosophy and the dividend - we look at our business, we\u2019ve had confidence in our business and we think it\u2019s appropriate and we certainly thought this move is appropriate and I think we\u2019ll discuss further what\u2019s the balance between buy backs and dividends and overall speed of that - with which we return the capital through those various vehicles.","But I think it is something we\u2019re committed to and again we will certainly have board meeting next week and certainly we\u2019ll continue to discuss where we should be and it\u2019s a process we take seriously.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, fine, thank you.","Reed Nolte","Operator it\u2019s certainly one minute so we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. Just a question on the broadcast network and in you earlier commented that reinvesting and helping to stabilize the broadcast business. I guess if you can give us some color of how constrained you are in terms of inventory perspective would make us take advantage of maybe some improvement in demand down the road. How far out it is but there is - make a - even not - the inventory how much flexibility you have in them?","Chase Carey","Actually in the broadcast business we don\u2019t really have make any issue in it. Again we probably don\u2019t have - probably what affects is we don\u2019t quite have the - the inventory we might have this for the scatter market, we are in the scatter market but from a makeup perspective we don\u2019t really have anything that would be out of the ordinary course for us - want to make good. We have opportunity as the years goes along through various vehicles and events at times that drives, obviously we\u2019re short in our ratings, so they\u2019re not we expected, so we have to deal with that but we\u2019re pretty good in dealing with that on an ongoing basis not letting it stock file and that\u2019s certainly true to date where we are.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you, very much.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Alexia.

The Company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and the reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.","Lachlan K. Murdoch","Thanks Reed, good afternoon everyone. Over the past few quarter's earnings calls, we've talked about the strength of both existing and emerging distribution platforms. In this quarter, we've seen some positive tangible results of the work we've been doing in this area, which all of us here are pretty excited about. In a few minutes James will take through our thinking and the early milestones we've achieved. But first, I'll briefly address the highlights of a good quarter for us.","We continue to be focused on building powerful brands, making compelling content and driving advertising innovations, all of which create meaningful long-term value for stockholders. This past quarter's results financials and operational demonstrates good progress against these objectives. The quarter itself reflected underlying strength led by double-digit EBITDA growth at the cable businesses, the second highest quarterly EBITDA ever at the Film Studio and further programming momentum at the network at our international cable channels.","Affiliate revenues grew by 7% in the quarter across our global television business and by 10% excluding currency impacts, this growth is supported by our investment across our entertainment news and sports brand. Fox Broadcast Network has a number one broadcast series with Empire, the number one news series with X-files and the number one scripted special with [indiscernible].","Fox News network at ranked all a basic cable for the first time on the strength of prime time rating, they were up 35% in the quarter. FX continue to define high quality culture defining storytelling, the People versus O.J. Simpson, American Crime Story, is Cable\u2019s most watched new primetime series and Baskets is Cable\u2019s most watched new primetime scripted comedy and Nat Geo earned its highest rating ever with its recent docu series Story of God with Morgan Freeman.","Add revenues grew 4% in the quarter. This trend was fueled in part by 20% plus increase in domestic scatter pricing and also reflects the particularly strong Fox News viewership and Stars continued solid gains. The market has recognize the power of premium programming to win the attention of consumers, while the value of our broad reach for brand market is clear we continue to move towards a more efficient and effective targeted model that has enabled by streaming distribution.","At Filmed Entertainment the company delivered the highest grossing R-rated film of all time the Deadpool, which has earned more than $760 million in global Box Office receipts against a modest production budget. It is also the highest grossing film ever for a first time director Tim Miller a distinction we are equally proud of. Looking ahead, we have the highly anticipated theatrical release of X-Men, Apocalypse and of Independence Day Resurgence in our fourth quarter and Ice Age 5 in July. In although it\u2019s a ways off we have also announce the James Cameron is well underway developing four Avatar Sequels.","At our television production business, we produce three of the top four broadcast series of the current season Empire, X-Files and Modern Family and a number one new comedy Life in Pieces, sorry the number one new comedy Life in Pieces. In addition, we produce the absolutely fantastic The People versus Simpson, American Crime story. Looking forward, the studio has three new Fox Series and development as well as 15 broadcast pilots [owe] (Ph) them for Fox.","And it is clear that in a world where more people are accessing more screens across multiple technologies and platforms, the demand for such premium content will continue to grow. It's why we are excited to be offering our portfolio brands to new consumer driven platforms like Hulu and Sling and its why we believe we are well positioned at this dynamic time in our industry.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John P. Nallen","Thanks, Lachlan and good afternoon everyone. You will have seen in today's earnings release that we reported very strong financial results in the quarter underpinned by a 12% increase in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter revenues increased 6% over the prior year and growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments was partially offset by a slight decline at our Filmed segment. Absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, third quarter revenues increased to 9% over the last year.","Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.88 billion, a 12% increase over a year ago reflecting double digit growth at our Film and Cable Network segments and slightly lower results at the Television segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the quarters EBITDA growth rate by 7 percentage points. From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $844 million or $0.44 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.47 this year up 12% versus a comparable $0.42 a year ago.","Looking forward with the first three quarters of the fiscal now behind us and based on all assumptions inherent net current outlook, we are comfortable with the fiscal 2016 EBITDA guidance that we provided to you on our last earnings call. Specifically flat to low single-digit percentage growth above the $6.49 billion and we reported for fiscal 2015 excluding the BBS business.","Now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the third quarter staring with the Cable Network segments. Overall, total Cable segment revenues increased 10% and EBITDA grew 12% excluding an approximate $60 million negative impact from currency rates EBITDA grew 16% in the quarter. Note that this year's results included the consolidation of the National Geographic non-channels businesses that were acquired in our second quarter, which increased both revenues and expenses in the segment by approximately $90 million.","Domestic revenues increased 11% in total, with affiliate fees up 7% and advertising up 17%. As expected our domestic affiliate revenue growth decelerated slightly in the quarter primarily reflecting the timing of affiliate contract renewals. Our expectation is that affiliate fee growth will step up as we begun the next calendar year consistent with the time table for upcoming contract renewals.","Domestic advertising growth was led by higher ratings at Fox News the continued strength of local sports the RSNs as well as the consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting a strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher political coverage at Fox News an increased content and marketing spend at FX driven by two new original series lead by the People versus O.J. Simpson.","At our international cable channels reported affiliate and advertising revenues both grew 6% versus last year, but on a local currency like-to-like basis affiliate revenue increased 20% and advertising revenue were up around 9% driven by strong growth as Star Entertainment channels and at the Fox Networks international channels. Reported international channel EBITDA increased 67%over the prior year even after reflecting to $60 million negative foreign currency effect. This EBITDA growth reflects a higher revenues as well as lower sports right costs at Star due to the absence of last year's broadcast of the ICC Cricket World Cup.","Turning to our Television segment, third quarter EBITDA was $125 million, $16 million lower than a year ago. Total revenues increased 5%, led by higher retransmission consent revenues and higher political advertising revenues at the stations. This revenue gain was absorbed by increased sport program in costs, principally for NASCAR and NFL in the quarter.","At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA increased $88 million versus last year, higher contributions from the Film Studio reflecting the successful theatrical release of Deadpool were partially offset by reduced TV production earnings, primarily from lower contributions from Glee, which had its final network season last year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted the segments EBITDA this quarter by approximately $50 million.","And finally regarding capital allocation from July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $4.2 billion worth of Fox A shares of which approximately $3.7 billion has been against our $5 billion buyback authorization.","With that, I'll turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Welcome everyone. So as you have seen it with a solid quarter, now there is a lot we will talk about and hopefully we can cover a lot of ground in Q&A. But I wanted to first highlight some of the objectives of the business well broadly and the progress we're making towards them and in particular, we talk a little bit about our digital business and plans.","Over the long-term but approaching quickly, our all entertainment will be consumed over IP streaming networks that means that what we create and produce is released into an incredibly competitive environment in which the customer can choose at any minute in any device, any entertainment that has ever been made. So first in foremost, we need to be making better things all the times. We're immensely proud of the creative achievement to the business recently and the momentum that we have at each of our brands. We're in a better place in almost all of our businesses creatively.","This is driven by the investments we've made in our brands over the last number of years. We're positioning for success in this environment, where it's now worth making a distinction between linear and digital anymore, just as the walls between cable and broadcast melted away years ago. We're building a business that has real scale, in streaming distribution and monetization capability. At here too we've made a lot of progress, we're very focused on the velocity we need to be add and even with some progress depending heavily on counterparties, these last three quarters have seen a marked step up in pace.","Last month we announced our participation in Sling\u2019s, new multi stream digital video service with all of our entertainment and sports brands forming a core part of a new all digital product, priced well below the fully bundled MVPD offering that some customers find hard to digest. In this week, we can confirmed as well that we're working with Hulu to participate in a reimagined digital video service later this year that combines the current and live affiliate distribution model with an expensive and attractive SVOD window.","We think this breaking down of licensing windows into a simpler and more straight forward set of rules is going to be very attractive for customers and therefore for downstream video retailers as well. We want to make our programming more available not less and we wanted to be able to innovate in the way we can monetize that programming on digital platforms. This precedential move with Hulu means we can now licensed similar consumer services and products to new entrants or establish MVPDs, encouraging and enabling innovations downstream, creating a distribution infrastructure that allows us to monetize more effectively and all the while grow our direct to consumer capability.","Our work on this front has not been limited to the U.S. In India Star's groundbreaking Hotstar mobile video product, recently crossed 60 million downloads and just launched a premium subscription tier, leveraging our exclusive writes for HBO Originals, films and the Fox's library and over the next few months this service will also include a premium sports offering. In Europe, Sky Go and Now TV at our 40% owned affiliates Sky continue to go strongly and the launch of Sky Q is off to a strong start. And in Latin America, Fox Plus our premium digital on demand service is growing well and is now available to over four million subscribers.","This progress we're making put us on a strong footing and as we look across our global portfolio, we feel good about where we are and that we have the right strategies, assets and brands to see significant opportunities both in mature and developing markets. The next decade is one of really immense opportunity for all of us at 21 CF and we're very focused on seizing it.","So with that, we're happy to take your questions.","Reed Nolte","Ryan, can we go to Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield","Thanks for taking the question. During O.J and the American, I noticed, I think, everyone has probably noticed a real increase in the push that you are driving of FX now and I'm curious are you seeing a real pick up in users anyway you can qualify or quantify actually. How many people are using FX now on an authenticated basis? Have you seeing a dramatic change and time spent.","And then just James you brought up the commentary about Hulu, which Mike Hopkins has actually talked about during your upfront this morning. Well curious how do you think about what's going to happen as you compete with legacy distributors, is it simply just the time is right to take matters into your own hands and kind of lead your path forward regardless of whether it ruffles feathers of the Comcast and the charters of the world?","James Murdoch","Thanks Rich for your question. Look on the first one, I don\u2019t want to get into a specific numbers on FX now usage. But one thing that we are very focused on is growing consumption on our kind of we call our owned and operated apps, the Fox Now, FX now and Fox Sports and we\u2019re seeing good growth there and you are right we have been marketing that more on our air, because we think it's a really good consumer experience.","We think it's a great way for customers to access the programming, it's available to many, many million of MVPD customers on an authenticated basis and it\u2019s something that as you've seen as we've restructured and created our digital - direct to consumer group, it's something that we\u2019re we are just very focused on building. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do to grow the audience in the streaming environment where we can innovate and monetize better in terms of data and analytics, in terms of how we create new add products and monetize them, the pricing we are achieving there.","And that's true as well with Hulu, where pricing on Hulu from an advertising perspective is very, very attractive for us and we think that's a mix between Hulu our owned and operated apps as well as the VOD platforms belonging to the existing MVPDs where we're seeing really market growth marked growth. And I will say that what we're seeing decline in terms of multi-platform usage is really in DDRs and as streaming availability comes forward and is much, much better and creates a better customer experience DDR usage seems to be declining or is declining on a percentage basis pretty dramatically.","And that's something that is A, good and B, it\u2019s something that we want to encourage. But we need to make great products available for customers and make sure that we are putting together good product and working closely with our MVPD partners in terms of making sure the authentication pathways are as smooth and easy as possible, which as we all know there is a lot of work to be done to improve that and improve that part of the user experience.","And your second question with respect to that Hulu and the competitive response, look I think our view is that we would like to make our programming more available not less. We would like to our brands and the customer experience around our brands to new entrants in the downstream distribution market be they over-the-top or new products and services developed by the MVPDs. And that's just as I mentioned in the remarks earlier and offended new licensing to Sling for example under the core part of their new multi stream digital video service or licensing to Hulu as it develops its plans for this next generation video service for customers across the country.","And I think really the strategy for us is to create these products with simpler windows things like better in-series stacks, better customer experience and make that available to MVPDs generally so it's not really a question of some heightened competitive dynamic, it's always been a competitive environment downstream. And just as licensing to satellite and Telco's was seen a controversial at the time, we think these new entrants paying a fair price putting together a great products for customers is one that\u2019s actually going to spur growth in the overall universe of video customers. But also is one that\u2019s going to make a better user experience driven by those competitive dynamics and we are very keen to play a part in that and be a catalyst for making that happen.","John P. Nallen","And we will install the same rights on the same terms through the existing our MVPDs as well.","James Murdoch","Yes. Exactly.","Richard Greenfield","Just a follow-up on that walk lane. So will you be able to - the same distributors will be able to create the same types of skinny bundle that you are going to create with Hulu.","John P. Nallen","We've referred a column of our core bundle, as appose to a skinny bundle because it\u2019s really the core brands with Dolby represented in the bundle, but yes Rich you will.","Richard Greenfield","Thank, very much. That was a great follow-up.","Reed Nolte","Operator, could we have the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, let me keep on the Hulu questions. Can we talk bit about right and in seasons stacking one of the challenges have been in the past couple of years is that as a network you have not bought all the right and then as a studio you may not have sold those rights. So could you give us a sense of how you are thinking that evolving on in season stacking. Is that the way you expect for Fox and FX to controls own and would you sell in season stacking rights of the networks like [Indiscernible] so talk about rights for a second.","Lachlan K. Murdoch","Look I think there is - our preference would be to - if you want to think about establishing sort of standards at least for us anyway is that we would have full in season stacks available to customers. We think that the best customer experience, we think it's sensible and I think there has been a little bit of - its taken a little while for the industry if you will to settle on how to price that, I mean how do you think about those things. I think that's getting more established now.","So yes we we\u2019re very focused on having full season stacks for current seasons and then having a more seamless sort of hand off between that and the later SVOD Windows. So simplifying those rights in those windows is something that we are focused on really in an effort to eliminate what our - can appear to customers as really arbitrate hold backs driven by business rules that they don\u2019t care about and our focus is on how do you make a better customer experience. We think in season stack is a key part of that","Michael Nathanson","Last one would be on [international] affiliates, one of the frustrations also is some of these packages cant role internationally, because we don't have affiliates on board. So talk about the process of being able to offer all the affiliates maybe Hulu or Sling, how is that going to evolve?","Lachlan K. Murdoch","Those things you know the affiliate agreements, the affiliates tariff agreement on a national basis is something that Hulu and the affiliates are sort of involved in. We would anticipate that we would be able to achieve substantially national coverage pretty soon for all this things. I mean it\u2019s kind of necessary, but each affiliate group and each agreement is different and that's something that - in the Hulu's case they have to have with those affiliates in Sling\u2019s the same.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Reed Nolte","Thank you Michael. Ryan, could we have the next question please.","Operator","That comes from a line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi thank you. Sorry to sort of stay on the same topic here but James, I mean just to clarify from your earlier comments, in this evolving kind of anywhere, anytime model that you talked about more demand, potentially better pricing, but potentially risk to linear model in terms of that revenue stream. Is this the net positive for Fox? Or is it sort of determined depending on how successful you are, I would love your thoughts on that. And should we assume that when you are doing these deals like with the [indiscernible] and Sling, you are getting a premium pricing to what you would get more of the traditional model.","James Murdoch","I think we've talked about it before Alexia. Thanks for question. We talked about a little bit before, I think if we can establish the right sort of licensing arrangements, the streaming distribution model is actually much better model. You have to take into account as well, our ability to monetize advertising in a different way, we believe that there pricing on a streaming and streaming advertising base can be much, much better than network pricing. Given our ability to target, our ability to have lower ad loads, our ability to put new kinds of ad products like engagements units and so forth into the marketplace.","So we think from an advertising perspective, it can be a superior business and from an affiliate income perspective, we're obviously very focused on getting a fair price for each of our brands and all of our brands in aggregate so that the streaming distribution business is a net positive as you put it for our overall set of brands.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just in terms of pricing, is it a [indiscernible] that you get better pricing on these new entrants on these over these top products or is it sort of every contract is different?","James Murdoch","I think, we take all of our distribution agreements, so if you look at them in a round that overtime we can achieve price increases et cetera, but certainly these agreements are in line with what the current market is for these brands to be distributed in the current season to customers.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","John P. Nallen","Yes net-net economically to us, we'll be from an affiliation point of view, we'll be agnostic in terms of whether customers in MVPD customer or the MPPD customer.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","James Murdoch","Yes.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Alexia. Rryan next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Well two questions. One is just a wrap up of what everybody has been asking, so just to go through the skinny bundle components, pricing on affiliate fees, it sounds like will be at least the same so no loss there. Advertising monetization should be better, is there any other revenue driver that we should be thinking about and I think James you said that all the brands link on Sling and Hulu, I just want to clarify when you say all the brands, do you mean including the RSNs all of the Fox Channels?","James Murdoch","I think on the Sling package has been outlined out there and it's all of our brands but Fox News had in earlier deals with [indiscernible], so that's not included at this point. The Hulu agreements, Hulu arrangement is for all of the brand including the RSNs and the Sling includes RSNs as well. Look we think the RSNs are a huge driver here, I think sports in the screening environment can be enormously attractive and priced attractively to customers.","I think it obviously drives the big audience in the liner and live viewing, but we look around the world not just here and see sports really driving over-the-top consumption as well. So I think that the sport feature is really attractive and it\u2019s something that's very fresh and new in over-the-top environment with these new products.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Okay and then just to may be probably change that question. So as we are approaching the up-front market, I would love to get your thoughts, but also how different will this be in terms of component, I mean you are clearly going down the path of more targeting, more platform, selling across platform, selling more holistically. Could you just give us your thoughts on kind of what is ahead in the next few months?","James Murdoch","Well first of all, on the up-fronts generally, we're really excited about the up-fronts, we think that all of the networks are in really good shape creatively. And as Lachlan mentioned in his comments, scatter pricing has been really strong, it's been a strong market so it's really great moment to go right into up-fronts and we're very excited about that.","I think also your point about the changing components of how we sell advertising, we're really focused here on how do we sell a total audience, and how do we really market to our advertising partners to other brands to the attention of that audience. I think we are driving incredible engagements in our audience both in linear as well as in digital platforms and we want to add that up and really creates something that\u2019s very valuable for those advertisers.","It is a more complicated process right now just because we have varying measurement techniques and we have to really add all of that up and have a more broad conversation with advertisers, but it\u2019s one that they've been extremely focused on and excited about. So I think the engagement with all the big brands we work with has been strong and I think in up-fronts you will see a bigger component of digital obviously and sticking together all of this multi platform audience to create one platform for video consumption that makes sense for people.","I think that's going to be a trend that's going to continue. But ultimately, we have to think of it less as the sort of sliced and diced different commercial windows and more about a total audience across all of these platforms, which sometimes its current programming, sometimes it's a month old programming and we continue to add cumulative audience and engagement overtime and raise that. It\u2019s really exciting in terms of the overall audience growth and overall inventory growth.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Ryan, could we have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Hi thank you and maybe a bit more of a follow-up James. Back to the ad market, you talked about the strength and I think it's well appreciated that the traditional TV ad markets has been tight for a variety of reasons including ratings. So with the younger viewers watching less live TV and given your comments, I guess some response to Alexia and Jessica how more receptive or advertisers to buying VOD and DAI as an alternative relative to six to four-months ago. Again to your point, just to trying to thinking about alternative ways to increase inventory and monetize shows that don\u2019t include shortening the length of the actual program,","James Murdoch","I think qualitatively I would say buyers are much more engaged around buying that multi platform audience. And that's been a progression, because that's really where a lot of the audience is. So when we look at total ratings being down in any given - for any given network X-percent actually the total multi platform audience is holding steady to up, when we put it together. So I think we are moving away from saying okay look let's get people to go from plus three to plus seven and we are really talking about total audience plus 30 plus 60 whatever.","As I said, I think on these call before, all viewers are alive, so all of the viewing should be counted as live viewing and its a question of establishing the currency that people can buy easily and get their head around and that's a negotiation that you have. But certainly there is an appetite to really follow where the viewers and where the engagement is and that is multi platform and it is across a longer period of time.","John Janedis","Is that more so you think a calendar 2017 event or is it beyond that or are we much closer to meeting later this year?","James Murdoch","Well I think we are going to see continued growth through this year and I think in 2017 as well. I think it\u2019s as a component part of our total viewing the multiplatform viewing outside of the live window or the liner window I should say, continues to grow, we expect that to continue into substantially all other than in our sports to news business, which we\u2019re adding a streaming and ad targeting capability with the new platform. But obviously in sports to news the vast majority of the viewing is actually live.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you John. Ryan, could we have next question please.","Operator","And that comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Star India. Fiscal 2016 was a year when investment there and I think you invested additional sports right on some over-the-top applications I was wondering if you could give us an update on how that went and should we expect to see a benefit into fiscal 2017?","James Murdoch","So thanks Vasily. first So of all, yes we have been investing as you all know in the Indian business, but the sports investment in particular and in the digital investment with Hotstar and we will continue to do so. That said, the peak investment year is really behind us and actually this fiscal year in 2016 you will see it will have been strong growth for Star overall over the last year and we expect that to continue.","We\u2019re extremely pleased with how the sports investments is going particularly with Kabaddi and Cricket the two kind of biggest there. Kabaddi is a new sport that's growing very well, we will be investing in expanding that season and growing that sport, but also on monetization of Cricket rights is actually getting much, much stronger as well for a variety of reason.","So I think we are happy with how that investment has gone and in the Hotstar side and digital it's 60 million plus downloads of the app and increasing consumption of pretty substantial length. These aren\u2019t really short film videos people are watching soaps, they are watching dramas, they are watching sports and we think it's a very, very exciting new platform for us.","So we are pleased with the investment and how it's gone and going forward. We are very confident that the growth in terms of EBITDA from the Star business will be in line with the target that we've laid out in the past, which is getting towards the $0.5 billion of EBITDA within a few years in 2018 and towards a $1 billion were on the end of the decade.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you","Reed Nolte","Thank you Vasily. Ryan, could we have next question please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","[indiscernible] like just a couple of quick one on affiliate piece if I may, these are very mundane question. If somebody be willing to just walk us through a bridge of domestic cable affiliate fees from the growth rate from last quarter down to the growth rate this quarter. I think the two main elements we have about are the [Yes blackout] (ph) and whatever is going on with core cutting and shaping, just wanted to confirm that.","On a related note, when we think about pricing is back to over-the-top bundles. With your traditional distributors grown accustom to these annual rate increases per sub, so you've been questioned already on what the starting price is for your networks with these new services. I would like to extend that question and see should we expect annual rate increases with those type of distributors as well or not. Thanks.","John P. Nallen","Todd this is John, I'll take the first part. So yes you are right, there is deceleration from Q2 to Q3 and as I said, we expect the step-ups to occurring in the beginning of calendar year because of the timing and that's really what happened in Q3 as against Q2, we anniversaried a number of step-ups in Q2, so we enjoyed that lift and that benefit leading to the 10% growth and now that pattern is more comparable year-on-year in Q3.","James Murdoch","And I think what we'll see in terms of affiliate fee growth going forward is an acceleration in 2017 and 2018 as new affiliate agreements come up and we're able to do that and then with respect to sort of pricing for new entrants. Now we go back to looking at whenever we seen new entrants come into the marketplace, we see a increased competition and we think that really increases the value of programming upstream not only do we continue to invest in that programming and make it better for customers. But also the value of that increases the more competition we have at the downstream retail level.","So we're very confident that we're going to continue to be able to grow the value of our programming in these brands, in a downstream retail environment that's more competitive not less, more innovative not less and that's a real shift. So what we would really like to see, I think, everyone would like to see, where we think these new entrants can be catalyst for and hopefully there will be more of them is growth in the total video consumption universe downstream as well as into the broadband only household as well as replacement products for some customers. But also continued pricing strength as that competition increases.","Ultimately, it's up to us to make products that are distinctive, that are great, that customers really care about and that's why we you know are so focused on these brands that we've been investing in and simplifying our investment around to make things that ultimately matter for customers. That matters for our distributors and we think we can get a fair price with that approach.","Reed Nolte","Thank you Todd. Ryan, could we have the next question please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you so much. I think James, Lachlan how could I not continue to ask about Hulu. I mean one of the great debates I think we're going to continue to have with these virtual MVPDs will be optimizing subscriptions in customer experience versus the desire that generate advertising revenue. And you touched on the potential for lower ad loads. Has you experience with Sling or any of your surveys or studies given you a sense of what the right ad load is going to be for these virtual MVPDs. And if you were ad load on VOD online for streaming ends up quite a bit lower where we see you, will we see your live ad loads harmonize with that over time?","James Murdoch","I think I wouldn't say today that I wouldn't be able to predict today, what the ideal ad load is two years from now, three years from now, four years from now. We would say the experience that we have is that A, the advertising loads are highly relevant to the customer experience, there is no question about that.","There's no question in that we invest a lot in programming and we invest a lot in kind of achieving a suspension of disbelief amongst our customers as we create the cinematic kind of experiences for them. And then we had jerk them out of that environment to show them advertising. That's obviously necessary economically in many cases.","but I would say that's biggest lesson we've learned is interesting with the Hulu ad free option, where customers can opt in to pay a premiums to buy out essentially their own time to buy their own engagement. Many have chosen to do so, but certainly not all of them. So customers are smart and they understand the value equation here.","So we think some will pay a premium in that environment to have no ad load, some will value the lower ad load that exists on Hulu today for example than in the broadcast environment. And I think in a streaming environment, the real opportunity here, is to have better pricing and more targeting across the piece, which allows us to continue to reduce the ad load as more video shifts and more consumption shifts to the IP streaming platform.","Doug Mitchelson","And increased CPM at the same time","James Murdoch","Yes and increase pricing.","Doug Mitchelson","And I think the debate will obviously continue with part of the thought is if you create this new business model and let\u2019s call it new and it ends up with worse economics to start because ad loads are lower and it can take a while to grow the CPMs to where you want them to be or perhaps just because you presume younger customers furlough ad loads, they won\u2019t come into the product without that. But you build a sustainable business that can grow from there. Is it worth it to take that step down in economics initially, hoping that ultimately you can either grow that business from subscriptions or targeted CPM as that make sense?","James Murdoch","Yes, look I mean we're doing that today with what we're doing in terms of encouraging usage. The question earlier, was around FX Now, we certainly don\u2019t fully monetize all of that streaming viewing today, but we're totally convinced that it's a better ad experience for customers and better ad experience for advertisers and it can be a better business than the traditional broadcast ad load business. So we do that today and I think it's too early to call how big that investment is, but fundamentally we do believe in a long-term of this business, we invest against a long-term of this business and establishing these streaming platform at scale is absolutely worth it.","Doug Mitchelson","And we've been running a lower ad load and Empire for instance and we do that on a show-by-show - on a series-by-series basis, and make those judgments every day, either worth building the value of those series in those brands and obviously in many cases that absolutely is.","Reed Nolte","Thank you Dough. Ryan, could we have the next question please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Omar Sheikh","Hi there, quick couple of questions. First of all on a Hulu again. James I wondered if you could just outline what you think the market opportunity is for this new product and where do you think - what does your research tell you about what sort of customers you are going to get. Is it going to be another complimentary product and just to get you added to new subscribers you expect on the existing Hulu subscription product, kind of what sort of numbers the subscribers might should be we thinking about over the next few years. That's the first question. And secondly, I want ask about Star India, there are some sports rights deals that are coming off in the a couple of years, I think IPL rights coming up in 2018. I wonder whether you could just give us your sort of current thoughts on what you think Star might need in terms of incremental sports rights over the next couple of years? Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks Omar. Look it's really going to be for Hulu to comment on their customer numbers and expectations specifically, so I won't really get into that but I would say that when we look at the proliferation of new MVPDs new virtual MVPDs or the existing MVPDs innovating. creating new over-the-top products and improving their own product experience. I think the opportunity is very large and one that is very much worth pursuing and very much worth trying to be a catalyst to create, but I think the specific subscriber goals et cetera better less to those distributors.","With respect to India, I don\u2019t think were really focused at this point on incremental rights, but in all of our sports businesses, not just Indian we always seek a balance and we have to see when new rights come available. How do they fit, how can they would be monetized or other rights things that you would give up to pay for those and you have to create a balance of investment there that you think is delivering the right value for customers and the right value for the distributor.","So I certainly don\u2019t think given the performance of the business, there is any necessity you have incremental rights on top of where we are today, but from time-to-time we may invest in new rights and let other rights go or find ways to monetize new rights, so that it's not necessarily an incremental investment. But we love the sports business, the cricket business is strong as I mentioned earlier, from a monetization point of view it's very strong right now for Star and it's a sport that we\u2019re obviously very committed to.","Omar Sheikh","Thanks. Alright just a follow-up could I just ask on Star. Do you think the total sports cost to Star have peaked?","James Murdoch","The total sports investments for us in terms of the investment losses in establishing the sports business have peaked, whether or not the total cost base of sports over the long-term that's a really question of what is the size of revenue as well. So I think I would say that the investment losses that in creating the sports business has peaked and we\u2019re seeing the business move towards profitability.","Omar Sheikh","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Reed Nolte","Thank you Omar. Ryan, could we have the next question please.","Operator","Comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Salmon","Hey good afternoon everyone. James, maybe could we return to Hotstar for a little moment for a better for worse you probably focused as a little bit less on the OTT options overseas and I'm just curious about where your bigger picture ambitions are for it particularly with differentiation versus some of the other over-the-top products there. That seem to be a little bit more driven by TV shows and films and you talked a little bit more about brining sports there and also maybe how Netflix\u2019s entrance into the market affects the competitive dynamics for it?","James Murdoch","Well first of all I think the Hotstar business - it's an exciting business because it's really broad based, so we already do include sports in the Hotstar business, but not live, it's on a delayed basis. So the premium sports often would be coming later this year and we think it's going to be attractive. But the peaks in usage come not just from sports, but also from the availability of new scripted series as well. So as you are seeing pretty broad based usage across that and something that\u2019s pretty encouraging and reasonably long session times.","The key issue in India around that over-the-top services mobile video in particular is really to tariff structure you know and media to tariff pay in terms of data from the Telco. So a lot of the consumption is bigger on Wi-Fi when people are at home or an internet caf\u00e9 et cetera and until we can get - until you get larger data caps or flat pricing et cetera. I think that's going to continue to be a dynamic and that does put a constraint on pricing that's why the core business in Hotstar is free is just its just so many people can download and use, because it becomes quite expensive given the data tariffs.","And then with respect to the premium subscription service that we just launched, I think it is more square in competitive dynamic with the Netflix which just launched their et cetera, which you can view that we wanted to have at attractive price for people, so it's price underneath where some of the other competitors are. But with some of the best premium international television in the world for example from HBO, from FX, from places like that. so it's a really attractive service, but it's too early to comment on what scale it's going to be, what we think the growth is, we really just launched it a few weeks ago, so it's the premium server. So that's where that is. Was there another part of your question I don\u2019t think so okay. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay and that comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft","Hi good afternoon. I was hoping to ask two question if I could. First, how are you handling the technology side of the digital streaming business both from a platform and network aspect as well as the advertising insertion. And then separately when you talk about a core bundle of networks for Hulu, and there are companies like yourselves and on major broadcasting cable networks with very few of the mid-size and smaller networks."," But you have got other companies that have similar major network assets, but at the same time have more of a long tale of mid-size and smaller networks. How do you reach agreements with those companies without having to load to basic tier up with more channels than you want and also how do we think about the smaller cable network groups. Thank you","James Murdoch","Thanks. Well on that last seasoning, really that's a question for the distributors right, so it\u2019s a question for Hulu, it's a question for Sling, et cetera. And those are things that they have to deal with it, then they are coming to agreements with these things. Yes we are investor in Hulu and we are early licensee I guess and so we can talk about our position around that.","But as you said, we've spent a lot of time over the last couple of years simplifying that's brand portfolio, getting into places where we have five big brands that really matter for customers and we're going to stay focused on that. The other piece of that is really for Hulu or Sling or any of the downstream retailers. And what was the first point of your question, sorry.","Bryan Kraft","How are you handling the technology side of the streaming business?","James Murdoch","Oh yes sorry. Well I mean again there is a lot of be it a Sling or Hulu or the traditional MVPDs, obviously that's for them to do, our real focus here is how does the user interface work for us in terms of our owned and operated apps, what are the things we have to interface with their systems. But we're not in the business of direct streaming ourselves that much, but we work in particular on the authenticated apps very closely with the managed network, the facilities with distributors to try to figure out how the best customer experience could be there.","But it's not again, I think that's really a question for the video platforms be it Hulu or Sling or any of those guys and how they do it. We've restructured some of our own organizations but more focused on investing in this technology and customer experience and approximately development, we consolidated that into one group, we've really stacked up during that in some of the best product people from around our business and affiliates into that. And it's something that\u2019s you will see we will progress on from product perspective over the next six, nine, 12-months and continually thereafter.","Bryan Kraft","And TrueX the primary technology provider for the advertising insertion?","James Murdoch","For the advertising yes, and it's really now formed a core part of what we call our advanced advertising group which really does all of the tech ops and everything around that advertising for our digital and linear across the piece. So we have one place there to managed all of that inventory, price it properly and develop new products.","Bryan Kraft","And then my last follow-up, I promise, do you think that you are going to move to more of programmatic approach to selling advertising, as you move to more of dynamic ad insertion streamed world?","James Murdoch","I think programmatic is a really big word, it means a lot of different things to a lot of people, is mostly the buying and selling and advertising from just inventory management and pricing point of view going to be done by machines in the future, yes. But that's not a comment on pricing, that's a simple question around efficiency and process.","Bryan Kraft","Great. Thank you James.","Reed Nolte","Thank you Bryan. At this point we are out of time. Thank you everybody for joining today's call. And if you have any questions, please give Mike Petrie or me a call. Thanks.","Lachlan K. Murdoch","Thanks, everyone.","James Murdoch","Thank you.","Operator","Okay ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's call.

Welcome to the Twenty-First Century Fox second quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.","Reed Nolte","Thanks very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen; our Chief Financial Officer.","Fist, we\u2019ll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially what is said. The company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2016 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of, and reconciliation, of such measures can be found in our earnings release and in our 10-Q filing.","Please note that certain financial measures used on this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And lastly, please note that our offering for Sky plc that was announced last December is governed by the UK Takeover Code and as a result we are subject to strict limitations as to what we can say with respect to that transaction.","And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks, Reed. And good afternoon, everyone, from Houston where last night we were privileged to witness a brilliant Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at Fox Sports. I want to thank the literally thousands of Fox Sports staff who brought us this amazing game.","This single game is a great example of the strength of live sport, increasingly delivered across multiple platforms, the power of our core brands aligned with our ability to cross promote them, and the continued value broadcast television delivers to the world's leading marketers.","And yesterday, the Super Bowl powered Fox's first $0.5 billion revenue day, and that's something that\u2019s made Mr. Nallen, sitting across from me, very happy.","Of course, that revenue falls in the third quarter. But for the second quarter, we are pleased to have delivered another strong result, both from an operational and financial standpoint as evidenced by the 15% EBITDA growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth that we have just reported. Importantly, this growth was broad-based with earnings gains in all of our operating segments, including strong double-digit increases in both film and television.","Core to our overarching long-term strategy is our steady focus on building the value of our video brands. That means partnering with the best creators and investing in the highest quality storytelling, the best journalism and premium sports rights to ensure our video experiences are vital for any consumer offering, established or emerging. murdered ","Testament to the progress we have made is our ability to again buck the broader industry trend of multichannel subscriber declines. In fact, this last quarter, we grew our cumulative domestic subscribers by 1.5% over last year's level on the back of subscriber additions including FXX, the FOX Business network, the National Geographic Channels, and Fox Sports 1.","Our momentum underscores the strength of our brands across categories and genres, be it sports, news or entertainment, both scripted and non-scripted. The investments we've made to bolster our leadership in these areas are paying dividends.","We\u2019ve been saying this for a while, but actions and outcomes speak louder than words. Clear and demonstrable evidence of the value we\u2019ve built is the meaningful affiliate renewals we recently achieved for our RSNs and Fox News with one of the nation's largest MSOs. We completed an agreement at the end of December, which delivered on the objectives we sought out.","As part of the deal, this MSO will receive TV [indiscernible] rights across our entire RSN portfolio for the first time, a huge benefit to their subscribers and our passionate viewers.","In addition, our full suite of brands was included in DirecTV Now\u2019s November launch and we expect the full suite to be included in a wave of emerging DMVPD to services, including, as previously announced, Hulu\u2019s live and on-demand service which launches in the next couple of months. These agreements with both established distributors and new entrants move us forward on another strategic priority, driving a more compelling user experience for our customers.","This is one of the key strategic pillars behind the agreement we announced in December to acquire the 61% of Sky we do not already own. A combination of our two companies will give us leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and technologies, while enhancing our sports and entertainment scale.","The Sky transaction will also deliver more balanced revenue streams and geographic spread. It further simplifies our structure and operating model. And in terms of the financial rationale, it is significantly accretive to our core earnings per share and our free cash flow.","As the founding shareholder of Sky, we are proud to have participated in its growth and development. Its transformation over the past 25 years into Europe\u2019s leading entertainment business has been extraordinary. We believe this transaction is the highest and most effective use of our capital to deliver shareholder value and returns over the long term.","Now, before I hand it over to John for a financial review, I want to conclude with some brief marks on our cable news business. On our last call, I noted the strength of Fox News. That strength has continued unabated. Fox News finished 2016 as the most-watched cable network and achieved its highest rated year in history. Post-election, Fox News is continuing to beat CNN and MSNBC combined.","Adding to this strength is year-over-year growth in the import 7 PM and 9 PM time slots, following recent programming changes. All of this underscores the underlying strength of the Fox News brand, the enduring power of its positioning and the continued loyalty of its viewers.","With that, I\u2019d like to hand over to John for his financial review.","John Nallen","Thanks, Lachlan. And good afternoon. Today, we reported another good quarter of financial results, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of our business segments, with particular strength reported at the television and film segments.","Second quarter revenues increased $307 million or 4% to $7.68 billion, led by growth at both the local cable network and television segments, partially offset by slightly lower revenues reported in the films segment.","Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.99 billion, a record for any quarter, and a 15% increase from the prior year, reflecting double-digit growth at our television and film segments and continued good growth at our cable segment. This quarter's results include a $44 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency rates. And absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate was 18%.","From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $857 million or $0.46 per share. Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments at Sky and Endemol Shine Group, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53, which is a 20% increase over the comparable $0.44 reported a year ago.","So, with that, I\u2019ll provide some additional comments on the performance of our operating segments for the second quarter, starting the Cable Networks segment where EBITDA of $1.33 billion was up 6% on revenue growth of 7%. Total Cable Network expense growth was 8%, which includes a 2 percentage point increase from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners.","Domestic cable revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by advertising increases of 12% and affiliate fee growth of 7%. Ad revenues continued to benefit from the rating strength at Fox News as well as strong ratings and pricing growth at FS 1, driven by Major League Baseball post-season, and from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners, which added 2 percentage points to the ad growth. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued growth at our expanding networks.","EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 12% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset by increased Major League Baseball costs at FS 1 and NBA costs at the RSNs and higher expenses from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners and the launch of our new programming initiative across the Nat Geo channels worldwide.","Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 2%, driven by a 5% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 12% on a local currency basis. Advertising revenues declined 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis versus the prior year. This primarily reflects an approximate $30 million decline at STAR\u2019s entertainment channels due principally to the negative impact from the demonetization policy implemented in India in early November, which meaningfully lowered overall market advertising spend.","The market expects this dampening effect and disruption from the demonetization to substantially abate within another month or so as new Indian fiscal years commence.","Reported international EBITDA contributions decreased 13%, primarily due to the lower advertising revenues at STAR and a 9% impact from negative foreign exchange movements.","At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $376 million, a 35% over last year, driven by increased revenues. We had strong advertising growth from a very successful broadcast of the World Series, which benefited from two additional games and viewership levels not seen in two decades and higher political advertising at the station. We also had continued double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth. And additionally, the stations generated incremental revenues from permitting the use of some spectrum in one of our markets.","These total revenue gains were partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming expenses at the network as well as higher promotion costs from the launch of new series.","At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA of $389 million was $87 million higher than last year. This increase was primarily driven by lower marketing costs in the current year due to fewer theatrical releases versus last year.","Additionally, revenues in the quarter were 4% lower than the prior year primarily due to the difficult comparison against last year's worldwide theatrical performance of the The Martian.","It\u2019s worth noting that while we reported very strong fiscal year-to-date earnings in this segment, the comparisons become much more challenging in the second half of the fiscal year. In the next two quarters, for example, we will be comping against last year's very successful releases of Deadpool in theatrical and The Martian in home entertainment.","Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter, we purchased $132 million of FOXA shares, leaving our outstanding authorization at roughly $3.1 billion. And also in the quarter, we issued $850 million of new debt and repaid $400 million in maturities.","And, now, let me turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks, John. And thanks, Lachlan. So, as you\u2019ve heard and seen, the first half of the fiscal year has been a good one and the outlook for the next few quarters and years is also encouraging.","Now, as noted, it seems an opportune time to talk a little bit about US sports. It was a key driver in the quarter and its emblematic of our broader strategy around big brands and making investments in the programming that matters the most for our customers.","The MLB post-season was strong. The seventh game of the World Series was the most-watched baseball game in a quarter-century, while the National League divisional series was the highest-rated week in FS 1\u2019s history. Both drove strong ad revenues in the quarter, while strengthening the overall franchise.","Now, the NFL post-season was also strong. Average viewers per game exceeded 40 million in the playoffs. While we did see single-digit audience declines for our regular season NFL games on Fox, I want to note that our national games still average close to 20 million viewers. And yesterday, it looks like Super Bowl LI had more than 170 million total viewers.","So, the power of sports can't be overstated. In the US, 88 of the top 100 most viewed telecasts on television last year were live sports. And across all of our broadcasts, Fox Sports continued to deliver what we believe is a superior experience to viewers in terms of production, talent and technology, and we\u2019re very proud of what the team is doing.","We\u2019re also continuing to make great progress in entertainment. From Taboo, Legion, Fargo, Atlanta, Baskets, Archer and the Americans at FX to Star, 24, The Mick and Empire at Fox; Genius, Mars and The Story of God at National Geographic; Gomorrah, Babylon Berlin, Fortitude, and The Young Pope at our affiliate Sky, and Malleswari, Dil Hai Hindustani and Neeli at STAR, creatively, the business is firing on all cylinders and at a high volume and velocity.","This year, across the group, we\u2019ll produce almost 500 original series, over 20,000 hours of entertainment programs.","I'd like to touch on where all this puts us and on the future and the direction of 21CF and the potential to create what we believe is really incredible value here. We\u2019ve spoken with all of you many times over the last few years about simplifying our business, focusing on core brands and creative output that matters and taking the many steps required to get there.","In December, with the announcement of our intention to acquire the balance of Sky and wholly consolidate that asset finally into the group, we took a major step, at least as far as intent, in a long process that started a number of years ago. We\u2019ve shed non-core assets, consolidated joint ventures, invested in our core operations, created new capability sets within the group and simplified our management structure. All of this has been part of executing a core realignment of the company around the future of video.","The underlying revolution, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end user connected displays, and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video platforms. We believe this is only just the beginning and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform business is precisely the combination of strengths that we\u2019re developing.","In short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build a platform that is an expression of those underlying trends presents one of the most promising opportunities for our company in decades. And so far, we've made great strides to this end.","A few quick data points. The Hotstar platform in India, barely two years old, continues to grow quickly. In December of 2015, we saw about 16.5 million monthly active users. In this last December, that number was over 50 million. In terms of engagement, minutes of viewing in the December quarter grew year-on-year from 3.9 billion minutes of watch time to 17 billion minutes.","Across Europe, the Sky has delivered online and over-the-top services to over 13 million customers and streamed in the December quarter almost 20 billion minutes.","And in the US, within the next few months, we will be rolling out a major overhaul of our streaming apps, which will deliver a step change for customers and future customers in quality, in discovery and in engagement.","The streaming business is not limited, of course, to our own platforms. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, our investment in our core brands has meant that our portfolio is very desirable to existing and new entrants alike, as demonstrated by our licensing last year to DirecTV Now, Sling, Hulu\u2019s soon-to-launch streaming MVPD and Google's upcoming service.","We expect this explosion of competition to benefit customers, to spur innovation, and grow the overall marketplace for video in the US where topline subscriber trends have been previously not so great. That should reverse over the coming years.","We\u2019re at the beginning of a great transformation of the business and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.","So, with that, I\u2019ll turn back over to Reed and we\u2019re happy to take whatever questions you might have.","Reed Nolte","Now, operator, we\u2019d be happy to take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to stay on the topic of the bundle, particularly in the US market, with two questions. John \u2013 or actually, I think Lachlan mentioned, subscribers grew year-on-year, which is certainly encouraging. I think affiliate revenue growth decelerated from last quarter year-on-year. So, if there's any color around noise in those numbers that could help explain that, that would be helpful.","And then for anyone who wants to take it, we're all focused on these new streaming packages coming out, and at least I would argue that Sling and DirecTV Now have had some technology challenges in terms of scaling. And I'm curious how focused Twenty-First Century Fox is on that topic as it relates to Hulu, in particular, where you're an owner. How confident are you that product is going to come out of the gate and be robust from a product offering scalability perspective? And should your shareholders be expecting that when that comes out over the next couple of months? Thank you.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks, Ben. I\u2019ll deal with the first part of the question and James can take the second part. The affiliation revenue growth did decline very slightly in this quarter, but still, obviously, positive. And we would expect, as we\u2019ve maintained for a while, the new affiliation agreement start to take effect. We\u2019ll see that growth accelerate again towards the second half of the year.","John Nallen","I would just add, Ben, we\u2019re only a few million dollars away from rounding this 8% from the 7%. So, there\u2019s not a lot of noise inside of it.","James Murdoch","And, Ben, thanks for your question. I think the short answer is that the team at Hulu and certainly what we\u2019re doing as well with our streaming apps, everyone is very, very focused on how do you solve some of the challenges in streaming, particularly when you have a lot of concurrent streams. So, I think we\u2019ve seen really, really good progress in terms of our ability to stream concurrent streams of live sports, of the high-volume entertainment programming, for example, at the Hotstar platform that I mentioned to you earlier, as well as what our affiliate Sky kind of routinely does with Sky Go and NOW TV. And Hulu is working very hard on making sure that that experience for customers is as good as it possibly can be.","You never rule out teething problems and I think it\u2019s instructive \u2013 or it\u2019s worthwhile kind of just mentioning that some of these problems in streaming, particularly concurrent live events when everyone\u2019s logging in at the same second, it\u2019s non-trivial. That said, we have a high degree of confidence in the Hulu platform, in the team there, their ability to deliver really a ton of minutes of streaming across their subscriber base currently. So, we think it's going to pretty strong. I think some of the things you've seen over the last number of months are normal for new services and certainly we expect those kind of kinks to be worked out. But, certainly, it\u2019s not an easy technical challenge, but it\u2019s one that is surmountable and the team at Hulu is very, very focused on it. And I think the experience is going to be pretty good.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Ben. Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator"," Yes. And we go to Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael Morris","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Couple of questions. First on Hulu, can you talk about your expectation that the NBC Universal channels will be included in the streaming MVPD service? And it seems to reflect maybe in the near term a lack of support from one of the major Hulu partners for the product. Do you think that's the case? And does that impact sort of what can be done with that product?","And then second, just on the Sky brand, it's a powerful brand in Europe, clearly. Do you see any opportunity that that brand could actually be brought to the US and used in any way on any of your products? Thanks. ","James Murdoch","Thanks, Mike. Look, on Hulu, the matter of Hulu\u2019s negotiations with third-party providers and content owners is really for Hulu and one that they engage in and we don\u2019t. That said, I know that the team there is very focused on putting together a package of programs and brands that are going to really work for the customers and they\u2019ll make those decisions as that commercial negotiation kind of plays itself out. But I think the product is going to be pretty good.","And, look, you\u2019d never sort of \u2013 you don\u2019t want to really engage in a lot of speculation about the future of the Sky business, et cetera. I think when you look at this business across the board, our focus on these brands and the Fox brands broadly, on National Geographic, on the STAR brand and on Sky brand in their regions with different levels of strength has been one that we intend to continue. And if there\u2019s opportunities to grow those brands, as we did with the Star brand, launching services to the South Asian diaspora across Europe and in particular the UK a number of years ago with great success, these things can live in different territories. But there are no plans at this point. Right now, we\u2019re focused on the strength of all of these brands and growing all of these businesses as best we can within their kind of immediate neighborhoods to be honest.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Yes. And we go to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. First question for James, this is about capital allocation. So, pro forma Sky, the balance sheet will be a touch above 4 times levered. Does this \u2013 do you think \u2013 hold you back in any way, either in terms of the buyback or in terms of strategic M&A? And more specifically, with the new administration and FCC regime, if the FCC regulations were relaxed to allow you to own more TV stations, the question would be, would you have the inclination to look at acquiring TV stations that could come available?","And the second question is for John and it\u2019s about Cable Network profitability. So, last summer, you announced an incremental $200 million in investment, in programming in Nat Geo and FX, you now lapped the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners. The question is, when might you expect Cable Network segment margins to return to expansion? Or said another way, when you look at the programming investments in Nat Geo and FX, when do those start to taper off, such that the programming expense growth moderates? Thanks a lot.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Anthony. Look, I think with respect to capital allocation, looking at the balance sheet going forward, I think the key thing to remember about the Sky transaction that we kind of detailed in December was the rapid deleveraging profile of the combined business. So, yes, we sort of land at around 4 times, a little bit above. It really de-levers rapidly. And we\u2019re going to be focused on deleveraging, right? So, we\u2019re going to put that at the top of the agenda for the number of kind of quarters and years post-closing. So, I think it kind of de-levers pretty quickly and I think we have capacity to do other things, either think about additional capital returns by way of buybacks and continuing, obviously, with a growing dividend. Or a potential kind of medium-size or bolt-on M&A where we think capabilities and kind of expanding our business can make sense. But at this point, we\u2019re really focused on the shape of the business as we\u2019ve outlined to you. And as you can see and we\u2019ve shown you, I think the deleveraging profile there is pretty rapid and is pretty manageable for us. So, no, we don't think it really curtails us and this is the most sensible thing as Lachlan laid out in his early comments. We really think this is the best use of our capital at this point with the highest returns available to all shareholders, given the accretive nature of it and the pace of deleveraging.","And with respect to \u2013 potentially the FTC relaxing ownership caps on terrestrial TV stations in the US, no, I guess is the most straightforward way to answer the question. I hate to comment on future sort of speculation and hypotheticals, but I can \u2013 I think you can rest easy there. We really like the shape of our station business right now. And there always may be affiliation swaps or other little bits and pieces around the edges. No, we don't have a big appetite for adding much to that.","And then \u2013 I think it was three questions. John, do you want talk about programming expense.","John Nallen","Anthony, on the expense trajectory, so this year was a step up for Nat Geo and FX. Actually on a relative basis more for Nat Geo with products like Mars and Genius and everything else. So they\u2019ve begun the ramp-up of what we call the 2.0 strategy. We\u2019ll see a bit of it continuing into next year, but today was \u2013 this year, sorry, was the real ramp-up for Nat Geo. FX continues its trajectory toward its full schedule. We probably won\u2019t fully get there in the current year, but given the product and the success of what FX has done and particularly the success of its product, not only on FX, but on other markets, that's an investment that the returns are just fabulous on.","Lachlan Murdoch","I think you can already look at Taboo which premiered three or four weeks ago which is the first part of that extra programming expense, and it\u2019s been a terrific success doing that, and we\u2019re very happy.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Anthony.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks very much.","Reed Nolte","Operator, next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thanks. I have a couple of questions. First, James, you talked a little bit about next generation apps. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 give us some color how will you approach advertising within the apps?","Second, as good as the numbers were this quarter, the outlook seems better. Comcast talked a little about their programming cost increases for the next four quarters. Can you give us any visibility on what the affiliate fee, domestic affiliate fee growth will look like, and how quickly \u2013 on India, how quickly will you recover from the demonetization impact? And are there any other drivers that we should look for in the second half?","James Murdoch","Okay. Thanks, Jessica. In terms of advertising in the sort of apps, I think one thing that\u2019s really interesting is that as we revamp and you'll see over the next kind of month-and-change, we\u2019ll start rolling out on a per platform basis, tvOS and then Android and so on as you kind of roll through the kind of estate out there. The authenticated apps really have a potential to reach an enormous audience. That 90 million or so MVPD households out there, under our agreements, have access to these apps. And what we need to do is ease and simplify the authentication pathways. We need single logins across multiple brands. We need to really make it easy and a great experience for customers. And we think we can generate some real audience there. Now, that said, what\u2019s exciting about that is that that\u2019s a platform for us to innovate in terms of advertising. So, that's around dynamic ad insertion, it\u2019s pricing a customer\u2019s time in a different way, it\u2019s about engagement units and other things, really lowering the ad loads and getting a higher yield. We\u2019re already seeing non-linear advertising growth at a very, very good clip in the US and internationally, and that's because, from a data perspective and then a monetization perspective flowing from that, with innovative new ad products and different loads, you\u2019re going to have a much better experience. So, we\u2019re going to approach it, first of all, by making sure the app platform is stable. It\u2019s not easy dealing with the number of systems, the number of MVPDs, all the different authentication kind of issues that are out there. But, first of all, we want to make it stable, we want to make it a great experience. We\u2019re very focused on having a very, very big \u2013 large volume of content available on those apps. And we\u2019re going to kind of iterate in terms of how the advertising monetization works. It's already going pretty well with the existing apps and we think we\u2019re going to able to enhance that experience and enhance our capabilities over the next number of months and through the rest of the year. It will be a big focus for us.","Lachlan Murdoch","This is Lachlan on the affiliate fee growth. I sort of answered the question a little bit before, Jessica, which was just on \u2013 with the renewal that we signed at the end of December and then with some new renewals that start rolling in March, we expect affiliate fee growth to accelerate at really the end of the fiscal year. So, you can read in that the fourth quarter, almost see the acceleration begin again.","James Murdoch","And it was, obviously, a little bit slower. We\u2019ve talked about earlier just because of the anniversaries of deals. We just didn\u2019t have any renewals at the right time. It\u2019s just the natural kind of cycle of it.","And then, with respect to the impact in India, look, the demonetization, obviously, was a big impact in the quarter. We continue to feel some of that. It\u2019s ameliorated over the last month and we expect that to kind of wash out of the system. But you will see that impacting this current quarter that we\u2019re in and we have to really see what the fourth quarter looks like.","I just want to reiterate that the business is performing pretty strongly. The impact is primarily associated with the entertainment advertising piece of this due to the nature of our clients and the nature of their business and how it\u2019s impacted by the demonetization. Viewing share is very strong and we\u2019re very confident that the business, once it\u2019s through this kind of speedbump over a quarter or two, will be able to get back on the trajectory towards the targets that we\u2019ve outlined for 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","I have two for James. James, question for you on Hulu is, since this idea first came up about a year ago, there's been a large list of new entrants to the space. You mentioned many of them, including Google. So, as an owner of Hulu, where do you now see the opportunity to take share in what's becoming a pretty crowded marketplace? ","James Murdoch","Well, first of all, I think it's crowded in terms of the number of sort of names that are out there, but I don't think \u2013 I think it\u2019s very, very nascent. We\u2019ve seen Sling, obviously, first out the gate. I guess Sony views Sling to actually be very recent and we expect the team at Hulu to be ready for a launch pretty soon. And we think there is a lot to play for. We think it\u2019s a big opportunity.","I think, for us, I guess, and we\u2019ve been sort of talking about this for a while, we think that that proliferation of downstream competition is really, really healthy for content creators and for brands like ours that robust, that are differentiated, that can really deliver content that works for customers. So, we think that that, A, from a 21CF perspective, that proliferation is going to be a positive thing for our business and we do believe that it can reverse some of these overall declines in subscriber trends in the total MVPD universe and have that go forward.","And then, with Hulu, in particular, as you saw, I think Mike Hopkins did a great job kind of unveiling a lot of the details of the service, of the planned service, at CES earlier this year. I think that live viewing plus current plus the past seasons and movies, by really bundling the SVOD services with originals and library and past seasons in with what is the kind of current MVPD window I think is a very compelling offering that makes it simple for customers, that makes it exciting, and I think gives it a real unique, at this point, angle on the marketplace. So, we think it could be very exciting. I think it's \u2013 I would just say, it is very early days. So, even though we've seen a lot of announcements and we\u2019re seeing reasonable growth in these digital MVPDs. They are just starting from very little over zero. And it's a big marketplace and one that I think is going to benefit from a lot of this innovation.","Lachlan Murdoch","I think, James, just to add to that and I think it\u2019s important for people to remember, Hulu will be part of our [indiscernible] ecosystem of these new DMVPDs. But one of the reasons Hulu is embarking on this strategy is also to influence that ecosystem and what the core bundle. So, while we expect it to be very successful in its own right. It\u2019s already been successful in terms of having some influence in terms of how these packages of core channels are being put together.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Michael. Operator, quick, next question please.","Operator","And we go to Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield","Hi. A couple of questions. In the US, you've got your Hulu product that you've talked about, and what's coming with the virtual MVPD for Hulu. But just wondering, given what you're talking about out in terms of the technology that you're going to be fully consolidating with Sky, with things like NOW TV, is there a path for Fox to build, I guess for lack of a better word, a direct Fox to consumer relationship rather than everything going through Hulu? And what could that look like?","And then, secondly, when you think about Hulu, it's an amazing product at $8. And I think James, I know I've heard you speak at conferences about how when you launched the $12 product, it's actually driven home to people the value of the $8 product, and really shown people the value of watching ads. How do you prevent the launch of a $40-ish product from showing people how much value there is to not watching live, essentially highlighting how great the $8 is versus the $40? How do you protect against that? ","James Murdoch","Okay. Thanks, Rich. So, look, I think, first of all, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re really focused on the streaming customer experience in the platform that we can deliver streaming content on to enable us to have the capabilities. We talked earlier about advertising. We talked discovery of content, engagement generally. I gave you some numbers in my opening comments around how some of that is working around the world in terms of those levels of engagement. But I think the goal for us is first to, as I said, really create this product, a direct streaming product for customers available to many, many, many millions of households on an authenticated basis who are already paying for the programming and we can really enhance their experience with that programming and we can also really enhance our capability in terms of monetizing that, in addition advertising lighter loads et cetera.","But, certainly, it's also an option for us in the future whether or not we\u2019d like to have it independently priced access to that suite of apps, and that\u2019s a decision that we haven't yet made, but one certainly that we feel we have the capability and the general wherewithal and experience in terms of managing direct-to-consumer businesses and subscriber businesses to tackle. But, right now, we\u2019re very focused with our MVPD partners and our new digital MVPD partners to making a customer experience that is as good as it can be, and those decisions around independently priced D-to-C platforms in the US is something that can wait. I would note that between the Hotstar platform, both the free one and the premium tier there and then the businesses at our affiliate Sky and the Tata Sky in India as well, many tens of millions of customers are on this vast direct to consumer platform today that is generating a lot of engagement and a lot of \u2013 a lot of growth and a lot of profit. So, we feel really good about that around the world as well. And whether or not there\u2019s a future for us in that, for example, the way that a CBS has taken some steps in those areas in the US is a decision that we can take at a later date.","And then, with respect to pricing, look, I think pricing and packaging around these things is a challenging sort of art, if you will. There\u2019s a bit of science, but there\u2019s also a bit of art. And the question is how do you make those \u2013 how do you make the differentiation between those tiers really worthwhile for people if they want to step up and do something that\u2019s little bit more expensive. And you try to create steps for them, both up and down, so it doesn't just become in or out of a service. Certainly, we did that and have done that for years at the Sky. And I think the team at Hulu are approaching it in a pretty smart way. A lot of it has to do with just how they\u2019re planning the product in the future. So, I think you have to watch it carefully and you have to create packaging around that that makes it understandable for customers exactly what they're getting, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s straightforward and then they can choose the prices that they like.","And I would say that \u2013 I think that the live programming, current and live sports, et cetera are hugely valuable. And we see that in the uptake and penetration of the MVPD world today and in the engagement numbers and audiences that we\u2019re delivering either to our sports businesses at the RSNs or at broadcast network, as we talked earlier, and with the kind of recency and immediacy of new programming as it launches. So, I think that does have value for people. But detailed pricing and packaging going forward for Hulu is a matter for them that they're going to, I think, be articulating probably pretty soon and then also probably developing it and changing it as it goes along.","Richard Greenfield","That\u2019s incredibly helpful.","Reed Nolte","We have time for about one more question. Thanks, Rich. Operator?","Operator","Yes. So, we go to Steve Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Steve Cahall","Yes, thank you. Just a couple from me. Maybe first, just to continue the affiliate fee discussion, I was wondering, you've given a lot of detail. Can you remind us what percentage of the base of subs you've put on new deals in the last 18 to 24 months and what percentage you have coming up? And maybe if you could share the same for what you've got on retrans on the broadcast side of deals.","Also then, also on cash, just wondering, you haven't talked a lot about working capital lately, what should our expectations be for working capital this year and can you give us any indication of how much cash you might have on the balance sheet when you get to the end of the calendar year?","James Murdoch","I don\u2019t have that number just on the top of my head. It\u2019s about 20% in terms of the sort of affiliate universe. And we actually don't have going forward a lot of lumpiness. We try to space that out, so that every year, few quarters or so, we can step up here and there. We\u2019ve got actually not a lot in the next few quarters. Having done this recent deal, we\u2019ve got a small one coming up and then it picks up again in 2018.","John Nallen","And, Steve, from a cash perspective, we\u2019re a first half\/second half company. So, the first half usually is not our biggest cash flow period, so we\u2019ll have a very strong cash flow period in the second half of the fiscal year including collecting all of the $500 million that Lachlan referred to earlier from the Super Bowl yesterday, while all the payments for that programming had been made in the first half of the year. So, it's quite a healthy and will be substantially growing position of cash before we get to the end of the year.","Steve Cahall","Is it fair to assume you'll be very selective in any stock repurchase between now and then? ","John Nallen","I think it\u2019s probably fair to assume that we view the best use of our capital now to be pointed toward the Sky acquisition, just providing a better return than, as we said before, the status quo which would have included buyback. So, I think directionally that's the way you should look at it.","A - Reed Nolte","At this point, thank you everybody for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions, please give me or Mike Petrie.","James Murdoch","Thank you.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. ","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, Ryan. Hello everyone and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to 21st Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2015, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements.

Murdoch","Thanks Reed, good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. After my remarks I\u2019ll turn the call over to John and James and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Despite some near-term challenges, more specifically due to foreign exchange and disappointing results at our film division we are making good progress on our objectives across the group. The core growth strategies that will move our business forward over the long-term building powerful brands that offer great value to our customers, delivering great story telling, must have news and sports, and innovating in advertising and packaging are delivering real results for the business. ","Domestic affiliate revenues increased strongly in the quarter. This predictable revenue underpins our financial position. Even in an environment with an increasing number of viewing options, our affiliate revenues continued to grow. This underscores the strong demand for and the value of our brands. Developing these brands has been a key strategic priority for us. We believe the work we have done and the investments we have made render our portfolio indispensible for any broad consumer offerings whether established or emerging. The expansion of our national geographic partnership is an important milestone in the execution of this strategy. ","Our overall domestic multichannel subscribers continued to grow increasing in aggregate by 1% over the prior year quarter. This despite the fact that the average fully distributed channel in the MVPD Universe lost around 2% of their subscribers over the same period. And we are seeing strong momentum in high growth international markets like at Star in India where we continue to expand our customer base and our offerings. ","While foreign currency headwinds are creating short-term issues, they reflect the size and scale of our international businesses which are increasing well positioned. The strength of our global brands is of course a direct result of our success in creating unique and compelling creative content. Our distinction in this area was recognized last month with eight Golden Globe Awards across our Film and Television businesses more than any of our peers. 21st Century Fox Film not only led the industry with Golden Globe wins but currently dominates the competition for this year\u2019s Academy Awards with a total of 30 nominations, double our nearest competitor. ","But success in the content production business can be tough to deliver consistently and this year we have seen mixed results at our Film Studio. Financial results from the Martian were strong but they were more than offset by less than anticipated results from several of our other releases. While our film business is running behind our financial expectations we feel good about our releases moving forward. The Revenant and Kung Fu Panda 3 are currently performing well. Deadpool and Eddie the Eagle are slated for later this quarter and X-Men Apocalypse and ID 4 Resurgence for the fourth quarter. ","At our television production business there is also good momentum. We are producing 36 scripted series this forecast season including 20 returning and 16 new series. Many of the new shows are supporting the turnaround of the Fox Network, including the X-Files which tuned audience of over 21 million people surpassing the original series most watched season ever. Globally the X-Files reached an impressive audience of more than 50 million viewers across our international network of Fox owned channels. ","Developing and producing our own shows which in turn drive enhanced ratings on our owned platforms is a priority for us. Just this last week, one of our productions, the People versus OJ Simpson premiered to the highest ratings ever on FX. That is an all the key demos and in total people. What I've just described is at the core of our long term value that we drive for our shareholders. Namely our ability to create, own and monetize hit content that powers our global brands.","Overall we are pleased with the momentum at the majority of our businesses. Our focus on building powerful brands, creating compelling content for consumers, and driving advertising innovation continues to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders. And with that I\u2019d like to call -\u2013 hand the call over to John.","John Nallen","Thanks, Lachlan and good afternoon everyone. To start out I\u2019ll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky in November of 2014, our comparative reported financial results for the second quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the past we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior period, and most of my comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis.","In the second quarter, adjusted revenues of $7.4 billion declined slightly from the year ago quarter as higher revenues at both our Cable Network and Television segments were offset by lower revenues at our film business. Note that adverse foreign currency movements combined with the absence of Shine, negatively impacted quarterly revenue comparisons by approximately $340 million in the aggregate. Absent these factors, our second quarter adjusted revenues would\u2019ve increased 4% over the prior year. Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.73 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago. This increase was led by the Cable Network segment and was partially offset by slightly lower results at our Television and Film segments.","Overall, this quarter\u2019s EBITDA results include an approximate $110 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements, which reduced our comparative reported results in both our Cable Networks and Film segments. After this impact, our overall quarterly EBITDA growth rate would be 8.5%. From a bottom line perspective we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $674 million or $0.34 per share. ","Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and equity earnings adjustments primarily related to Sky\u2019s acquisitions and dispositions, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.44 this year versus a comparable $0.53 a year ago. But as a reminder, last year\u2019s net income included the recognition of certain non-recurring tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share. ","So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the second quarter and we\u2019ll start with the Cable Networks segment, where total segment EBITDA of $1.25 billion was up 8% on segment revenue growth of 9%. Domestic revenues increased 11% in total, led by affiliate fee growth of 10% and advertising increases of 3%. Fox News and our domestic sports channels led the advertising growth posting double-digit percentage increases, but this was partially offset by lower revenues at FX due to reduced ratings against a year-ago comp that included the final season of Sons of Anarchy. ","EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher regional and national sports rights costs. Also note that the inclusion of the National Geographic Partner\u2019s business that were acquired in November, added approximately $70 million to quarterly other revenues and about the same to expenses. So those acquired businesses were significant to second quarter EBITDA. ","Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 6%, driven by a 15% increase in advertising revenues with strong growth at both Star and the Fox International channels. Reported international affiliate revenues were essentially flat against the prior year as low double-digit organic growth led by FIC was offset by negative foreign currency movements. Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% over the prior year period from strong local currency growth at both Star and the Fox International channels, which was partially offset by an approximate $60 million negative impact from foreign exchange. ","Turning to our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $279 million, $11 million lower than a year ago. Revenues increased 6% overall, led by low double-digit Ad revenue growth at the Fox Network and higher retransmission consent revenues. This overall revenue increase was achieved despite the cyclically lower political advertising revenues at the stations due to last year's mid-term elections and too fewer world series games this year versus last. The revenue gain was offset by increased programming expenses principally from contractual step ups in our NFL and MOB rights. ","At the film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $302 million down $34 million versus last year. This quarter's higher contributions from the film studio owing largely to the successful theatrical release of the Martian were more than offset by lower TV production contributions and those reduced contributions were from the substantial increase in the number of new first year series delivered and their related initial deficits as well as lower contributions from Sons of Anarchy which aired its final season last year. ","Additionally foreign exchange movements negatively impacted this quarters segment EBITDA by approximately $50 million. Revenues decreased 14% primarily reflecting both difficult home entertainment comparisons to last year's very successful releases including X-Men Days of Future Past and Dawn of Planet of the Apes as well as the absence of revenues from showing. ","Shifting over to capital management from July 1, through today we repurchased approximately $3.5 billion worth of Fox A shares of which approximately $3 billion has been against our buyback authorization of $5 billion. During the second quarter we also completed our planned investments in National Geographic Partners and the Maa TV channels at Star. ","In addition in the quarter we issued $1 billion in new debt repayed $200 million in maturities and were approximately $500 million of future maturities over the next year. At this halfway point in our fiscal year there are a couple of obvious headwinds that will impact our full year performance outlook. First, we continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency rate comparisons in our sizeable international Cable and Film operations. While the local currency performance at these businesses is strong, the converted U.S. dollar amounts continue to be affected by the strengthened dollar. Just for perspective last August when we gave full year guidance for fiscal 2016 earnings, we estimated that currency changes would negatively impact our growth rate by 3 percentage points or approximately $200 million based on exchange rates at that time. ","So far in fiscal 2016, currency rate movements have already adversely impacted the six month EBITDA results by approximately $220 million. And based on where exchange rates are today, the full year impact from currency movements will be approximately $350 million or nearly a 6 percentage point impact on our EBITDA growth. ","Additionally it\u2019s clear that our content production businesses have underperformed our original plans largely from the theatrical releases of most of our films so far despite the success of The Martian. So based on these principal factors and all of the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 will be in the range of flat to up low single-digits above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015.","With that let me turn it over to James. ","James Murdoch","Thanks John and good afternoon everyone. As Lachlan said earlier we are confident in the business is really on track to support our long term objectives. However two main factors, continued currency movement against us and disappointing commercial results from the film business are simply too significant for us to offset over the next six months to hit our original near term target. But if our only goal was to hit short-term targets we\u2019d pursue efforts like cutting programming cost at the expense of building future profits. That\u2019s not our approach. ","We think shareholder value is better built through long term investment and growth. Our near-term outlook should not detract from the fact that in the first of the year we\u2019ve accomplished much. We renegotiated or negotiated multiyear agreements with two of our largest U.S. distributors. Successfully achieving pricing and revenue goals as well as providing for better products for customers. FBC had its highest rated autumn in four years and Fox News is like number one across all cable channels. We completed the national geographic partner\u2019s transaction and the acquisition of the broadcast business of Maa TV in India. We reorganized our international channels business, as well as made significant strides in cost management across the company as we reshaped the company to best compete in the future. And as we start our second half, we're delivering outstanding new content across our markets, including the X-Files, Lucifer, American Idol and Glee Fly at FBC to name a few. The People versus O.J. Simpson, the American Crime Story and Baskets at FX, a new season of Kabaddi at Star, and a strong post-season at the NFL, capping the second most watched NFL season on Fox ever. ","At FBC we're encouraged by the clear turnaround underway. Broadcast season to date prime time ratings have stabilized and overall Ad revenues for the network were up in the quarter. While linear ratings at Fox show much improvement, the more meaningful measure of video consumption is 30 day multi-platform viewing, which is up mid-single digits season to date. Whether the show is being watched on linear broadcast or on a time-shifted basis all viewers are alive, so all live viewers need to be measured. And in order to better monetize that viewing we've been focused on innovation, with new Ad products and packaging options that are showing clear results. There's a sizeable opportunity to monetize this audience and its one that we're determined to seize. ","That said, the bulk of our broadcast revenue today is from linear advertising and in the quarter performance was strong. National scatter is up at 20% premiums versus up fronts and local station markets were up 3% to 4% in the second quarter, excluding political spending. Lachlan commented earlier on our production businesses and while we've fallen behind our earlier expectations we continue to invest in developing and producing the creative assets that will drive the business in the future. ","At our non-consolidated businesses, we're making good progress too. In fact Sky recently reported first half fiscal 2016 earnings with 10% earnings per share growth driven by the addition of 337,000 new customers in the December quarter. And Hulu also continues to grow, deepening its content offering and adding customers. Hulu is an important platform for us to roll out our targeted and interactive Ad capabilities and new Ad prepackaging for customers, initiatives that are off to a great start. ","So while the team has much work to do, the progress we've made in the quarter against our long-term goals have been good and we think the key fundamentals to our long-term success are in place. Investments in our brands are reaping rewards, our international portfolio continues to flourish particularly at Star in India, our sports and news audiences are expanding, our U.S. broadcast business is stabilizing, and we're implementing solutions to improve monetization, and while short-term film performance is obviously a disappointment, the business is fundamentally sound and the 20th Century Fox Television with strength of several new series will add considerable value for years to come. As I said at the outset shareholder value is built through long-term investment and growth and we, in this exciting time for our company and industry, are confident we have the right assets and strategies in place to achieve that goal. With that we're very happy to take your questions. ","Reed Nolte","Ryan, now we're happy to take questions from the investment community. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thanks. I just want to follow up on James\u2019s comment on Hulu. All of the partners -- well I guess all the investors have been ramping up -\u2013 you\u2019ve been ramping up investment in new programming. It\u2019s obviously an important asset but I'm just, can you comment on how effective you think these recent investments have been in terms of establishing the brand and the subscriber base? Most of the industry has been very supportive of holding back expert [ph] rights and accumulating greater stacking rights for Pay-TV providers. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys have -\u2013 how you as a company are viewing the risks and opportunities Hulu faces in this current environment?","John Nallen","Thanks, Jessica. Sure, happy to talk about that. Look, I think as I said Hulu is an important asset for us and its one that we're excited to see the growth and I think all the partners would say that. And we're excited to see the real innovation that\u2019s happening at Hulu in terms of creating new options for customers, both with respect to add innovation, new ways to monetize inventory there, as well as these ad-free options, the ad-free tier that actually is going well. ","I think Hulu is going to continue to develop and I think we're very focused and Hulu\u2019s very focused on how it continues to innovate in terms of products and packaging to expand its offerings and grow into larger segments. So, I think as a distributor of our programming we think it was very important and we think it\u2019s a good distributor of our programming and we are really happy to push it forward. ","With that said we\u2019re also very focused on distributing our products and our programs through our other clients and other distributors the MVPDs and others, and with respect to stacking rights, with respect to all of this -- sort of the construct of the -- Windows. We were very focused on first and foremost creating a customer experience around our product, it is very, very good creating an ease of discoverability if you will so they can find the product and get it at the right time. We are interested in having a fewer hold backs outside the Asgard [ph] Windows so that we can actually provide a better product for customers and provide our MVPD and over the top distributors with a better ability to deliver a good product experience. ","So I don\u2019t think those two things are incompatible at all and I think we have to see our distributors, be it an online distributor like Hulu or a traditional facilities based distributor like cable company. I think actually from a customer's perspective the package of those products just needs to be great and if you ever discover the programs in a right way. SO we also need to be as a supplier able to take our brands to those platforms and have more flexibility with respect to how the product is found, how it is stacked, how its consumed. More flexibility with respect to how advertising innovation works and what we can do. As well as I think an understanding of data capabilities in a sense who is using our products particularly as the streaming element or the time shifted element grows at such a big clip because that\u2019s a really important part. So I don\u2019t think those two things are mutually exclusive in anyway and we are very excited that Hulu was able to really set the pace in terms of innovation in a lot of these areas. ","Jessica Reif Cohen","Right. Can I just do a quick follow up, in the trade I don\u2019t know if you announced anything but the cost saving activity at both studios film and television\/cable networks, can you talk a bit how impactful that will be and when is it, is it a fiscal 2017 event?","John Nallen","I think first of all cost management is something that happens in a business on a continuous basis. So while there was a public event with some changes that we are making at the networks group and at the studios in the company there, we focus on cost across the business all the time. We have quantified, we haven't really quantified overall how that works. But I think it is more a 2017 and 2018 and going forward to really make the business the right shape. One number that\u2019s been out there is $250 million of savings around this particular program. But these are programs that are going to be ongoing. ","Lachlan K. Murdoch","And Jessica they run across all the businesses not just the studios. ","Jessica Reif Cohen","Okay, thank you. ","John Nallen","Thank you Jessica. Ryan could we have the next question please. ","Operator","Comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the new guidance clearly with what's going on in the market and in the macro environment there is some worries about a recession and you guys have the big global business that achieves that in terms of your advertising business. So I guess I just wondered to what extent is any macro uncertainty embedded in the new guidance or would any uncertainty there be incremental or kind of on an added risk to the new guidance John that you provided?","John Nallen","Well Anthony it would have to be pretty significant to dramatically impact it because there is really just six months left in this period of time. We got good visibility around affiliate fees, the advertising market feels pretty good. So I don\u2019t and internationally businesses are operating pretty well also. So I am not -- I don\u2019t think there is a dramatic issue outstanding on a macro-economic basis. I think we put into it what we know today. We don\u2019t know beyond what we know today so that\u2019s whats reflected in our outlook. ","Anthony DiClemente","Okay, thanks and then maybe a follow up, maybe this is for James on your relationships with the MVPDs, when you guys put up double digit affiliate fee growth and that\u2019s quite strong but we continue to get questions from investors about cost cutting, about the pace of the subscribers in your business and there continue to be speculation about these minimum subscriber limits. Do you think some of the MVPDs are running up against their contractual minimums on the subscriber limits and if so how should we interpret that. With that slow subscriber losses, slow cord cutting that might be driven by these skinny bundles either for the industry and or for Fox? Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Anthony. Look, I think on our relationship with our distributors or the MVPD is some of our distributors, its -- I would say actually they\u2019re \u2013 first of all, they\u2019re pretty good. As I mentioned in my comments we've renewed two important large affiliate agreements in the last quarter that we felt both sides really were able to achieve their goals. We haven\u2019t seen any material change in the distribution requirements or minimum distribution requirements in any of those agreements, and I think the strategy that we've laid out and that we've executed over the last few years are really investing in these brands, investing in the rights around these brands, and being able to offer something that would mean, that really matters for our distributors\u2019 customers has borne fruit for us with respect to pricing and distribution gains. ","With respect to the whole -\u2013 the question of overall, the affiliate universe and the subscriber universe of the MVPDs. As John mentioned in his comments, well, obviously the total universe for extended basic for those MVPDs has contracted, we continue to see growth. Our networks are distributed at different levels, each one different to another, some of them were young like Fox Sports 1 or some of the Nat Geo brands and some are more fully distributed. So we have pretty good visibility on reasonable growth going forward and I think the things like minimum distribution guarantees, etcetera haven\u2019t been really impacted, at least in our latest negotiations and latest renewals and we think that\u2019s encouraging. ","Anthony DiClemente","Okay, thanks, James. ","James Murdoch","Thanks, Anthony. Ryan, can we have the next question please?","Operator","That comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Douglas Mitchelson","Thanks so much, John, I think maybe a couple of questions for James. James, I was just hoping for a further update on Star, maybe a walkthrough of the sports rights that might be out to bid and any other investment prospects you might see that would sort of hold back the trajectory of margins we're all hoping for and certainly anything driving revenue that\u2019s sort of new. And separately, Thursday Night Football obviously went to CBS NBC and I imagine that was something that Fox was looking at. Certainly feels like it would fit with Fox, any comments you want to make around the dynamics of Thursday Night Football might be helpful to understand your investment strategy? Thanks. ","James Murdoch","Thanks, Doug. Well, first of all, sports rights, as we've said before, really it\u2019s around -\u2013 we're a big investor in sports, we believe in sports as a real driver of the business, but that said, you make choices around different packages, you make choices about how much you're investing in different things. With respect to Star, the landscape for sports rights in the near term, really probably dominated by what happens with the BCCI, the domestic board of control for cricket, India and the IPL, the pro-cricket league, domestically there. And we have to see how that shapes out over the next couple of years. I think it\u2019s in the next year, the IPL picture becomes clearer. That\u2019s something that we don\u2019t hold today. But fundamentally there's nothing that we see out there that we see or would necessitate us or our adjusting our goals for the business, both from a margin perspective and absolute profit perspective over the next four to five years. ","The Star business is going very strong, and while there are some of those lumpy sports rights out there, we're really through the peak investment in those as we've said before. And with respect to Thursday Night Football, as you would expect we're a partner of the NFLs and a very happy partner of the NFLs, and as players worry, discussions were had around Thursday Night Football, ultimately the NFL and NBC and CBS were able to get a good deal on there, but we're very happy with where we are with the NFL. Our Sunday package is something that\u2019s very, very strong. As I said in my comments earlier, this NFL season was our second best ever and we feel very strong going forward with those rights well into the next decade. ","Douglas Mitchelson","Great. Thank you very much. ","Lachlan K. Murdoch","Ryan, please next question, please. ","Operator","And that will come from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Bryan Kraft","Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask you two questions if I could; one, just wanted to hear your thoughts on the need for you to have rights to off streamed, direct to consumer, RSN service, and just wondering if you had obtained any of those rights yet through your agreements? And secondly, just on Hulu, is there likely to be another funding round for Hulu coming up this year or next year or is Hulu at a point where it\u2019s close to being self-funded or have you already increased the funding, quietly? Thank you.","John Nallen","Thanks. On the streaming RSN is this \u2013 I think, we have \u2013 the one change in rights has been around baseball, which is the ability \u2013 we obtained the ability for the RSNs to do in-market streaming of baseball games on an authenticated basis alongside the RSN distribution. But that would be -- but there is no plan to do any separate over the top kind of RSN business. There its really embedded in the experience of the overall brand of the RSN in that and those are -- I think we announced that recently. And with respect to Hulu, the needs of the business some of the shareholders are going to be looking at on an going basis if we see the opportunity to really grow the business well then investments, all the shareholders are going to be have to look at. ","Bryan Kraft","If I could just ask a follow up is the focus on Hulu going to continue to be domestic or is there a case where it might make sense to broaden out internationally?","John Nallen","I think primarily domestic right now. I think there is an opportunity internationally for Hulu to compete but that\u2019s again a decision that all the shareholders would have to make at the time with the company. ","Bryan Kraft","Okay thanks. ","John Nallen","Thank you Bryan. Ryan can we have the next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. So taking on the scene of cash flow, John, I wonder if you could just remind us what your expectations or what our expectations should be around working cap use this year. I think you had said similar this year to last year but you are running I believe quite a bit above that in the first six months. And I didn\u2019t know if what's happened in the marketplace on the credit market front had changed the company\u2019s perspective on leverage or cash balances, maybe you could remind us on that? And then one on related since you\u2019ve called out film performance this year being less than expected thought it would be good on to ask about whether you need an update on Avatar timing, what that looks like at this point? Thank you. ","James Murdoch","Okay, Ben thanks. I\u2019ll handle the cash pieces of it. Our first half of the year is always a big working capital investment period. We got the biggest billings for the NFL for our fall season and this year we\u2019re a particularly large number of releases that were in the last two quarters of the calendar year. So it is just traditional for us to have a big receivable in working capital investment it also is a prior inventory because as you know we make all of the NFL payments as an example before the end of the calendar year with the biggest games happening really after the calendar year with post season, etc. ","So looking at this period it is not unusual at all as against our working capital build up would be in any six month December period. For the year we were still at the same place working capital level we expect to be about the same as a year ago. So we are consistent in that regard from what I said back in August. To remind you our targets were to have a $2 billion to $3 billion cash balance and 2.5 to 3 times leverage. Gross leverage on our balance sheet and as we look through the year, to the end of the fiscal year we\u2019ll start approaching those levels there or thereabouts in the next -- around that time or six months after that. And as far as the -- sorry as far as the credit markets we continue to have long dated bonds, we look at our maturities, and unless we have a capital need which isn't present right now we\u2019re not accessing the capital markets in any unusual way given where they are right now. ","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. ","Lachlan K. Murdoch","And then Ben on the Avatar timing there is no update now or no change there that I can give you on that as that all gets worked up. But I would say that we\u2019re really -- we\u2019re pretty confident about the overall slate in the film business leading up to that going forward. As, often mentioned before with the X-Men and the Independence Day coming up in the balance of this year after Deadpool just next week but we think a real strong slight leading up to that. And the Avatar when it is confirmed we\u2019ll be disclosing that I am sure very loudly. ","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks a lot. ","James Murdoch","Thanks Ben. Ryan give the next question please. ","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead. ","Richard Greenfield","Hi, thanks for taking the question. When you look at Facebook which added like 2 million of Ad revenue in calendar of Q4 year-over-year growing something like 50 odd plus percent, how do you think about the importance of mobile to Fox overall. Do you all need to start new business meaning kind of invest organically in new launches, do you need to acquire businesses to just overall shift your exposure more towards mobile versus legacy TV, how do you think about that?","Lachlan K. Murdoch","Thanks Rich for the question. I think first of all I would just say what we are really focused on is making our programming the creative assets, the creative assets that we make available as wide away as possible and mobile is increasingly an important part of that as we look at TV everywhere type applications like Sky Go in Europe, for example, increasingly consumed on mobile phones and tablets. As well as consumption in the U.S. growing as video entertainment or audio visual entertainment on mobile platforms. The key thing for us is how do we invest in the capabilities to monetize that viewing, measure it and monetize in the right way and I think we would look at investing to create those capabilities as we have for example with the formation of our advanced Ad products group, etc. which is making real headway in streaming. ","I think that I would look at the mobile piece for us really as just part of the overall streaming landscape as opposed to brand new types of content for us etcetera. For us the priority is how do we execute with our creative assets today as well as we can, make them more available and not less to customers, and how do we really innovate and get better capabilities in terms of how we then monetize that platform going forward. And then in discrete places where there's a really big opportunity we would start a new business. If we look at something like in India, the Hotstar business is a mobile internet-only video platform which we launched early this year or I should say early last year, which has really gotten off to a great start. And that\u2019s sports and entertainment platform that is growing very, very rampantly on the -\u2013 from a mobile consumption point of view in India and we would look at individual brands really being able to embrace those kinds of opportunities going forward. ","Richard Greenfield","And just in terms of overall consolidation space, is there interest, I mean if there was renewed interest from big players, do you think consolidation needs to happen to improve kind of overall industry fundamentals which clearly are concerning investors?","John Nallen","Look, as we've said in the past, we actually are -\u2013 we're pretty happy with the asset mix that we have. While obviously there are times we will be opportunistic. We\u2019ll add assets like we have in this quarter with the talents of the National Geographic Partners agreement as well as our Maa TV acquisition and there are other places where we might look to do similar things. But overall our thesis has been driven by consolidation, our assets, we think are very strong. We think we've simplified our business dramatically over the last number of years. We've invested in these brands to be stronger and more dynamic. And we're very focused on executing the business and the plan as well as we can. ","Richard Greenfield","Thanks very much. ","Lachlan K. Murdoch","Thanks, Rich. Ryan, please another question, please. ","Operator","Comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet","Just a quick question for James Murdoch, I'm sure we're all sitting there with that $500 million of EBITDA in that Star in fiscal 2018. I was just wondering if you could comment, if the rupee doesn\u2019t change relative to where we are now, would you be willing to give us a revised number if FX holds steady?","James Murdoch","A revised number upwards?","Jason Bazinet","However you want. ","James Murdoch","Look I think we've generally assumed modest depreciation over the rupee normalized over a period of time. We found over the years, that sure we get that wrong in a given year, but generally over time that\u2019s held true. And in that -\u2013 and in those numbers we've -\u2013 in those targets we've assumed modest appreciation there. So could go either one way or another but we're not in that business of currency forecasting. But where -\u2013 with sort of historical trends and where the kind of rupee has been and where we think where it might go if it holds the same, we feel pretty confident about the trajectory of the business there. It\u2019s very -\u2013 it\u2019s a strong business with real velocity behind it. ","Jason Bazinet","Thank you very much. ","James Murdoch","Thanks, Jason. Ryan, at this time we have time for, I think, one last question.","Operator","And that will come from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Morris","Thanks guys, good afternoon. Two questions, first, I'm hoping you can talk a little bit about your competitive position relative to Netflix, especially as it pertains to technology and what I mean is, Netflix is spending a lot on technology, hundreds and millions of dollars a year and they used to sort of only be a distributor and now they\u2019re, I would say, infringing on your sort of content territory by launching their own content. So how do you feel about your need to invest in your own technological expertise to compete with them on that front? And then second, on the Regional Sports Networks, you\u2019ve talked about how you like them, the tribal element. The investor concern seems to be around everybody paying for the RSN with a certain price, but maybe from your perspective, how do you look at the price inelasticity there for the true fan who wants that network and do you think maybe that\u2019s underappreciated by those who are concerned about the RSNs? Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Michael. Look, with respect to investment in technology, we invest constantly in the technology around delivering a better product to customers where we can. We have definitely been doing that with respect to advertising innovation, investing in that, creating new capabilities there. And we have also been investing in our capabilities which are improving around domestically here in the U.S. direct to customer distribution with our authenticated apps for example and other platforms. So, we think there is an investment that is ongoing and it will continue. And then around the world where we are -- where we are heavier in direct to customer businesses and product oriented businesses for example, the Sky business. It is very heavy investment in technology that we actually bears real fruit in terms of creating a product for customers that they really like. ","I am not sure that the investment and technology you referred to really has a bearing on the production of creative assets and getting into original production. I think that is kind of a different issue. We feel very good about our ability to do that. I think in the future as we did today, we are going to see a continued competition for talent, continued competition for story tellers, and a continued favorable appetite for various players to invest and there will be multiple internet TV companies doing that including our own. So I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t think the investment technology necessarily has a bearing on that creative output or that competitive dynamic that you mentioned. But it clearly does have a bearing on the product set for customers, how good they are and how you can monetize there as well. ","And as to your second question with the RSNs, I think at this point we feel pretty good about RSN pricing. Where we are anyway, I can't speak for the overall market. And as I said in the renewal of recent distribution agreements earlier we were able to achieve our goals there. For example pricing elasticity for the hardcore fan is something that, there probably is some pricing elasticity there. There is -- pay a lot but I think you have to remember that the RSNs are very broad. They are not just for super fans. The RSNs in many of our markets are the number one rated broadcast platforms in their market, particularly in baseball season where you see markets like St. Louis for example, beating all broadcast networks on those game nights. ","So I think it is a very, very broad offering and one that we tried to price in the fairest way that we can that provides both returns for our partners, the teams in those businesses, but also a fair price for the distributors that they can pass on to customers in the right way. ","Michael Morris","Great, thank you. ","Reed Nolte","At this point we are out of time. Thank you everybody for joining today's call.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2014, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, the call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filings.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to John.","John Nallen","Thank you, Reed. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, our fiscal 2015 year is off to a good start overall, with our first quarter results reflecting double-digit percentage increases in total company revenues, segment EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. I'll expand on this later, but note that the consolidated results from our DBS businesses are included in our reported results and will continue to be until the closing of the sale of these businesses to BSkyB.","The first quarter's financial results were driven by strong top line revenue growth, with total company revenues of $7.89 billion, up 12% compared to the first quarter a year ago, reflecting double-digit increases in our Cable Network and Film segments.","Total segment EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.78 billion, up 10% over the $1.62 billion reported a year ago. This increase was principally led by our Film and Cable Network segments, partially offset by lower contributions from the Television segment. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency movement reduced our total EBITDA growth rate by 3 percentage points.","From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.04 billion as compared to the $768 million we reported in the first quarter a year ago. Included in this year's result is a net after-tax gain reported in equity earnings of affiliates of $172 million, principally related to BSkyB's gain on the sale of shares in ITV. Excluding the net income effect of this gain and last year's gain from participating in BSkyB's share repurchase program as well as the amounts reflected in other net, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.39 this year versus $0.33 in the prior year, an 18% improvement.","Now let me provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Network segment, where overall, total segment revenues increased 15% from last year, highlighted by a 15% increase in affiliate revenues and 11% advertising revenue growth.","With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 18%, primarily from higher average rates, led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News as well as increases from the conversions of our new channels FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network this year also contributed to the growth.","Our reported international affiliate fees were up 8%, reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 16%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, primarily in Latin America. The first quarter advertising revenue growth of 11% reflects domestic advertising increases of 10%, led by the RSNs, FX Networks and FOX News, and reported growth at the international channels up 13%, driven by strong year-over-year increases at STAR.","Total Cable segment EBITDA in the first quarter of $1.04 billion was up 5% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 21% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs.","EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 15% from increased contributions at FOX News, continued strong underlying growth at the RSNs as well as the impact of consolidating the YES Network this year.","Contributions from the FX networks were below last year, but this was expected, due to increased costs for additional hours of original programming, including The Strain, Tyrant and Sons of Anarchy at FX and the launch of The Simpsons at FXX.","International channel EBITDA contributions were below a year ago, as strong double-digit local currency EBITDA growth at FIC was more than offset by both the continued investment we're making in STAR Sports, including this quarter's costs for the India-England cricket series and a negative impact from foreign exchange rates.","At our Television segment, first quarter EBITDA was $174 million as compared to the $231 million in the prior year. This decline largely reflects higher programming costs at the FOX broadcast network, primarily from the combination of additional hours of scripted summer series, higher program cancellation costs and higher rights fees from the new NFL contract.","Total segment revenues were unchanged from the year ago quarter as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 5% decline in advertising revenues, primarily due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network.","Now turning to our Film segment. We reported record first quarter EBITDA of $458 million, a 40% increase over the year-ago results driven by a 17% increase in revenues. This quarter's results include several successful theatrical releases, including Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Maze Runner and The Fault in Our Stars, as well as strong home entertainment contributions from Rio 2. Quarterly results also include increased earnings contributions from our television production businesses led by increased syndication and SVOD revenues.","Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $207 million in the quarter, a $17 million increase over the prior year. This improvement reflects higher subscriber revenues at Sky Deutschland, partially offset by higher programming costs at SKY Italia from their broadcast of the FIFA World Cup.","Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash and $20.2 billion in gross debt. This debt position reflects the $1.2 billion of new long-term debt we issued in September, recognizing that we have approximately $1 billion of scheduled debt maturities over the next 12 months.","With regard to the stock buyback, we repurchased approximately $1.9 billion of FOXA shares from July 1 through today, and we are on pace to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe we previously announced.","So now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. And as a reminder and, as I indicated on our last earnings call, with the Sky transaction expected to close shortly, for guidance purposes we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.","Chase will provide more commentary in a moment around our businesses, and while we have one quarter under our belt, we've seen some puts and takes in the last few months as against our original expectations for fiscal 2015. Clearly, the initial ratings at the FOX broadcast network for the new broadcast season are below our original expectations.","Additionally, the continued strengthening of the dollar results in lower reported U.S. dollar EBITDA from our international businesses, particularly the FOX International Channels. On the plus side, our Filmed Entertainment businesses are performing above initial expectations and, as importantly, our domestic cable network businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations.","So considering these balancing factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we continue to expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 will be in the high single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.","Now finally, since the Sky transaction is expected to close within the next couple of weeks, I thought we would provide a few comments related to how it will affect our reported financial results once completed.","The DBS segment results will no longer be included in our consolidated revenues, EBITDA or depreciation and amortization after the closing date. We will also no longer report any minority interest related to Sky Deutschland's results. For reference, the consolidated DBS segment results will have contributed only around 1% of our annual total adjusted earnings per share in both fiscal 2014 and 2015.","For the periods after the closing, and excluding the impact of BSkyB's purchase price amortization, we do not anticipate the transaction to have a material impact on our fiscal '15 equity earnings from affiliates. And finally, we do not anticipate the transaction to have a significant impact on our anticipated effective tax rate going forward.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Chase.","Chase Carey","Thanks, John. As John noted, we got off to a good start with our first quarter results, keeping us on plan to achieve our financial targets for this year and next, as we laid out last August.","While we are experiencing some headwinds at the FOX broadcast network and from negative foreign currency trends, we have considerable momentum and strength at our cable networks and content businesses to drive overall results. Our RSNs, regular season baseball ended strong and the new hockey season is off to a solid start.","At FOX News, this past quarter, the channel hit an all-time high in ratings during primetime weeknights and was cable's most watched channel overall.","At FX, we are seeing continued momentum from our original programming efforts, giving us even more confidence in the investments we're making. Likewise, the landmark deal for the Simpsons as an anchor for FXX has already paid dividends with record viewership and overall ratings that rank FXX as cable's fastest-growing network on a year-on-year basis.","FOX Sports 1 has also delivered steady ratings growth over the past several months and is showing momentum as new rights come to air. With the college basketball, NASCAR, FIFA Women's World Cup and the U.S. Open launching in coming quarters, FS1 is on track with our plan.","Internationally, our channels business, FIC, delivered a solid performance despite a tough economy in Europe and currency headwinds.","In India, our entertainment business continues to build on our leadership position and the India-England cricket matches propelled our sports channels to new heights. We were also thrilled to recently lock up the World Cup cricket rights into the next decade as an anchor for our sports business.","At our broadcast business, we clearly had a difficult start to the new season. The rebuilding process we began this summer, led by a new management team, will take some time. Gotham has had a solid start and Brooklyn Nine-Nine has performed well on Sunday night. We look forward to a few mid-season premieres like Empire, but we know we have work to do. Still a couple of hits can make a big difference in this business.","On the sports side, the NFL is off to a strong start and we were pleased to see the World Series go seven games.","Another source of strength in the quarter were our content businesses on both the film and TV side. This strength looks to continue with Gone Girl and upcoming releases, Exodus and Night at the Museum, as well as increasing global demand for our television content by digital platforms.","As you're all aware, we will soon close on our agreement to sell SKY Italia and our stake in Sky Deutschland to BSkyB, which will create a pan-European Sky business. Our firm belief is that a united Sky will be more efficient, innovative and effective in launching new products, ultimately creating a better value proposition for both consumers and shareholders.","In summary, our first quarter reflects the steady underlying growth of our core businesses, giving us confidence in our ability to hit our 2016 targets and create long-term value for our shareholders.","Before turning to questions, I'd like to address three industry issues getting a lot of attention: The state of the TV ad market, trends in network ratings and the impact of digital platforms on viewership in traditional business models. A number of people claim that these three issues portend new challenges for our business \u2013 that television advertising is shifting to new digital platforms; that ratings reflect a decline in the viewership of our product and that new over-the-top digital platforms will undermine traditional business models.","My first observation is that these concerns are overblown, particularly in the short term. The television ad market is a mixed story, but the issue is primarily the economy. Pricing has actually held up pretty well, but volume is a bit softer than expected due to a lack of confidence, leading businesses to buy short term or keep the money in their pocket. Actually, our core cable networks each saw solid growth in advertising this last quarter.","On the ratings front, network ratings are down, but the issue generally is not popularity of content, particularly hit content. The issue is that an increasing amount of viewership is occurring in ways and places not reflected in traditional network ratings. And as it relates to new digital platforms, the traditional bundle, while mature, continues to have real legs. But while all the concerns may be overblown today, these are real issues that while challenging also present real opportunities for us.","On the advertising issue, the priority for our industry is to develop the capability to offer a more effective and efficient message, combined with a more engaging consumer experience that increases the value of our messages to both advertisers and consumers.","To address the decline in traditional network ratings, we need to more effectively measure and monetize the viewership on these new digital platforms and devices. We need to achieve this goal while recognizing that the consumer is going to demand more choice and control in tomorrow's digital world. For example, if we want the consumer to use a robust VOD service instead of a DVR, we have to make it a better experience.","When it comes to the emergence of new digital platforms, we actually view this as the most exciting and important opportunity for our future growth. To start, it means there will be increased competition for our content. It also means we'll be able to engage the consumer more directly to create a more exciting and valuable experience. The emergence of the new digital offerings also doesn't spell the end of the traditional bundle. In fact, we believe the traditional bundle offers great value to consumers and will be the primary consumer package for years to come.","However, we also recognize that traditional bundle is fraying at the edge due to both millennials with different lifestyles and economic pressures in tough times. There will be a gradually increasing number of consumers that want more choice in programming options. We believe that most of these customers will still want a bundle of programming as a foundation. It just may be a somewhat different bundle and proposition. The key challenge for us is to build these choices in ways that fairly compensate us for our content and brands and do not undermine more established business models.","Overall, we recognize that we're in a period of change, but we truly look at this as a glass half-full opportunity. There's a real chance for us to build exciting new areas of growth if we can create more exciting choices for customers, a more valuable proposition for advertisers, while maintaining a discipline that enables us to manage the trade-off required to ensure fair value for our product.","There'll be winners and losers as this process evolves. We believe exploding digital demand and platforms puts content in the sweet spot. And within the content world, we believe those with hit content and brands at scale are best positioned to come out on top. We look forward to tackling these opportunities.","With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Chase. Now, Chase, James and John will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And our first question in queue will come from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Thanks. So my one big double question is, could you, Chase or James, John, whoever, talk about the use of BSkyB proceeds? You said you're closing in the quarter. You have a lot of money coming in and you haven't changed your target capital returns. And then the second thing is, just a follow-up on Chase's comment on demand for content. There's a view in the market that demand for television content is exceptionally strong on a global basis. Now I'm just wondering if you could change that focus a little bit to film. Your film numbers have been great and you seem pretty bullish on the outlook for your titles. What do you see in terms of changes in trends, on whether it's on a global basis or even domestically?","Chase Carey","I guess on the BSkyB proceeds, yes, I mean we do expect those proceeds in, I guess, the next week or two weeks. But it isn't going to dramatically \u2013 drastically change our plans. I mean we are, as John said, we've got the buyback in place, we're on course for it. We recognize we'll have excess liquidity that will result from this. And it hasn't changed our longer-term goals that we think is the right place to get to. We recognize we won't be there at the end of this buyback, but we will continue to work to get to the place we think we should be. And that's going to be through the combination of initiatives that we've talked in the past, investing in our core businesses, returning capital to shareholders. And we will do that \u2013 continue to do that over time.","In terms of demand for product, I think the film demand, we feel really good about it. I mean, certainly internationally, you continue to see growth, and even domestically. I think the place \u2013 I mean, there's been a lot written about box office this year. But I think if you look at sort of the demand in digital, I mean, probably one of the more exciting arenas for us in the film business in the U.S. has been the really pretty dynamic growth in the digital and home entertainment space. And I think that will continue to build and we've been excited about the digital HD initiative we had to put our films out in a new window a bit ahead of DVDs. And we think that's a business we feel very good about. It's obviously, beyond just the year we've had, we think film business continues to have real demand around the world.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Thanks. I have one for Chase and one for John. So Chase, you talked about the new digital models that are emerging for distribution. When we hear that, it's often mini-bundles and virtual MSOs, like the Sony project we're hearing about. So how can you make sure that, if that's the digital bundles we're seeing going forward, that your RSNs are part of that package? Or how do you navigate what people want to do is perhaps make slimmer bundles without RSNs.","Chase Carey","I mean, I guess actually realistically, the RSNs are not different than any other channel we have, and we are engaged with \u2013 there are a lot of players who seem to be wanting to enter this space. We touched on a few of them. We are doing our own continued work and analysis on how best do we develop these opportunities and we're looking at it from all directions. And as we do, I guess, as I said in the opening comments, we're going to ensure that both individually and in aggregate, we develop these opportunities in ways that don't simply undermine our existing core businesses. And we think we have the breadth and strength of product to be able to do that. I think in many ways, as you look at some of these offerings, I think they'll, in many ways, likely reinforce the attractiveness of a bundle of content. And I think as it comes to sports, I think what you'll find is there's a reason sports has the highest cost. It's because it's the most important product, and it's the product people, first and foremost, want to access on these platforms.","So I think we're going to \u2013 use the phrases disciplined and manage the trade-offs to make sure. We want to be proactive, we want to be \u2013 I think we want to be a step ahead, not a step behind of leading into developing these business models. But we think we have an array of content that are really fundamental to anybody's content experience and look to work with third parties as well as do our own work to figure out how do we develop these opportunities.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","And then for John, you know your cable expenses grew 21% in this quarter. Can you give us a reminder of what the cadence will be for the rest of the year on cable network expenses?","John Nallen","Yes I think what we've indicated for the year, we expect high-teens growth, I mentioned that on our last call. I think you'll find the biggest step-up will happen in the third fiscal quarter, and that's most notably because of the sports cost at STAR for the Cricket World Cup.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. I have two. James, can you talk about the Shine-Endemol deal? TV production is an area where I think everyone is quite bullish. And in many ways you guys are sort of selling your asset, one of your assets in that space. It's going to move below the line, which is a different trend than FOX has been following which is to consolidate more. So why is this the right strategy in TV production for the Shine asset? And then I just had a follow-up for Chase. It sounds like you're exploring at FOX your own over-the-top potential product to address the broadband-only sub-base. I just want to see if you would flush that out. Your comments earlier sounded like you're heading at least exploratory at looking at that type of offering.","James Murdoch","Ben, on the Shine-Endemol transaction, I mean \u2013 look, I think, first of all, the television production business that remains wholly consolidated or the businesses that remain wholly consolidated within Twenty-First Century Fox i.e. TCFTV and our production capability in places like India and around the place, remain very important to us and are much, much larger than the Shine business for example.","Really with Shine and Endemol, we saw an opportunity to create something as a joint venture that was really an order of magnitude greater than what the individual parts were. And we thought that with Shine and Endemol coming together we could create something that was, on an independent production basis, really a world leader. So it was really opportunistic, to be able to create something that we feel \u2013 we hope it's going to be awaiting some regulatory clearances, but we would hope that we're closing that transaction before the end of the year. And we think it's a very, very attractive business.","Now generally speaking, we've been seeking over the last number of years, as you mentioned, to kind of simplify our operating model to have probably fewer joint ventures and fewer minorities and things like that, but I don't think we want to foreclose opportunities to ourselves that are really unique in being too orthodox about that. This was one of those unique opportunities where the Endemol asset and the core assets and Shine really fit together very well, and we thought that \u2013 and we do believe that it can be something that's a very special new company formed. And we decided to take that opportunity as opposed to leave it out there.","Chase Carey","And I guess I'll just add, one reality at Shine, because it is not consolidated, the profits of Shine won't be going forward. It won't be in the place. But again, as James said, I don't think we want to be locked in to any particular. We want to be opportunistic, and this is a way for us to really be part of a very unique globally leading production company.","In terms of digital, look, we're looking at everything. When I said looking at it ourselves, I think what I mean is we're not just responding to third parties that want to put together bundles of products and offerings. We're making our own analysis what do we think consumers want. So I don't \u2013 it was not implying that there's anything imminent we're doing on our own. We're not going to be just simply reactive to what we think can \u2013 what should be the models out there for consumers in the marketplace. And I think we want to make sure we are proactive in forming our own judgments about what types of bundles and what types of offerings and what are the other ways in which we can create attractive offerings that are additive to our business as it exists today.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you. My question\u2019s on your earlier commentary about measurement being a bit of an issue in terms of there's a fair amount of viewership that's not captured in ratings. I guess I'd be interested in your commentary on how you think that might, I guess, change going forward and could it \u2013 can it change going forward and can you capture some of that viewership? And then just a follow-up, sorry if I missed it, but did you give a organic advertising gross number for cable?","John Nallen","So if I look organically, I'll give it both on domestic affiliate and domestic ad, which is really excluding the YES Network. So on affiliate, it would be low double digits. And on domestic ad, it would be mid-single digits organically which excludes the YES Network.","Chase Carey","Yes. And in terms of monetizing viewership across all these platforms, it's really, I guess, there are multitude of ways we need to pursue that. Some of its measurement, I mean, I don't, I think we all recognize that there are issues in terms of the quality and accuracy of the measuring devices today. I think it's an issue, I wouldn't say it's the issue, but I think it's a issue we need to deal with. We're still not measuring some of the mobile, the most obvious one, still not measuring viewership in that. We still only move from measuring three days to seven days. There's obviously a lot of viewership that happens beyond seven days. There are ways we need to make \u2013 create consumer experiences. I talked about VOD versus DVRs. One of the things we'd like to do is create a better experience for consumers that may have the opportunity to have messages in that, that they find more attractive and more rewarding than a DVR that we can shift viewership from a DVR to a VOD experience. That's a positive for us.","We need to make these messages more interesting to consumers, more engaging to consumers. I think you find just simply giving them a choice between two ads makes it \u2013 makes them more engaged because they feel like they have some control over it. So it is really doing an array of things that we need to take advantage of, that enable us to monetize our viewership much beyond the traditional L plus 3 or L plus 7 business we have today. We are selling into some of these digital platforms, but clearly, we don't have them. But targeting another dynamic tools anywhere close to where we want to be. We\u2019re really in the first inning of trying to develop that. Fortunately, I think there is a focus on it. We are starting to make some headway, but we have a long way to go.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Chase, in your sort of concluding comments there, you seem to have a real conviction that some of the softer dynamics in the ad market had more to do with macro weakness in secular share shift to the ad pie from TV to digital. What gives you that conviction? Are the advertisers definitively telling you that? Are you seeing any differences across categories? Also, are you seeing anything in terms of cancellations in calendar 1Q that would tell you something? And I guess lastly, you've unified ad sales across cable and broadcast under Toby Byrne now. Will you be doing anything differently now that you sort of have a unified platform for TV ad sales?","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean, it's a little bit of all of those. I mean, certainly, a big part of it is talking to those in the ad \u2013 in the agencies and the advertisers. And really what you mostly get back from them is a comment that there is a marginal shift to digital and that marginal shift is probably going to \u2013 is certainly a direction, I don't think it's a \u2013 it's not a one-year phenomena, there's no question, there are values being offered in these digital platforms that people want, need to be \u2013 that advertisers want and are better for consumers. That's why we need to offer them.","So it will keep going that way. But at this point, it is by \u2013 from all the people we talk to, whether it's advertisers, clients and the like, it's a pretty modest shift. And what you get back is \u2013 much more of the issue is confidence in the short-term economy and how they feel about it. We do hope the holidays, new budgets in January will put some money back in the advertising system. But it is basically sort of our analysis and our interacting with the wider array of players that we deal with in the marketplace. And what was the other? Oh, and Toby Byrne, I mean, I guess, in many ways, the restructuring we did there is sort of recognizing the changing business we're in. I think aligning \u2013 we had cable and broadcast separate. I think we felt to be opportunistic, it made more sense, we\u2019d already taken that step in sports. So we're clearly taking that step now across the board.","And increasingly, it's not just cable and broadcast, it's these digital platforms and developing new capabilities that need to go across all these platforms. And I think we recognize that we need to look at it much more holistically and figure out how do we monetize this viewership with \u2013 from a top-down philosophy that takes advantage of all the trends that we see emerging. And we thought this structure really is a structure that's built for the world we're going to compete in going forward as opposed to the world that we've competed in looking back.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And cancellations, I'm sorry, I might have missed the answer there in calendar 1Q?","Chase Carey","I don't think there's anything \u2013 there's nothing out of the ordinary in that regard.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Nomura Securities","First for John and then for Chase. John, I think the 13% international ad revenue was what you reported. Can you please give us that on a constant currency basis? And then John one other one also on your guidance. I'm wondering on those puts and takes, does your guidance imply a recovery in FOX TV ratings from here? Or do they \u2013 does it imply similar ratings performance that we've seen going forward? And then I guess bigger picture for Chase. As we talk about these digital platforms and Internet delivered video taking share of the market, the buyers of ad seem to be getting a lot more sophisticated, whether it's ROI analysis, programmatic buying and the like. So I guess the question is as a seller of new digital ads, be it dynamic ad insertion and so forth, over the next several years, are you investing in the data technology on the sell side of your ad business? I'm talking about things like digital inventory yield systems, custodial systems and the like, so that they could better interface with those digital ad exchanges or programmatic ad buyers in the marketplace.","John Nallen","Let me cover your first two financial questions. On the international ad growth reported at 13%, it's about the same on a constant currency basis, and that's principally because the real big growth in the quarter on advertising was at STAR where the rupee really is unchanged year-on-year. And then for the puts and takes on the network, it's our best estimate, really, where we think the ratings will be, particularly on upcoming programming. We've got pretty well locked in, obviously, what we know at this point, so we've taken our best estimate right now as to what we think the upcoming shows will rate.","Chase Carey","Yes. I guess I'd say on the broadcasting side, I mean we don't really \u2013 relative for this year and next, I mean I guess you can go back to 16, the assumption we had a year ago. We don't assume we're getting back to that. So whether it's other business that's covering it or using up a degree of what probably, I guess, I'd call it cushion that was in those numbers is probably the reality and, I guess, likewise for this year. I think we've made realistic assumptions for it, but they probably, given where we are today, assume a shortfall in the broadcast business against our expectations \u2013 it's covered by upside in other businesses for this year.","John Nallen","Notably in the film business.","Chase Carey","In terms of data \u2013 developing the tools we need and the capabilities we need to really take advantage of the digital world, I mean the simple answer is, yes, we're doing a lot of it and we're doing it, I'd say we're still midstream \u2013 not even midstream, we are probably in the early stages of it, but certainly not just starting. And whether that's creating databases or technical capabilities, whether it's for ad sales or whether it's how we more effectively use our own time to promote, to market our own products, we're engaged with third parties that obviously bring us an array of expertise, both on how do we analyze data, how to manage data and third parties that bring capabilities in terms of a much more dynamic ad experience and messaging experience than we have in-house working with all of them that really figure out how do we develop these, certainly take time. But it's a priority for us to develop the capabilities to really take advantage.","And look, we think our product is the product first and foremost that people want in all these platforms. And so it is, I use the phrase glass half-full, I think it really is a glass half-full, that there's a lot of upside for us if we can tap into and build those capabilities to better monetize our viewership while creating a better consumer experience. And so certainly that's a big priority for us going forward.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","So Chase or James or whoever, you mentioned several times the changing consumer behaviors in these new platforms. You specifically called out VOD and DVR and some of the over-the-top stuff, all that is conceivably ad-supported. So I'd love to get your specific current thinking on the SVOD window, in particular, and the value you're getting from your content there versus the fact that it does take viewers out of the ad-supported world and how you think about the role of the SVOD window going forward and also relative to Hulu and what that plays in that.","And then the quick follow-up, if you don't mind, would just be we'd love to hear any comments on any differences between the national ad market and the local broadcast ad demand environment, if there's any differences there. And if there are any differences, maybe why difference in confidence between local and national or maybe the fact there's more digital substitutes for national advertisers?","Chase Carey","I think in the issue of how do we think about the platforms that are ad-free, I think in many ways, you go back in what I was \u2013 we talked about earlier is \u2013 we need to make sure however we distribute our product, we're getting fair value for it. And I think as we look at \u2013 and obviously, we can get value in two ways. We can get it in advertising or we can get it through subscription fees or license fees. And through those combination of factors, we need to make sure we get fair value that realistically get ad-free platform, it has more value than an ad-supported platform certainly at this point in time. And that value, whether it's subscription fees or license fees, should be reflected in it.","I think it\u2019s important for us to continue to figure out how do we evaluate and engage with all these plays, I mean Netflix and Amazon are ad-free platforms. We license our product to it \u2013 to them. We think we get compensated. And I think it's important for us to be disciplined in our license fees to get compensated for an amount that recognizes that product is going to be displayed ad-free.","I think in a larger context, we \u2013 I talked about the fact that consumers are clearly going to have more control over the experience and more choice over the experience going forward. We want to give those consumers \u2013 we want to find ways to give those consumers choices. Those choices just should be fairly valued. So if that means accessing content on platforms that don't have advertising then we need to get compensated through the payments that exist. If it's a dual revenue platform, we get compensated in a different way.","So I don't think we want to \u2013 I don't think it \u2013 we'll look at it and say we're going to try and discipline the world to say every platform has to be an ad-supported platform. I think there are ways we can get properly compensated in value if it is a platform that doesn't have advertising.","John Nallen","National versus local.","Chase Carey","National versus local, I mean there are always differences. Some of it, I wouldn't say they're dramatic differences, I mean certainly right now, you have different political swings locally where in some places you had politics playing up a large role and in other places, a very limited role, national side of that clearly being different. I think different advertising sectors probably buying a bit, given I think there's some advertising sectors, electronics and the like that are more geared to national buying than local buying. And I wouldn't say they are dramatically different \u2013 dramatic differences today between sort of the national side and the local side.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from John Janedis with Jefferies LLC.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Chase, this seems like an ad market where more than usual there may be some haves and have-nots. And I just wanted to ask, given your rights, is there any evidence sports programming is taking more share maybe at the expense of general entertainment networks or your mouse [ph] skewing cable networks? And then more broadly, what are you seeing from the auto category?","Chase Carey","I mean, I think it's certainly true that strong programming is doing better. As I said, I think whether it's \u2013 clearly, we see it in the strength in the NFL, which has done well. You look at our cable networks, which have competed well. I think, whether it's FOX News, or FX or the RSNs, all had strong \u2013 and that's a mix of entertainment and sports product, all competitively did well. We had in each of our core cable networks, we saw advertising growth. So I do think clearly strong unique programming in sports is the most obvious example. I mean some of it's just got the ratings hold up better, you have less fragmentation, the live nature of sports does enable to stand up \u2013 to stand up on its ratings. I think the NFL, we're pretty close to flat year-on-year at this point with the NFL season. So the strength of sports programming, I think, in many ways certainly positions it well for these marketplaces. But I think it is generally true that sort of successful programming will do better, and I think that's going to be in many ways an increasing part of the story.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Anything on auto?","Chase Carey","On the auto category? The auto category, probably today is one of those that has probably been a bit of a disappointment. Auto sales have been great and yet it seems to be a place where the auto advertisers are \u2013 certainly, year-on-year, the category is down and they're keeping \u2013 it seems like they're keeping more of the money in their pocket. Hopefully, some of it comes back into the market, maybe with fresh budgets or the fall, but \u2013 or the holiday season, but the auto category for the strength of the auto market, maybe there's \u2013 it's not been a strong category year-on-year.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital.","Daniel Salmon \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Chase, just to go back a little bit to the ratings question. As some of those improvements start to roll out, particularly around mobile measurement, which Nielsen has been very visible on lately, we've been hearing a little bit about network ad sales folks trying to figure out whether they want those rolled into the regular TV ratings, and I think a lot of this has to do with rates of monetization on digital and mobile versus traditional linear. Could you give us a little bit of color around how you guys are viewing that as these improvements come along, how you expect to roll them into how you're selling? And then just a quick one for John, you mentioned programming cancellation costs at FOX this quarter. Should we expect \u2013 FOX broadcast rather, should we expect a little bit of that to continue with some other recent news around cancellations there in this coming quarter?","Chase Carey","I think that's an issue that realistically we are very much in the midst of evaluating and analyzing and I think there's a real question as you get these digital platforms where, again, consumers have more control, what's the right way to approach it and are you better off with sort of premium advertising with more capabilities that may have less volume than \u2013 linear I think there's a honest argument to sort of say you look at the ad load that exists in our traditional business and it's pretty heavy. And clearly, I think one of the things that makes the DVR appealing is the ability to not just control what you want, find what you want, but to manage your time in terms of the advertising that's there.","And so I think there is a question of do we \u2013 are we better off getting premium dollars by creating different opportunities for advertisers and different experiences for consumers? And people have these studies sort of saying you can watch a large ad break or you can watch a short ad break and at the end of it, interact with \u2013 answer a bunch of questions about product. That's a way to create a different \u2013 and then just one example, but there are array of examples that we can use to try to create different experiences for consumers that would monetize this in new and different ways.","John Nallen","And Dan, to follow up on your question, yes, clearly, we made announcements in the last few days around programming that we're shortening or cancelling. So we'll absorb the cost of that in the quarter, but that's reflected in the guidance that we put together.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup","Question for Mr. Carey. In your prepared remarks, you suggested there may be opportunities to engage the consumer more directly via OTT offers. Assuming that Hulu is part of that mix, can you elaborate on what changes you'd like to see occur at Hulu to make it more relevant relative to some of its competitors?","Chase Carey","I guess what I really mean is \u2013 I mean, the more you understand what the consumer wants to watch and what they like and obviously, gives us a lot of insight into creating a better experience. And whether that's programming or trying to suggest choices or even down to what sort of advertising and promotional messages are relevant to them, is all part of it. Certainly, one of the attractions with Hulu is it is the leading digital platform we have today that through which we're only obviously a part owner, but we have an opportunity to directly engage with the consumer, and there's no question the more we are able to directly engage with the consumer, understand the consumer, develop data and information about what that consumer likes and is interested and wants to do, the more we think we can make that a rewarding experience for the consumer and one in which we can create value out of it with our array of partners.","So I do think we think the ability to participate more directly with the consumer, whether it's Hulu or others, and develop a much better understanding of our consumers and the type of databases we were talking about a few minutes ago and information and capabilities. Certainly with Hulu, we have a vehicle that's able to do ad targeting that doesn't require third parties. We're not sort of a step removed from the process of creating targeted ads. We can directly create a platform that enables us to target ads to the consumers in Hulu and that opportunity certainly exists in other over-the-top platforms.","John Nallen","Thank you, Jason. Operator, at this time we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you sir and that will come from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Partners.","Michael Morris \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","A couple of questions on regional sports networks. Earlier today, DISH spoke about RSNs as being somewhat more at risk in an environment where consumers have more selection over the types of packages that they buy. At the same time, they were positive on Disney, which, of course, is very exposed to national sports network in their business model. So I guess I have two questions. First, when you look at your existing agreements or you look over the next couple of years, how much risk is there at your regional sports networks of your distribution partners, moving your networks to different tiers perhaps that aren't as broadly distributed? Are you able to protect yourself from that type of shift in offering?","And second of all, just given that you do have exposure to both regional sports networks and a national sports networks, can you talk about the affinity for the regional sports networks versus the national sports networks and whether it makes sense that a national sports network would be more valuable to the consumer, to a distributor than the regional networks?","Chase Carey","I mean, first let me be clear our regional sports business \u2013 regional sports network business for us is a great business. It has been one of the most successful and probably as important as any business we've had in many ways, has and continues to be, a real area of growth. And I think the reason is clear, at the end of the day, David Hill used to say that \"sports are tribal\", which ultimately means local. Local sports are the heart, in many ways, of what makes a community tick. We think these regional sports networks are great businesses. I think we've proven the ability to manage it. I think the fact that we have a breadth and depth of not just regional sports networks helps distinguish us from others in the business, but the fact that the regional sports networks are part of a broader portfolio of sports that cut across national networks and the broadcast network, truly enables us to create really clearly distinctive and unique opportunities for consumers to engage with sports across the board. We think this sports programming is going to get nothing but more important and more valuable in a digital world and we realistically feel great about it.","I mean, I guess, I didn't see the DISH comment. I guess, it shouldn't be lost that they have a deal with Disney so I guess sort of saying \u2013 defending the reasons for doing a deal after you've already done a deal is probably a bit sort of self-justification as opposed to rationalizing something upfront. But we feel great about the regional sports networks in terms of value. Obviously I don't think you can generalize. Not every regional is the same and, obviously, not every national sports network is the same. Our national sports network continues to increase in value as we've added key rights to it. We think it is uniquely attractive to a large segment of consumers out there in many ways, must-have programming, when you look at the breadth of content that's going to exist from sort of baseball to NASCAR to soccer, to the UFC to golf to college sports, basketball, football. Uniquely important, we will value it fairly and accordingly.","The regionals have played a different role in each of their local communities. And we feel very good about the future of each and we feel \u2013 while there's some linkage, clearly, I think as a whole, it makes us stronger, I think it is a one plus one is three to have the breadth of sports we have across the Fox Network, the FOX national sports networks and the regional sports networks. Each at the end of the day, while they are part of a larger whole, each appropriately stands on its own two feet. And we continue to be excited about it. And again, I think our track record in continuing to build them speaks for itself.","Michael Morris \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","And on the question of if there's risk of perhaps more tiering of the regional sports networks relative to where they are right now, is that a legitimate concern within the agreements or are you somewhat protected from --","Chase Carey","It's not how we built these businesses. I mean, it's not how we built the businesses. We've done deals as recently as the last month and certainly that's not where we're going. If you\u2019ve tiered these, they'd have a completely different cost and you'd have completely different proposition. It would be a very different consumer proposition and you'd be disenfranchising and in many ways obviously, it would cost a lot more if you tiered it and you'd be disenfranchising in many ways consumers who would say that's the most important programming in the bundle I've been buying.","And that has not been again how we built it, and it's not the base around the business \u2013 the model around which we've continued to build it, and we continue to engage with our distributors and continue to build \u2013 we think this bundle as a whole, again, has real great value for the consumer to the degree you have noise around it. I think sports is a critical part of that bundle. I think if you started to unbundle things, you may well find the consumers wish for the days of the bundle that the real \u2013 the best value proposition for them is the ability to buy a breadth and choice of programming that includes sports. And that is certainly the path along which we continue to build our businesses.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we\u2019ll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before giving comments on the quarter\u2019s results, I\u2019ll take just a minute to provide an update on the two transactions we announced at the end of 2017. But first, we want to note recent press reports about the potential of a further offer for our businesses. Consistent with past practice, we are not going to comment on market speculation.","And regarding our agreement with Disney, we jointly filed a preliminary proxy three weeks ago. It is a detailed filing that should answer any questions people have about this transaction. Once finalized and cleared by the SEC, we anticipate being in a position this summer to request shareholder approval for both the merger with Disney and the creation of New Fox.","Planning for New Fox is well underway and we\u2019ll keep you posted on our progress, including announcements on the new company\u2019s leadership team and organizational structure. In the meantime, we are making strategic investments such as the addition of key sports markets through our acquisition of 7 Sinclair stations announced this morning and our deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football that will deliver New Fox the very best content available.","Now let me provide some highlights on the company\u2019s performance this past quarter. A couple of things really stand out. First and foremost, the earnings power of our Cable Networks. This segment delivered 16% growth and its highest EBITDA quarter ever. While John will provide more detail from the financials, much of this strength was driven by continued double-digit affiliate revenue growth at both our domestic and international channels businesses. This growth reflects the strength of our video brands to distributors and audiences. Cumulative domestic subscribers grew year-over-year, driven by subscriber gains at our younger channels as well as the continued ramp in new virtual MVPD subscriptions.","We saw continued strength in sports and news, demonstrating the competitive advantage of our outstanding brands and content that are primarily viewed live. The Fox News Channel achieved its highest quarterly EBITDA in its history. Its younger sibling, Fox Business Network, beat its competition in viewership for the sixth consecutive quarter.","Our domestic cable sports networks were also major drivers of profitability with our local RSN and national sports networks, FOX Sports 1 and FOX Sports 2, generating double-digit earnings growth. The RSN saw higher viewership this past NBA season and ratings for the new Major League Baseball season are up as well.","We also delivered creatively, generating long-term value to the standout entertainment content we produce and monetize. At our Broadcast Network, new hits, 911 and The Resident; and strong returning shows, Empire and STAR, drove growth in season-to-date total audience over a year ago. This coming Monday, we will announce next season\u2019s schedule at our upfront presentation and we could be not more excited by the lineup.","At FX, we had a successful run with the second installment of the American Crime Story saga, The Assassination Of Gianni Versace, and the current seasons of Atlanta and the final installment of The Americans are each performing well.","Our film studio had a great setup for the quarter with holiday releases that continued to deliver at the box office supported by industry-leading awards recognition. These include The Greatest Showman; Three Billboards; and the Oscar Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water. The home entertainment release of these films, along with the theatrical release of Deadpool 2 next week, should propel a strong film fourth fiscal quarter.","Ultimately, it is our consistent long-term investment in creative content that has propelled this company and made it unique. This quarter\u2019s results demonstrate the success of that strategy and its ability to continue to create growth and value accretion for shareholders. John?","John Nallen","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. At the start, I\u2019ll remind you that this quarter, we\u2019re comping against our broadcast of the Super Bowl a year ago, which contributed about $425 million of net revenues and approximately $100 million of EBITDA in our Television segment. That said, the current underlying trends across our businesses reflect good progress toward our financial goals as reflected in this quarter\u2019s results.","So for this third quarter, total company revenues were $7.4 billion, down $144 million compared to a year ago. Ex the Super Bowl impact, revenues grew 4% over the prior year, reflecting double-digit increases at our Cable Network segment, being partially offset by lower Television segment revenues.","Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.89 billion, a 2% reduction from a year ago. Included in this quarter\u2019s results is an approximate $60 million charge, which is reflected in the Other segment, which reflects the modification of stock compensation expense related to the proposed Disney transaction. So absent last year\u2019s Super Bowl contribution and the stock compensation charge this year, quarterly EBITDA grew 6%, paced by double-digit growth at the Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower results of the Film segment.","From a bottom line perspective, reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $876 million or $0.47 per share increased from the $0.44 per share reported in the prior year. Adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $0.49 versus a comparable $0.54 in the prior year. However, this year\u2019s adjusted results of $0.49 includes a $0.02 per share charge from that transaction-related stock comp expense that I just referred to. Additionally, our share of increased Hulu losses negatively impacted this year\u2019s earnings by $0.04 per share.","So now turning to the performance at our operating segments. The Cable Network segment\u2019s EBITDA was $1.68 billion, up 16% on revenue growth of 10% and expense growth of 6%. Domestic cable revenues increased 10% overall, led by affiliate fee growth of 10%, which was supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued subscriber growth at our expanding networks. Ad revenue increased 3%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News, partially offset by fewer episodes of original series at FX.","EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 15% over the prior year from the strong growth across our entire portfolio of brands. You should note that sublicensing of Big Ten rights this quarter increased domestic cable revenue growth by 3 percentage points and expense growth by 5 percentage points with no effect on earnings.","Reported international cable revenues grew 9%, led by a 14% increase in affiliate revenue. International advertising revenues were about level with last year as continued growth at STAR entertainment and the international channels were offset by the impact of substantially reduced cricket matches on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA increased 23%, led by a more than doubling of contributions at STAR TV.","In our Television segment, EBITDA was $78 million, 59% below last year and principally reflects the absence of contributions from last year\u2019s Super Bowl. Separately, lower NFL results this year from the ad revenue impact of reduced postseason ratings and three fewer games than last year were offset by higher contributions from double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth and improved entertainment results.","At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $286 million was $87 million below last year, primarily reflecting lower TV production contributions owing to a substantial increase in the number of new first year drama series delivered and their related deficits as well as the absence of the prior year SVOD licensing of American Crime Story.","Additionally, the current quarter includes a loss of approximately $20 million supporting the release of Marvel Strike Force, the first game produced by our new mobile game studio, FoxNext. We are encouraged by this inaugural release. And as we continue to build out this business, we expect the aggregate investment in support of its future growth to approximate $100 million in this fiscal year.","At the film studio, results were in line with last year and included the successful performance of our holiday movie film slate carrying into the third quarter, led by The Greatest Showman, Three Billboards and The Shape of Water.","And lastly, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and $20 billion in debt, with our capital allocation priority remaining focused on the Sky acquisition.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. With three quarters behind us in the fiscal year, we\u2019ve made considerable progress on a lot of different fronts and we feel that the business is in very good health. As Lachlan and John said, we\u2019re focused on moving all of our businesses forward: driving improvements in the viewer experience; making our content more available, not less, both inside and outside the home; and pushing ourselves creatively to build long-term value with our IP while driving up the value of our overarching video brands; and, more importantly, creating a more engaged advertising experience.","For example, over the last several months, we renewed a number of important RSN partnerships. We\u2019re readying the direct-to-consumer Fox News products and have developed a strong number of pilots and scheduling for the next broadcast season. In addition, we\u2019re making great progress internationally. In the Indian TV business, our entertainment channels achieved significant regional market share growth over the past year in two of the largest regions while launching the number 1 national free-to-air channel in the country, Star Bharat.","Our sports channels are growing at a fast clip, including driving massive scale of our mobile platform, Hotstar, which saw its reach exceed 140 million in the month of April and is currently showing more than 2.5x growth in IPL watch time over last year. Overall, Hotstar continues to thrive as the go-to digital video platform and is now seeing 1 billion minutes of daily watch time regularly. To put Hotstar\u2019s scale into perspective, we had 7 million concurrent live streams during a single IPL match this season, which is likely the highest ever for a sporting event on a streaming service in the world.","We\u2019re very comfortable that we\u2019ll hit our $500 million EBITDA target at STAR TV. We had decided, however, from the strong quarter in the year, to continue to increase our investment in Hotstar, which for the year, will be about $50 million. As we proved with the IPL, leveraging standout sports with strategy, we\u2019ve demonstrated time and again that it can drive strong returns for the business. And we expect no less from recent investments in other sports rights such as the NFL\u2019s Thursday Night Football or the recently acquired extension of the BCCI rights in India.","Turning now to Sky, which recently reported strong results. The group continues to see strong demand for its products and services with the continued development and rollout of Sky Q in millions of homes across the UK, Ireland, Italy and, as of this week, Germany.","Now as the founding shareholder of Sky, we remain committed to our bid to buy the remaining Sky shares we do not own and expect to receive UK regulatory approval in a month or two. Comcast has just begun its regulatory process and we think it\u2019s very reasonable for Comcast to undergo a robust regulatory review, which could take months. The Comcast review would be appropriate given the important role Sky and Sky News play in the UK media market. Given Comcast\u2019s fit for Sky, we\u2019re considering our options, with a further announcement to be made in due course. While we\u2019re obviously focused on a number of important transactions ahead of us, we\u2019re no less focused on driving all of our businesses forward.","And with that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Reed Nolte","Hi, Ryan. We\u2019d be happy to take questions from the investment community if you could tee it up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Rich Greenfield","Hi, thanks for taking the question. We have a lot of investors wondering, is the Disney Fox transaction the only one you\u2019ll consider? Or are you still open to competing offers from third parties? And then I just have a quick follow-up.","Lachlan Murdoch","Rich, it\u2019s Lachlan. As I said in my opening comments, we\u2019re not going to kind of engage in a lot of speculation around this, but I can say that we are committed to our agreement with Disney and are working through the conditions to bring it to closing. In addition, our directors, though, of course, are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.","Rich Greenfield","Okay. In the Disney proxy, it made it pretty clear that you preferred both the Disney currency over competing stock offers and that you also needed a significant break fee or the break fee it seemed was very important to protect Fox and its shareholders from the perceived regulatory risk. If \u2013 as you said, if the board that you just mentioned at least have the fiduciary duty to listen to other offers, would you have interest in an all-cash offer with significant regulatory protections? Or is Fox only interested in stock deals at this point?","Lachlan Murdoch","We\u2019re not \u2013 yes.","James Murdoch","Rich, it\u2019s James here. I think \u2013 yes. I think I just want to reiterate here, the directors are very aware of their responsibilities.","Rich Greenfield","So cash is certainly on the table?","James Murdoch","Look, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to comment further on what Lachlan said, I think pretty succinctly and very clearly.","Rich Greenfield","Thank you very much.","Reed Nolte","Thanks, Rich. Operator, next question please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Jessica Reif with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif","Thank you. I\u2019m curious what your comfort level is with leverage, whether you need more cash for Sky or other assets like the TV acquisition you announced today? And then, secondly, can you talk about how your upfront approach will change? I mean, as you guys said, your presentation\u2019s next Monday, so it\u2019s right around the corner. Will you sell on a unified basis? Or will you split the approach between Broadcast and Cable, given the pending transaction?","John Nallen","Jessica, it\u2019s John...","Jessica Reif","I guess, we can start leverage and I\u2019ll talk to the upfront.","John Nallen","Yes. So it\u2019s John. I\u2019ll start with the leverage question. I think you know us well enough that we operate our balance sheet in a very conservative way. We take pride in our solid investment grade rating and any actions we take, we\u2019ll have that in mind and we\u2019ll look to retain that. So I don\u2019t think you should expect us to really change our leverage profile dramatically.","Lachlan Murdoch","And then, Jessica, on the upfront here, we couldn\u2019t be more excited going into Monday with the schedule that we\u2019ve put together. I think last year, we coined the term and made the comment that Fox would own the fall, particularly with the strength of our then very strong football, but also Major League Baseball and postseason. This year, we\u2019re going in reverse in our football so we\u2019ll be in an even stronger and more enviable position. And as I said, the schedule, which is just being finalized now, couldn\u2019t be stronger and I think we\u2019ll have a tremendous autumn. We will be selling as we have in past years aggregate across both the Broadcast network and the Cable assets as well.","Jessica Reif","Can I just follow up then? Is there any change in your operational focus in the interim period like away from direct-to-consumer or toward something else?","James Murdoch","Jessica, we\u2019re operating the business to drive it forward. I mean, look, a regulatory process that is unfolding with respect to these transactions. And in the meantime, we\u2019re running the business on a business-as-usual basis in terms of focusing on the velocity of doing, focusing on new product development as well as executing across the world in what\u2019s, as you know, a pretty diverse and dynamic business. So there\u2019s no shift in what we\u2019ve been doing vis-\u00e0-vis these transactions, if that\u2019s what you mean.","Jessica Reif","Great, okay. Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Moffett. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I have two. First one\u2019s on the 7 stations you acquired. I know you won\u2019t give me the actual retransmission rates of those stations versus where we are now, but can you talk a bit about the magnitude gap between the stations you acquire and how you monetize around a station\u2019s retrans? And then how quickly can you turn that retrans money on after acquisition?","And then, secondly, on cord-cutting, we spent most of the past three years worrying about cord-cutting. You\u2019re now at a point where you\u2019re seeing increasing growth in subs. Can you talk a bit about how big the virtual businesses is for you in terms of sales coming from virtual MVPDs? Any idea where the subs are coming from?","Lachlan Murdoch","Look, I\u2019ll start with just the stations and, again \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail around the \u2013 our retransmission agreements and affiliation agreements. But the purchase multiple of these stations, when you add in what is effectively an automatic step up in retransmission, means that we\u2019re buying stations at about a 7.5 multiple and that will drive \u2013 it will add about $350 million of revenue to the station group and about $112 million of EBITDA through that.","James Murdoch","Yes. And Michael, with respect to the kind of \u2013 the pay TV universe domestically in the U.S., I think we\u2019re seeing very strong growth, as we said last quarter, around digital MVPDs, these new entrants. And I know \u2013 I mean, you say over the last three years, you\u2019ve been worried about these declines. I think you will know that we always thought that the increase in downstream competition would actually expand the market and the growth in subscribers from new entrants would actually be able to drive volume in the business while our \u2013 increasing our ability to monetize our rates due to the strength of our brands and our investment in the content would also kind of compound. That\u2019s why you see another quarter of double-digit growth in terms of our affiliate revenue.","At this point, so this is a little bit after the close of the quarter, we\u2019re over \u2013 we were seeing over 4 million, a good bit over 4 million digital MVPD customers in that kind of universe. And I would say, from what we can tell, the cable deterioration is not as fast as the DBS in telco. Deterioration of a subscriber base and how much of that is shifting to digital MVPD and how much is new customers in the market, I think it\u2019s split. We are also seeing a lot of the so-called cord nevers, acquiring really attractive bundles from the new entrants, particularly YouTube TV and Hulu Live, which continue to grow really well. So we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the affiliate universe. And I think it just goes to show that new competition and lower barriers to entry is what drives real innovation for customers and that competition can expand the overall marketplace. We would expect it to continue.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks, James. Thanks a lot for that.","Reed Nolte","Thank you. Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Stephen Cahall with Royal Bank. Please go ahead.","Stephen Cahall","Yes, thanks. Maybe first, on Fox News, it sounds like pricing is really strong there. I know we\u2019re in a tough comp period. So I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of do you expect ad revenue to accelerate as we enter the midterm election season in the back half of the calendar year. And as you launch direct-to-consumer, if you could give us any indication of how CPMs compare on that versus linear and how much of that will be dynamically advertised?","And then secondly, I think you announced one of these stations you\u2019re acquiring is a CW affiliate in Miami. That\u2019s a pretty big NFL market. Would you expect to keep that as a CW? Or is there an opportunity to convert that into a Fox affiliate over time? Thanks.","Lachlan Murdoch","Steven, first let me deal with the end first. In Miami, we\u2019re not going to announce some \u2013 any plans for that CW station yet. We\u2019re looking forward to getting hold of it and we expect this transaction to close with Sinclair in probably six months to nine months. So there\u2019s time to work on that, but we\u2019re not making any announcements of any affiliation changes today.","In terms of the Fox News comp, I think one of the importance things to mention is, as you said, the comp is difficult with \u2013 when you compare them to a year ago, so the first 100 days of this presidency and what were incredibly record-breaking ratings. I should say though, however, that if you look April to April, so actually just outside of this quarter we\u2019re reporting, last April was the last month where Bill O\u2019Reilly was leading our primetime before he left the channel. And if you look April to April, we\u2019ve held our ratings incredibly well. We\u2019re basically flat with last year. And I think that\u2019s a real testament to the strength of the brand and, obviously, the strength of the talent on air. So we feel very strongly about that.","In terms of D2C, obviously, the advertising on the D2C platform when we launched it, we expect to be able to drive significantly higher CPMs.","John Nallen","And Steven, it\u2019s John. To your question about local races and the impact, that impact will most notably be felt by us at the stations where we\u2019re over-indexing in the amount of races that are in our existing stations. So it will be much more positive there than on Fox News, although Fox News should enjoy some of it as well.","Stephen Cahall","Thanks.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Steve. Operator, we have time for one more \u2013 one last question.","Operator","Okay. And that question will come from the line of Alan Gould with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Alan Gould","Thank you. John, I was wondering, could you give \u2013 can you break out a little bit the results of the Cable operations in RemainCo versus the Cable operations in New Fox?","John Nallen","Alan, we\u2019re not...","Alan Gould","Could you give some color on it?","John Nallen","Yes. At this point, we\u2019re not going to separate out the companies. As we look toward getting closer to a closing and the filing of the Form 10 of New Fox, which is probably in the fall, that\u2019s about the time that we\u2019ll start to separately report on that.","Alan Gould","Okay, thank you.","Reed Nolte","Great. Thanks, Alan. Thank you, everybody, for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions, please give Mike Petrie or me a call. Thanks.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, everyone. Have a good day.","Lachlan Murdoch","Yes. Thanks, everyone. All the best.","Operator","Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, as you heard, that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder today's call will be recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours, please go ahead. ","Reed Nolte ","Thank you very much, Steve. Hello, everyone and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to 21st Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The Company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2013 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income, before depreciation and amortization often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","Also note that the historical results for periods prior to June 28, 2013 described in the press release and on this call have been adjusted to reflect the separation that was completed at the end of fiscal 2013. ","With that, I'm pleased to turn it over to John.","John Nallen ","Thanks Reed, and good morning, everyone. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, our financial results continue to reflect strong top-line revenue growth. We reported second quarter fiscal 2014 revenues for the total company of $8.2 billion, which is up 15% compared to the second quarter a year ago. Approximately 40% of this growth is organic with the balance reflecting the inclusion of revenues from our newly consolidated business namely Sky Deutschland and our acquired cable sports channels.","Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.54 billion, a 4% reduction compared to the $1.61 billion reported a year ago. This year's results reflect solid underlying cable channel growth, continued strength in retransmission consent revenues and a strong TV production performance. These increases were more than offset by lower contributions from our film business and weaker ratings for the X Factor, as well as the impact of the investments in our new cable channels and the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's EBITDA losses.","In aggregate, the impact of acquisitions and new channel launches reduced our reported EBITDA growth by approximately 6%. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the growth by a further 1%. From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $982 million as compared to $1.06 billion reported in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding the net income effects in both years of amounts reflected in other net and our gains from participating in BSkyB's share repurchase program, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.33 this year versus $0.35 in the prior year.","Now let me provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses and let's start with the Cable Networks. Overall, total segment revenues in the second quarter increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 17% increase in affiliate revenues and 7% advertising growth. The 17% affiliate revenue growth was led by higher rates across our channels. Domestic affiliate fees increased 15%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX, and Fox News, as well as our new channels FS1 and FXX. Increased revenues related to the impact of last year's NHL lockout and the inclusion of Sports Time Ohio also contributed to the growth.","Our reported international affiliate fees were up 22%. Within this overall increase, affiliate fees at the non-sports channels at FIC and STAR grew 16% in local currency terms. The balance of the affiliate fee increase was from the international sports channel, which was partially offset by unfavorable currency movements. Second quarter advertising revenue growth reflects domestic advertising increases of 7%, led by double-digit gains at the FX channels and the RSNs, which were partially offset by political related advertising declines at Fox News. ","At the international channels, advertising revenue increased 9%. Within this overall increase, local currency advertising at the FIC and STAR non-sports channels grew at the same 9% rate. The increase generated by our sports channels was offset by the overall negative impact of foreign currency. So, total Cable segment EBITDA in the quarter was $1.04 billion, a 2% increase above prior-year levels.","Similar to our first quarter results, this quarter's strong underlying EBITDA growth generated by the RSNs, FX and Fox International channels was largely absorbed by the impact of a planned investments in our new channel launches and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency comparisons. Combined the new channels and currency negatively impacted the year-on-year Cable segment growth by 10% with the new channel launches alone representing a 7% impact to our growth.","Turning to our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $218 million declined $27 million from last year. We had strong growth in the retransmission consent revenues and improved network sports results led by the revenue increases from solid ratings to the NFL regular season and the MLB post season. These improvements were more than offset by substantially reduced political revenues at the stations, weaker X Factor ratings, and higher programming and marketing costs at the Fox Network in support of our initiative to invest in new network.","At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $337 million, down 21% from a year ago. This decline primarily reflects lower theatrical revenues and higher releasing costs for this year's films, including the Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Walking with Dinosaurs and The Counselor as well as difficult comparisons to last year's results, which included the theatrical release of Taken 2 and the home entertainment release of Ice Age - Continental Drift. Revenues and EBITDA contributions at our television production units were up year-over-year, primarily due to this year's domestic syndication of modern family and higher SVOD revenues.","Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $30 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million in the prior year. This decrease reflects the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's negative EBITDA results, which more than offset a $25 million improvement in SKY Italia contributions, primarily for marketing and operating cost reductions. Total revenues at the DBS segment increased by $605 million, principally from the inclusion of $565 million in Sky Deutschland revenue. Sky D this morning reported ARPU gains of 5.5% and a year-over-year direct subscriber increase of 304,000, yielding 3.67 million subs at quarter end.","At SKY Italia, local currency revenues in the quarter were similar to a year ago as a slight ARPU increase was offset by lower average subs for the period. Quarter-end subscribers of 4.76 million were unchanged from the end of September. Now before I turn to guidance, let me give you a quick update on our buyback activity and the delisting process. Since the date of the separation, we have been consistently repurchasing FOXA shares, resulting in approximately $2.3 billion of repurchases from July 1 through yesterday. So, we're on track to complete the $4 billion buyback within the 12 month timeframe we previously announced.","Additionally, in the beginning January, we announced our plans to delist form the Australian Stock Exchange. Yesterday, we filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC that includes detailed information about the delisting process and key dates. If approved, the effective date of the suspension in trading on the ASX will occur at the close of trading on May 1. Finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2014 total segment EBITDA growth. Since our last earnings call three months ago, we've updated our operational assumptions to reflect our first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. ","And while we have usual pluses and minuses across most of our divisions that essentially offset, we are lowering our outlook in two areas. First, our Film division's results for the six months have been below our plans, including the impact of our three theatrical film releases in the December quarter and this will impact our full year outlook. Second, primetime ratings and therefore advertising revenues will be lower than anticipated at the Fox Broadcast Network, largely due to the mixed performance of our shows led by the lower than planned ratings on the X Factor and the early results of American Idol. Therefore these network advertising revenue factors will also impact our full year outlook. ","So, primarily as a result of these film and network factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2014 will be in the mid to high single-digit range, above the $6.26 billion at a total segment EBITDA base level of fiscal 2013. This outlook does not reflect the impact of consolidating the YES Network results, although this factor would not materially impact the 2014 growth rate. If that transaction closes when expected, we will consolidate the YES Network results beginning in our fiscal fourth-quarter, including approximately $1.7 billion of their debt.","As we look out to our expected performance for the second half of the year, we anticipate that a majority of our overall annual growth will be realized in the fourth fiscal quarter, as we expect very favorable film comparisons led by this year's comparatively stronger releases, including Rio 2 and X-Men; Days of Future Past.","Additionally, results of the Cable segment are expected to be strong, driven by continued top-line growth and a more moderate increase in costs, principally from sports rights. ","So with that, let me turn the call over to Chase.","Chase Carey ","Thank you, John and good morning everybody. This may sound like an unexpected opening line after John just took our guidance down a notch, but we've never been more excited about the future at 21st Century Fox. Let me be clear that I'm not minimizing our disappointment in the adjusted guidance. However that disappointment is not distract from the momentum that exists across the Company and the confidence in our ability to achieve the overall three-year goals we outlined last August.","Structurally and strategically, we've never been stronger and better positioned. We continue to build the foundation that will enable us to deliver sustained long-term growth. At our cable channels that foundation begins with long-term affiliation agreements that drives stable top-line growth and provide the base to build new channels like Fox Sports 1, FXX and our new sports international channels.","We continue to conclude agreements around the world that meet or exceed our targets for both existing and new channels, which reflect our global strength. In the last few months, we concluded such agreements with two of the top 10 U.S. distributors, as well as leading distributors in Latin America and Asia. ","We also continue to take advantage of opportunities to add new dimensions to our Cable business. Last month we agreed to increase our ownership in YES to 80% and we've recently rebranded multiple channels in Latin America and Europe building a global lifestyle brand called Fox Life, which creates an additional international tent-pole brand to go with Fox, Fox Sports and National Geographic.","Other foundation to drive our long-term growth is our unique brands content and long-term rights that distinguish our business. Our U.S. channels continue to maximize these strengths and build on our market leadership positions. At FX, American Horror Story had a great run with its best ratings ever. Sons of Anarchy finished its season as the highest rated series in FX history.","We also look forward to FX's launch of Season 2 of The Americans later this month and the premier of new series like Tyrant from the creators of Homeland and The Strain, both of which will premiere this summer. Our RSNs continue to deliver on-target results and we're well-positioned in the rights discussions. ","FOX News, which is dominant ratings for us as ever, although headwinds in the ad markets during this off-political cycle have been tougher than expected leading to results that are up year-on-year, but behind our targets. Fortunately, we're headed back into another political cycle and recent programming moves are delivering even stronger ratings.","At Fox Business, we're excited to welcome Maria Bartiromo and look forward to ongoing growth and profits with new and improved distribution agreements on top of ongoing improvements at the channel. We're still investing in building FOX Sports 1 and FXX, while going through some of the growing pains of building a programming line-up that those channels are on course and will be a source of new profits for years to come.","An issue that has been a topic of recent debate is the impact of consolidation in the U.S. distribution industry. We honestly don't see any material consequences to our business, in fact there may be some positive ones. First, unique content at scale and expanding digital world has never held a stronger hand. Second, new digital platforms and over the top players may grow even more quickly with the consolidated distribution industry.","Furthermore, the real issue is how many choices an individual home has, not how big is the distributor. We already deal successfully with large distributors. Cable consolidation will not change the number of choices. Consumer choice is actually likely to increase not decrease as over the top digital platforms emerge. Finally, consolidation may spur innovation and improved customer experience and new technologies like targeted ads, as well as other enhancements that enlarge the pie for everyone."," ","Turning back to our channels business, another foundation for our long-term growth is our international leadership position. Although we expect that the continued weakening of emerging market currencies will adversely impact this year's Cable results by an additional $50 million to $75 million from what we assumed at the start of the fiscal year. Our operational progress internationally, including at both Fox International channels and STAR continues to be a story of across-the-board strength, while adding new dimensions to the business.","STAR recently launched the STAR Sports brand across its six sports channel including STAR Sports 3, India's 24x7 Hindi sports channel and the digital sites starsports.com substantially increasing the reach of sports and establishing a new foundation for growth in India. Although related investments are stemming our short-term profit, this initiative should prove to be one of our largest drivers of growth five and ten years from now."," ","On the broadcast side of channels business, we've had mixed results. Sports has been a positive, particularly the NFL capped by Sunday Super Bowl delivering TVs largest audience ever. Retransmission is also an ongoing source of growth that we continue to conclude agreements at or above our targets. The one area that is delivering results significantly below expectations is the Entertainment Network.","While we had success with new series we'd be following Golden Globe winner Brooklyn-Nine Nine, accommodation and disappointing ratings from X Factor, larger programming right has been planned, and a bit of extra programming and marketing costs leave us well behind our goal.","We also expect American Idol, which is a much better show than it was a year ago to deliver results below our targets. While these results are disappointing, we're quite bullish about the direction of the network as we break away from decades-old antiquated rules of broadcasting or hundred scripts in the fall become 20 pilots in the spring leading the dozens of series being launched that September with each planned to deliver 22 episodes before the cycle begins again.","During the coming months, our new strategy for the network will start to evolve with events like 24 and Cosmos, as well as new series like Gracepoint and Hieroglyph. All launched at different times of the year, different series lengths and new programs ordered without pilot that goes straight to series.","We still rely on some of the historical industry practices where it makes sense. However, we can't be bound by rules established in a three network world. We need to execute with an opportunistic agility to maximize its value. Our broadcast network is the strongest distribution platform in the business and this new direction will enable us to build it to its full potential. Our content business is also one with mixed results. Our television studio continues to be a powerhouse with 43 scripted shows on broadcast and Cable this season and 17 new pilots for next season. We're more excited than ever about the increasingly robust digital market for our product.","We just concluded a new agreement with Amazon granting exclusive SVOD writes to FX's hit shows Americans, as well as SVOD distribution rights to other new and library series. More details will come from Amazon later today on that. On the Flipside, our film company has had a difficult first half of the year. I don't want to try and put a silver lining on the results, we're disappointed. But with this business we'll always its ups and downs. We are energized about a number of key releases over the next six months, including Rio 2, X-Men \u2013 Days of Future Past and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.These results will have a big impact on fiscal 2014 due to the timing, but we're optimistic that it will provide a great start to next fiscal year.","Finally, our satellite platforms in the U.K., Germany, Italy and India continue to operate well in building their leadership positions. We're pleased with the recent subscriber addition at BSkyB and Sky Deutschland and have stabilized subscriber levels and profits in Italy.","So in aggregate, while we have some businesses that aren't delivering planned and short-term results, we feel good about the strategy and direction of all of our operations. Overall, we have solid momentum which gives us confidence in achieving our long-term targets.","With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.","Reed Nolte","Thanks you, Chase. Steve, now we'd like to move on to the Q&A part.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentleman we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Mike Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Mike Nathanson - MoffettNathanson Research","I have one for John and then one for Chase and James. John, could you just spend some time on Cable Networks. Expenses were up 22% in first half. I wonder when you look at this fiscal year, what you expect expense growth will be for -- given that's for the year, maybe you can separate the growth rates for the year between domestic and international expenses?","John Nallen","I'm not sure that I look at it that way, Michael. But I think the growth rate will be consistent as we go through it on the sports side, internationally. It's probably consistent growth rate and expenses we go through. On the U.S. side, the growth rate will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter as I indicated because the sports right costs particularly at FS1 are not as significant as they were or will be in first three quarters. So, there will be slight moderation in the fourth quarter, but I think the increase will be fairly consistent for the first three quarters of the year.","Mike Nathanson - MoffettNathanson Research","Then for Chase and James, you talked a bit Chase about changes in the broadcast model. One of the things we hear a lot about is VOD, because you guys are only network at a studio, there seems to be tension about VOD rights in terms giving of giving people MVPDs stacking rights for a whole season. So, how you feel about possibly change in the model to give four season stacking rights versus what it does to be back end of the value, just an indications or you guys are feeling about that change to the model.","Chase Carey","There is no question that increasingly, the value of these rights is -- extends beyond the linear networks and into the VOD world. I think each of those businesses, which is what we're doing needs to pursue a strategy that makes sense for them. So I think for our networks that's capturing and controlling a wider set of rights, variable to deliver an experience to their consumers that enables people to watch what they want, when they want, where they want. I think in order to do that the networks have to be aggressive about controlling and negotiating the rights they need. ","Negotiating those rights with our studio is really not they have been negotiating rights with third parties. I think equally on the content side, we recognize those rights have value, and we expect the content side to extract value for its rights in the marketplace. So, I think owning both sides enable us to have a strategic understanding of sort of the business as a whole, but I think the execution of that really condemned to each individual business pursuing what makes sense for it strategically, which on the network side is controlling a wider set of rights in a digital world, on the studio side is extracting appropriate value for its rights from distributors.","I think we have the benefit of visibility to both sides of that and hopefully makes smart decisions about how much we\u2019ll invest, how much we\u2019ll invest in the networks to control those rights on one hand and ensuring on the content side we\u2019re extracting fair and full value for those rights. As I think it has the benefit of strategic understanding of those, but the actual execution really comes out of both businesses, and making smart decisions.","Operator","As an additional housekeeping item and in interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Our next question will come from the line of John Janedis of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Janedis - UBS","John, there has been a lot of focus as you know on X Factor and Idol. Given the comments you made on the network and ad maintenance from ratings, does this change your view on the size of investments on scripted programming relative to prior expectations?","Chase Carey","No, I don\u2019t see anyone coming, I think, they are looking great shows. Clearly, the scripted entertainment area for us both the studio and the network as I said, this year we have the two new shows, we feel great about. Brooklyn Nine-Nine and the Sleepy Hollow, so certainly that\u2019s a great area for us, but equally we\u2019ve had great success over the years with non-scripted entertainment and actually we have some new executive in place to energize that area and actually he\u2019s got some great things coming out later in the year.","Look, I think it\u2019s important for us to continue to be opportunistic and open-minded in some ways continue to try to find new programming in whatever format that excites the people and energizes people. We think there are opportunities across the board and I don't \u2013 I think we got to continue to really try and find, and build that next hit franchise whether it\u2019s scripted or non-scripted, but it\u2019s \u2013 we certainly expect to be aggressive in both sides of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Nomura","Just wondering is the change in guidance has any bearing on your longer term guidance targets, if you could just talk about that $9 billion EBITDA number? Then Chase, just love an update on your thoughts on Aereo, as we go into Supreme Court ruling in June and July? Thanks.","Chase Carey","No, it really doesn't affect so that what I said \u2013 I think structurally, we feel good about where we're at. And again, I don't want to be clear that I'm not trying to just go out over the challenge that we\u2019ve got, they're really in a couple of businesses. In the film business, it is a business that has ups and down. We feel good about the films we\u2019ve got coming as we look forward. But it\u2019s not a structural. It\u2019s a film business, it\u2019s still \u2013 look we\u2019ve got a great management team that has proven its capability to be a market leader for year.","It is business that again has some ups and downs in that work as well. I think you are doing some really exciting things. As I look out, on the shows I touched on coming, we feel great about where it\u2019s going. So, for us, there are challenges we got this year. We take them seriously, but when I look at the structural underpinning of what gets us to that $9 billion taller target, those structural underpinnings there and we continue to execute on and we continue to conclude distribution agreements, and that enable us to get there.","We continue to build the array of business platforms, channels, really are putting the fundamentals in place that are important to reach those goals, our new channels, while we're investment in them, investments in FXX and FS1 are pretty much on target with what we expected to invest. So, there is an investment going into it, but we're still very excited about the future of those businesses. So, as we look out the fundamentals are really still in place. We need execute better in a couple of businesses and \u2013 but that\u2019s really the core of what we're dealing with here.","On Aereo, it\u2019s headed to the Supreme Court in the six months. I think we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that that will hopefully bring them an end to deliberate illegal theft of our content. I do want to be clear because you hear a lot about this, this case is about respecting copyrights, not about cloud computing. We hear a lot of scaremongering to this case, threatening to cloud computing, nothing to be further from the truth.

It simply needs to be done in the way that respects our copyrights, and we will pursue our rights. Right now we\u2019re pursuing a legal we are pursuing, through the paths we\u2019ve described before. But at the end of the day, our business needs to have a dual revenue model and needs to be in a place that we could be competitive to the marketplace. Hopefully, we got those rights reaffirmed through this process.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne of Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Chase, do you think there is anything going on with Cable News beyond just the normal news cycle. I just asked because it's really across all Cable News Network we've seen, -- creating I think disappointing advertising? Then, James could you talk about Sky Deutschland and the outlook there, they had a really bullish print today and outlook. But Netflix is coming to Germany. The market seems to be a bit spooked, what that could mean. How do you think that business is positioned in the face of and historically price sensitive German consumer and an over-the-top new entrant?","Chase Carey","For us and Fox News realistically, no -- last year they had -- the end of last year they had to deal with the off political cycle, and there is no question that the year-on-year comparisons were tough for a non-political year against the political spending from the year before. But actually the news network is doing right. I think it's rating since January are up year-on-year, I think I said in the last call, we made a series of changes that are actually morning show with the talent we reorganized the primetime lineup, I think launched or introduced a little while ago 5 O'Clock, which has been a great addition to the lineup. I think put new energy in it, I think the audience is actually \u2013 versus what it was recently, for genres it's younger and bigger. ","So for us, we feel pretty good about where we are at and again we have to fight through the cyclicality of political spending, which gets bigger and bigger. Many people's chagrin in other arenas, but becomes a bigger factor that creates cyclicality here, but for us Fox News is realistically just a locomotive fit that keeps going and with that I do think Fox Business is really beginning to hit its stride. I think it\u2019s great moves. I think Maria Bartiromo has been adding a great dimension to it. We continue to strengthen distribution agreements to Fox business and I think that channel really has an increasingly exciting future as it really begins to carve out a space of the distribution platform finally fully in place and I think a lot of moves, we\u2019ve just made in the line-up started to get some traction.","Ben just on Germany, I think, I mean obviously, Brian and the team reported results earlier today are I guess, I guess very early this morning, our time. And so I don't want to add too much to that, but look I say, it's a very competitive marketplace. It's a marketplace that you have traditionally. We've been competing with free satellite channels as well as in Cable and IPTV services. But I think Sky Deutschland's positioned really well. I think the brand is you know increasingly established in a marketplace just after \u2013 only after a few short-years. The quality of the product is very high, and really Sky Deutschland's positioning, where it's available over any infrastructure be it cable, IPTV or satellite, as well as the very, very successful Sky Go TV Everywhere product and now the new stand-alone over the top products. ","Now, I think the Company is positioned well. Look Germany is a very big market. I think we've shown over the last few years that you can increase your revenue per customer there and you can attract new customers which a lot of people didn't think was possible, and the Company has really a momentum to it and is on a trajectory that we think is very encouraging. So, I think it's not a zero-sum game. I think there is a lot of choice in the marketplace already. We already have WATCHEVER there and other things like that, and it's going to continue to be dynamic and competitive. But as long as we can keep innovating and keep a good quality product on screen for our customers, I think the Company is going to continue to do well.","Thank you, Ben. Next question please. ","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Mr.Douglas Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","Chase, I'm curious if there is an opportunity over time for BSkyB, Sky Deutschland and SKY Italia to work more closely together. Is there potential upside form that and separately, John or Chase, I think you implied, Chase, the Company is still on track for $9 billion of EBITDA in fiscal '16. Any help that you can give us for the cadence in fiscal '15 growth versus fiscal '16 growth given the lower fiscal '14 base would be helpful.","Chase Carey ","In terms of the Sky's, I think we do think they truly \u2013 they clearly benefits the Sky's working together they share technologies, they share many \u2013 certainly many of the operational fundamentals of the businesses they share across them. We went down the path to acquire BSkyB and part of that was a view that there were values in having those businesses more closely aligned. ","We're obviously not on that path today, so I think we're trying to do more and more of that and find ways we can capture the value by having those companies, share things they've learned, share expertise, benefit from each other and win-win ways. And hopefully, we'll continue to try and get and exploit that. But I think it's an opportunity where there are opportunities to have those businesses learn and benefit from each other, and I think we'll continue to try and find ways to tackle that given where we're at structurally. ","I think in terms of guidance, looking at the years \u2013 looking through the years, again, you take one of the two the issues in sort of '14, if you take the two, one is film, which is sort of, I don't want to completely call it a one-off, but in many ways was the result of films released during the last six months. They don't have much of an impact, realistically; the issues that caused the shortfall in the film business in '14 aren't going to really affect '15 at all. I mean '15 will be affected by how our films perform in the next six months, we feel good about them, but the flow-through of the films we've released to-date is fairly marginal issue in '15.","I think for the network in many ways, it is again sort of that transition. I mean we've gone through the network in many ways it was the network that had this unique franchise American Idol that sort of transcended everything else in Television. And it\u2019s gotten to a place today. Well, actually it\u2019s a great show. It's a top-ish show, we'd love to have the ratings for that on any other show but if not a show that sort of drives the whole network and the way it did in years past. And so we've been planning that adjustment knowing that the show is 13 years old, we hope it has 14, 15, 16, 17th years but they won't be years that look like years five, six and seven. So this transition of the network from having this sort of locomotive that's sat there in the middle of it that generated unique profits, we've known is coming to the end.","It sort of winding down to a place where it becomes just a great successful show again hopefully this year, we think it's a much better show hopefully there is traction, gets better traction as it goes through this season. We think it has the potential. We think they've done a really good job and it's a very entertaining show. But it's going to be a good show. And what's happened is, the ratings for that as well as X Factor, fell faster than we hoped. But directionally it's not different. We didn't expect those, we haven't been planning on those to sort of all of a sudden have a rebirth. What we'd hope to do was manage them through this process. So, it probably moves those to a slightly lower base, but it really isn't directionally different than what we would have been planning which is -- those shows to be part of the lineup, and really part of a broader diversified lineups we're increasingly looking to develop is new hits to take them on.","So again, I don't think it puts the network, yes, may be a little bit but not really materially in a different place. So, I don't think those two items, still really I wouldn't say changed our view on '15 much at all. I think the network probably marginally, and the rest of it, there are some issues that are tougher than we planned. The foreign exchange is that we start up the year and we think we had a $100 million hit from foreign exchange and now it's looking sort of well north of $150 million. So there are some of those issues and those we put in a jump, put in the ordinary course up and down, the upside in sports could absorb the hit on foreign exchange and other pros and cons.","So, I think those give and takes we had assumed, we can sort of manage through those give and takes. So, I don't think it would change our outlook on '15 that much again. '15, we do expect it to be a big bounce up in '16, and I think that still true. I mean we're still very much in a build process, and I think we talked about the investment in the new channels and actually said the build is actually the investment in the new channels is actually a little higher in '15 than '14, and that's been planned. I mean that's sort of due to the way the sports rights roll-in. But again, it's a long-winded answer. If I look at it holistically, I don't think as we look at '15 and '16, we're really in that different place. Obviously by the end of year, we'll see. Well, it's six more months and we'll know more than we do today, but I wouldn't say I feel that different about '15 and really don't feel different about '16, where we'll be.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Doug. Can we have next question please ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thank you. One for James and one for Chase. James, now that you control all of STAR Sports for roughly a year, could you just talk about what you've done differently and maybe you can provide some color about investments still needed in the ultimate growth trajectory for that business? Then Chase on FXX, with The Simpsons coming in August, it just seems like such an amazing branding opportunity. Can you talk about how that show can drive the channel and how quickly you can monetize it?","James Murdoch","Thanks Jessica. On STAR Sports, so I think it's been really exciting period for us since being able to takeover ESPN share and move with ESPN STAR Sports and that's really been across Asia, really the creation of a Fox Sports brand in Southeast Asia, East Asia and the STAR Sports suite of channels in India. Just on Start Sports it's been very exciting. As Chase mentioned, six STAR Sports channels were launched at the -- towards the end of last year. And some of the things that's exciting about it, for example doing a 24 hour Hindi language coverage of Indian cricket would seem reasonably obvious and surprising that it hadn't been done before and that's proving very, very successful.","From an investment perspective, it's a little bit lumpy. As you know we had some additional ticket rights and additional [indiscernible] in the last quarter in India, and some of those things will continue to be a little bit booked across years and things like that, particularly impacting the STAR Sports business over the next few years. But we think it adds really a fundamental new dimension to the Indian business. We're a leader there in the general entertainment category and many, many of regional languages of India and have really got the number one network across the country. Adding sports to that portfolio, we think is very, very exciting, it gives us a whole new dimension from the standpoint of affiliate revenue growth and we can really cement our leadership. So, we think it's a real component of getting that business as we've said in the past to the overall Star business in India should be a $0.5 billion profit business within a reasonable horizon, but this investment in this year and next year and a bit in the next given some of the rights cost that come through, is a big investment, but it's really a testament to our belief and what we can do in that region, and we think India is a marketplace that's going to be increasingly important for us and one where we can relate \u2013 put even more distance between us and our nearest competitors.","Chase Carey","On FXX, I mean there is no question. Simpsons is tremendously exciting and important event and sort of opportunity for us. We do \u2013 it is more than a show, I have said it before. In many ways we look to use that. When I turn in the Simpsons channel, but in many ways it will be the face of the channel, it will clearly be much more than just a series taking up a large block of hours. It will be a series that helps brand the channel, helps drive the channel and we are doing \u2013 working really hard on it. We're also really excited that it is really gone up in many ways the breadth of rights we have there will enable us to do some really unique things in the digital sense. So it's not just branding the channel from a linear perspective, but really starting to \u2013 really create some precedence in terms of creating a digital experience aligned with that channel that adds a whole new dimension to it.","Towards the monetizing it, it's always in the cable in this world. It's always a little complicated, because you can monetize through two things, monetize through affiliations and you monetize through advertising. So the affiliation side is obviously tied to its affiliation and the freedoms come up. If you don't have it up there, and I think fortunately, we are in a place in part of what's the timing. It's a pretty big block of our affiliation agreements in the sort of year plus post, I think probably half of that universe comes up for renewal within a year and change. I don't again, I didn\u2019t look at it sort of had the exact dates off the top of my head - from when then Simpsons roll-in. So, the way we can get momentum, clearly the \u2013 monetizing it through the affiliation side, is obviously a big part of it.","I think from an advertising perspective, it's going to better execution. I think FX has proved to be pretty good at sort of distinguishing themselves from everybody else out there. I think they are demand-relative; I think they are second to none if you stack FX up against the channels they compete with today. I think they have proven ability to distinguish themselves from the pack, and I can say we feel really good about their ability to drive a level of interest into that, that we could monetize through advertising, but we feel really good about it. But I want to say that.","At the end of the day, this is, we're building an asset. I mean the question \u2013 I'm much more sort of focused on where can you get this in two to three years and where can you get this in two quarters? So, it is \u2013 this is opportunity to build a franchise that can be a real tent pole for new growth in our business. So I think it is, yes we care about short-term and want to do what we can to drive short-term. But, building an asset like that and investing it, it was \u2013 I think the real key issues is where can you get that business to in two to three years, not in two to three months.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Richard Greenfield of BTIG, please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG","Hi, thanks for taking my question, I wanted to follow-up on Michael Nathanson's question. When you look at a show like the Simpsons, you've actually acquired all of the prior season rights to use for your application and so, instead of selling that to a Netflix or Amazon, you are keeping all of that for yourself to drive traffic to your apps. Wondering, when you look at shows like The Americans and any of your shows or content you are creating, why is it not the right decision for FOX to keep those rights in-house to build your own direct-to-consumer applications versus selling them to third parties, I realize there is a near term cash infusion from selling them. Why is the Simpsons decision not the right decision for all of your content as you look forward?","Then just a separate question on Formula One rights, there is lot of noise about Malone and Discovery possibly buying them it seems like something that would fit very well with Fox globally or is that something of interest to you?","Chase Carey","On the Simpson's question \u2013 the rights question of why not keep all our rights in-house. I think it's important. I think if you go back to Michael's question and again I think there is a real benefit to us being, we believe the vertical integration of our business is the real strength. I think the strength comes from having a strategic understanding of both sides of that, better insights and ability to make that's where they make sense. But I think when you get to one size fits all I think that's, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to go. I think at a more granular level you have to sort of look at decisions, on one level holistically and on another level for each individual business and those businesses have to make bets. There are times when our distribution businesses have a unique ability to take advantage of our set of rights for us -- to me the Simpsons is the perfect example. ","We have a new channel that FX, that Simpsons could help take to a whole new level. So it made sense for us to probably invest more than anybody else in The Simpsons because we can monetize it in terms of building a unique asset. In the other terms when somebody else for a piece of content we own has a unique need that will end up means they are going to pay more than it's worth to our asset. And they just say, we are going to keep it, nonetheless even if somebody else thinks, because they have a need worth a lot more than it is to us. I don\u2019t think that makes sense I think it's important that, and we are not going to do is undersell the content. ","We are precautious. We have people in it, it's important that our content gets full and fair value and therefore if somebody in the market sees much more value in that content than we do, whether it is because of a need or just because of a belief then there are places where it makes sense to take advantage of that, conversely I think we hopefully have a breadth of assets that will increasingly let up, take advantage of assets and example FIC, I mean Fox International Channel. There are a number of place where we have taken series and bought out the international rights to shows we had. ","A unique need, we had a unique franchise in Fox International Channels to take a show like the Americans or, I can't remember they have done a couple. They bought the global right, global distribution rights to that and used it as a dimension. But it was really based on the Fox International Channels having unique strategic need and ability to build the value that enable them to make a bet. But again there'll be places where third parties will see a value that exceeds what it's worth to us and I think that\u2019s the right way to maximize the business. ","We have the benefit of the visibility to make intelligent decisions. So, where we think it's worth making a bet. We obviously have the ability to see the picture holistically and make those bets intelligently but I do think you have to look at it from holistically as well as from each individual businesses perspective. And then Formula One, Formula One is great rights I mean at the end of the day they are buying I guess, I don\u2019t know what's going on in Formula One I read the same paper you do. We like rights they are talking about buying sport and I guess to what degree you can buy sports to get the rights, I mean I think if you are buying, you have to buy because you like the sport. ","You believe the sport is a good investment. There are a lot of things that go into the sport and that Formula One certainly TV rights are a big part of it, but there are other big elements on the revenue side and obviously it's a big business that requires expertise management. So I think very good business but I think you'd go into it, if it's for TV rights, I don\u2019t think you buy the asset, to get access to the TV rights. I think you buy it because you think it's good business. And I think TV rights we license it in the marketplace and we obviously have a good relationship with Formula One and hopefully continue to build it. But I think to the degree there is investment in Formula One, anybody making that whether it's up to anybody else you'd have to make it on the merits of what you think about Formula One and how good investment is and what's the future of that.","James Murdoch","And Rich, it\u2019s James here. I'd just remind everyone we are a broadcaster of Formula One in almost every region in the world. We are a very large part of Formula One's audience and in many places we have very long term rights agreements to Formula One and it delivers very well for our customer. And irrespective of whatever speculation is out there in the market we think that\u2019s been a relationship that\u2019s great for both sides and is going to continue.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG","Thank you for clarifying. ","James Murdoch","Thank you, Rich. Do we have next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets ","Okay, thanks. Chase, I was wondering if you could give us a trajectory that kind of benchmark over the next 12 to 36 months for viewership and ratings levels you expect to achieve at FS1. I also wonder if you could talk about how you see the business mix with respect to affiliate fees and advertising revenue shaking out when you get closer to maturity three or four years out when your new programming had sort of been on for a while like MLB, when you have no more speed legacy deals in place, basically at maturity, how do you see the revenue split between advertising and affiliate?","Chase Carey","Yeah, I mean first I don't think we probably would get to that level of granularity on year-by-year sort of rate increase that's probably just a level of detail beyond what we sort of put out there publicly. I think if you look out over time, I think the mix of affiliate and ad revenues and particularly on the sport side, probably tilts to the affiliate side of it. That's the nature of sports today that the importance of that end product it is, again I think it is the most important product, it is the most powerful product that again and not everybody certainly for a large segment of consumers, it is must-have product for a large segment of consumers. And therefore I think that's what leads for it to get reflected its value to get reflected in the affiliation side of it. ","The advertising is certainly important. The live nature of the sport as I said before makes it uniquely valuable to advertisers. I mean you look at the NFL this year, I think it certainly probably is good as recent testament as you can find anywhere of how valuable sports is to advertisers. So, I don't mean to, certainly not trying to minimize the importance of the advertising side of it. But I think in general in the sports arena, the affiliate side will be the larger piece of the pie vis-a-vis advertising.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Is that kind of a 50-50 mix or like a 70-30 mix, sorry just taking one more pass at it.","Chase Carey ","We're not going to get into that type of granularity. It's -- the affiliate side, it's a bigger piece of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan; please go ahead. ","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JPMorgan","Just sort of staying on that sports theme, we keep seeing more evidence of rising competition for the sports rights and obviously the rising cost of each franchises. Do the revenues generated, it sounds like to me so, it seems more than the advertising the growing TPMs in audience. I guess do they make up for the higher programming cost. You got such great prospective from your extensive franchise and obviously the Super Bowl. I am curious about the cost equation how that delta maybe changing going forward. Is it maybe for the better or for the worse, any color there would be great?","Chase Carey ","I am not sure how to answer that. I guess what I'd say is our sports business we feel right about I mean and obviously we are dealing with these costs. We are -- when we do affiliate deals they are multiyear deals. And it's actually you get a pretty good roadmap for a fair bit of it if the affiliates the larger piece and you get deals that go out years, those rights agreements layer against that, you have to make some assumptions of rating in Ad dollars. But that\u2019s a smaller part of the top line. ","I think we feel like a pretty good visibility given again the nature of long term distribution agreements aligned with long term right agreements and the ability to keep those two things balanced; you have a really healthy business for us. And certainly to-date we have done it. And yes there is pressure on rights and I guess again as I said before it's a double edged nature of sports, it's the most important programming out there and probably gets more important as everything else fragments it sort of continues to in many ways stand taller and so that\u2019s a positive. ","The reality is it comes at a cost. I think we've good pretty track record and ability to be able to digest those costs and build real value. I think we are helped by the fact that I think buyers should have scale in that arena probably best position because I think breadths and depths I mean it's one thing, just sort of have a one-off. But I think to the degree you've got a broad array of sports for us regional, national, global, domestic. You sort of got something for everybody and I think that it really helps and I think gives it a bit of one plus one is three. ","So I do think scale is going to become an increasingly important dynamic and the ability to get full value to maximize value for the rights you got. Steve, we have time for one more question, please. ","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities; please go ahead. ","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities","Two questions. One again on sports rights, when you look at the latest sports rights that you have right now for FS1, do you feel like you have enough in terms of what you are trying to accomplish over the next three or four years on the affiliate growth side? Or the next big contract to come up would be the NBA, how do you look at potentially bidding for making an investment in the NBA relative to what your revenue objectives are? And is it important to kind of from a competitive perspective to keep rights away from other networks that is to bolster your own network? And then also on the affiliate side the 5% acceleration that you saw domestically, how much of that came from having NHL back on the air this fall and can you give us any insight on what you think that pace is going to look like in the new calendar year?","Chase Carey ","I will cover the second one for you. It\u2019s that the 15% domestic growth we had in the quarter about 5% of it is the impact of the NHL and Sports Time Ohio. So the underlying growth is about 10%. We've said that we expect double-digit gains in affiliate fees in the year and we're comfortable with that. In terms of the rights we have, simple answer is, yeah, we have to have the rights in place we need to execute the plan we've got. That doesn't mean we won't engage on new rights and I think we've always want to be opportunistic. If there is a dimension of rights, we're not going to buy everything. ","So, we are going to be selective, but it doesn't mean that there won't be opportunities to add something that we think we can in turn down the road create incremental value. But the rights we have today, and then we've got a broad set of rights -- baseball, NASCAR, college football and basketball, UFC, soccer, champions league, world cup, golf, we've got a broad mix of rights, broad mix of rights and spread across the year. We feel great about where we're at. So certainly, we have the rights in place to execute the plans we've got. ","But certainly we'll look at incremental rights and make a determination, the rights we could take on and create incremental value on them, and if not, and we feel very good about where we're at. In terms of -- I wouldn't take rights to keeping away from others, I think you'd be able to -- you're obviously building your own business, not spending money to -- if we can't make. I think our sports channel will be strong enough. We're comfortable that we can -- and we got enough breadth across the company that we can execute on delivering the value through our sports channel. We wouldn't invest in further rights, it'll have to make sense for us, we wouldn't invest with a purpose being to block others.","Reed Nolte","At this point, we'd like to conclude today's call.

On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdock, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we'll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.

Nallen","Thank you, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing the fiscal 2013 results, I'd like to highlight some of the changes that you will have noted in today's earnings release. On June 28, the company completed the separation of its business into 2 independent, publicly traded companies, Twenty-First Century Fox and the new News Corporation. Following the separation, the company does not hold any equity interest in the new News Corp. As a result of this transaction, the new News Corp's historical financial results are reflected in the company's financial statements as discontinued operations. The new News Corp will be providing further detail on their own financial results when they file their Form 10-K with the SEC.","At Twenty-First Century Fox, we are reporting our results in 5 business segments, including the segment now named Other, Corporate and Eliminations. This segment primarily reflects the company's corporate overhead costs, as well as the aggregation of all intercompany eliminations for all periods. Prior to the separation, the old News Corporation, these eliminations were reported within the individual operating segments, primarily the Film segment.","I would also note our use of segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as we refer to it, as our primary performance metric. The company now evaluates and will be reporting performance of its operating segments based on segment EBITDA.","Finally, the historical information reflecting all of these changes are presented in the back of today's press release for your convenience.","So with that housekeeping covered, let me turn to Twenty-First Century Fox's full year results first. Annual total segment EBITDA was $6.26 billion, 9% higher than the $5.76 billion generated a year ago. This increase was driven by the continued growth at the company's Cable and Television segments, partially offset by declines at the DBS segment. The Film segment's contributions were consistent with the prior year. Overall, the Twenty-First Century Fox businesses delivered growth in line with our expectation range.","Reported net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $6.82 billion or $2.91 per share, which included $3.76 billion of income included as Other net, relating to gains on the acquisition of additional ownership stakes in Sky Deutschland and ESPN Star Sports, as well as the gain on the sale of NDS. Additionally, full year results include gains of $306 million from the company's participation in BSkyB's buyback program and $48 million in restructuring and impairment costs related to the company's digital games business, which we sold this past February. Excluding the net income effects of these items and comparable items in both years, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $1.36 compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.20. This 13% improvement principally reflects our net income growth and the impact of our share repurchases during the year.","Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. For the quarter, the company reported total segment EBITDA of $1.49 billion, a 14% increase over the $1.31 billion reported in the fourth quarter a year ago. This increase reflects continued strong growth in our Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower contributions at the company's other operating segments.","The company reported net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders in the fourth quarter of $977 million versus $596 million a year ago. This growth primarily reflects the increased contributions from the company's Cable segment, as well as the impact of restructuring and impairment charge recognized in the prior year fourth quarter. Current year quarterly results also include gains of $89 million from the company's participation in BSkyB's buyback program and $81 million of income in Other, net, reflecting net gains on various asset sales and acquisitions. Excluding these gains and the restructuring and impairment charges and comparable items in the prior year, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to shareholders were $0.31 per share as compared to $0.27 per share in the prior year quarter.","Now let me provide some comments on the fourth quarter performance at a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating close to 3\/4 of the company's total segment EBITDA. Fourth quarter EBITDA contributions increased over 25% from year-ago levels to $1.08 billion, reflecting strong domestic growth led by FOX News and the National Geographic channels and significant increases at our international channels led by the Fox International Channels in Latin America and in Asia. This growth continues to be primarily top line-driven, with segment revenues up 16%.","Affiliate fees at the cable networks increased 17% over year-ago levels, with domestic channels' affiliate fees up 9%, driven by our affiliate renewals earlier in the fiscal year. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 41%, with half of this growth reflecting comparable strong organic growth led by FIC and the other half relating to the international sports channels and foreign exchange.","Fourth quarter advertising revenues for the segment were up 10% over year-ago levels, with domestic ad growth of 4% and international growth of 20%. At our international channels, local currency organic advertising growth was approximately 10% after excluding the effects of the sports channels and foreign exchange.","Fourth quarter expenses at the Cable Networks increased 12% over year-ago level, primarily reflecting the costs associated with the new international sports networks at FIC and at STAR.","At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $213 million declined $22 million versus the fourth quarter a year ago. This is largely due to the impact of a 7% advertising revenue decline driven by lower American Idol ratings and by lower-based ad markets and political revenues at the stations. These reductions more than offset higher retransmission revenues.","In our Film segment fourth quarter EBITDA was $117 million, a $23 million decline compared to a year ago, primarily reflecting a $35 million provision we took relating to some older library product, specifically the Mary Tyler Moore library, which we acquired in the 1990s. This quarter also included continued contributions from Ice Age: Continental Drift and The Croods for DreamWorks Animation, offset by comparatively higher launch costs from the timing of this year's theatrical releases, including Wolverine and Turbo for DreamWorks Animation.","Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $156 million in the quarter as compared to $168 million in the prior year quarter. This decline reflects the positive impact from the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's EBITDA results being more than offset by lower contributions from SKY Italia. Our results included $490 million in Sky Deutschland revenues, which reflected ARPU gains of 5% and a year-over-year increase in their subs of 320,000. At SKY Italia, lower profit contributions are primarily the result of the current challenging economic environment in Italy that continues to impact subscriber additions, with SKY reporting a net loss of 27,000 subs in the quarter. Local currency revenues were below those of a year ago, with a slight increase in ARPU being more than offset by the reduced subscriber base, yielding lower subscription revenue.","So from the Twenty-First Century Fox total segment EBITDA basis, we ended the year up 9% and the fourth quarter up 14%. We also ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion in cash and $16.5 billion of gross debt. Since the date of the separation, we have been consistently repurchasing FOXA shares, resulting in approximately $320 million of repurchases from July 1 through today. We will provide further specifics around our capital plans, including our dividend and share repurchase plan at the Investor Day on Thursday.","So now let me address our guidance for fiscal 2014. The base for our guidance that we will measure ourselves against is the fiscal 2013 total segment EBITDA of $6.26 billion that we just reported. In 2014, our growth will be impacted by several strategic initiatives, most notably the launch of Sports Networks here in the U.S. and in Asia, as well as the launch of FXX. Additionally, we are expecting adverse currency effects to impact 2014 growth, principally from Latin American currencies and the Indian rupee. Considering these items and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are anticipating our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for 2014 to be in the high single to low double-digit range above the $6.26 billion base level for fiscal 2013. Now the overall growth will be driven by our cable segment, which represented 2\/3 of our EBITDA this past year. This segment will post continued solid growth even after absorbing investments of $200 million and change in 2014 for the launch of the new channels and the comparative negative currency impact of approximately $100 million. These factors will impact our company-wide growth by around 4%.","We are expecting the Television segment to post strong growth in 2014 even after factoring in over $150 million and increased programming and marketing investments at the network to support rating leadership. Growth at this segment will be underpinned by continuing increases in retransmission consent revenues. While we will also benefit from the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVIII, this benefit will be largely offset by reduced political revenues at the TV stations from the record level we had in 2013.","On the content side, we are expecting the fiscal '14 results at our Filmed Entertainment segment to be down a touch to this past year as we prudently would not forecast our releases to have the level of contribution that Ice Age 4 had during 2013.","And finally, our DBS segment will benefit a bit from the inclusion of the EBITDA results from Sky Deutschland.","So overall, our businesses are well-positioned for continued growth, and we look forward to sharing considerably more details with you at the Investor Day this Thursday.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase for some additional comments.","Chase Carey","Thanks, John. I'll be reasonably brief in my comments today in light of our Investor Day upcoming this Thursday. In many ways, the last year is the one in which we put in place the foundation for which we will grow Twenty-First Century Fox over the next 3 to 5 years. Obviously, the defining event for that foundation was the split of News Corporation to enable us to streamline our operations and bring an enhanced focus and alignment to Twenty-First Century Fox. But we achieved much more than that.","At our U.S. channels, we continue to build in our leadership position in key channels like Fox News and FX while strengthening emerging channels like National Geographic and Fox Business, with stronger distribution and improved programming. We displayed the ability to continue to successfully navigate the regional sports arena by strengthening that business with the addition of an equity stake in YES and a new Ohio regional. We successfully renewed affiliation agreements and drove advertising growth with continued momentum in our brand and programming. Most importantly, we positioned ourselves to add critical new networks in sports and entertainment to strengthen our overall portfolio and drive long-term growth.","Internationally, we also built in our leadership in our core entertainment area. Our success in launching series in a global basis like Walking Dead, The Americans and, most recently, The Bridge added an exciting dimension to our business and really began to distinguish our entertainment networks as the first truly global ones. The most significant event has been building a global sports business over the past couple of years to go with our entertainment and nonfiction channels. Some of these sports businesses like Latin America were a bit further along and have already moved to profitability, while others in Asia and Europe are early days. However, they are all underway to bringing a critical new dimension to our business.","At the broadcast network, we had largely completed our initial retransmission agreements with MBPD [ph] and our affiliates. While the fees still represent only a fraction of the value of our content, this provides a base to build a dual revenue stream that will enable Fox to have the economic framework of a cable channel and begin the process of building a profit stream that reflects its importance in the larger universe of cable networks. And we continue to make strides in streamlining our businesses through sales such as NDS or acquisitions to take control positions like Sky Deutschland.","While the foundation is in place, we recognize the real work lies ahead. In the coming year, our priorities include, first, building our new U.S. sports and entertainment networks and Asian sports networks. We will invest $200 million plus in 2014 and a bit more in 2015 due to onetime cricket events in India. These networks should turn profitable in 2016 and will be on their way to being major profit centers for us. Investing is well in our broadcast network and executing a plan designed for the future, not one quitted to broadcast rules of the past. This means different order in launch practices, new development strategies and more. As John noted, we will incrementally invest about $150 million in Fox this year and we do that as an offensive, not defensive, strategy for this dual revenue business. Hit content is more valuable than ever, and this network is a launching pad for the best-to-hit contents so we're excited to invest here.","Additionally, our guidance for fiscal '14 includes an advertising outlook which anticipates that a result from the recent broadcast in cable upfront, along with incremental viewership expected for the Super Bowl. And new domestic and international cable channels will provide continued advertising growth in the year ahead. At our broadcast network, we expect pricing to increase in the mid-to-high single-digits, led by our sports broadcasts, and we project low single-digit growth in the local ad markets. Current scatter markets are strong with double-digit premiums to upfront pricing. Pricing trends at our domestic cable channels are expected to be up in the high single digits and even higher internationally on the strength of Latin America and Asia.","Another key priority is maintaining market leadership in our Film and Television production businesses. The guidance John referred to in the Film segment is a reflection of the challenge in predicting these businesses, not our confidence in them. Our Film group continues to add new dimensions like DreamWorks Animation distribution and Fox International productions while successfully taking advantage of emerging digital distribution opportunities.","Our TV group just finished the pilot season as #1 in new series orders. They also look to build on their momentum and have shown the ability to navigate opportunity in network, basic cable, premium and digital networks. We have a multiyear Netflix deal in place, so the exciting digital arena suggests upside opportunity for this group.","We also aim to effectively execute the plans in place for our controlled satellite platforms. In Germany, with Sky Deutschland, this means building at our current top line momentum, and we expect this year to be one of exciting growth. In Italy, with SKY Italia, the strategy continues to be maintaining market leadership with competitive strength while restructuring costs for the reality of today's Italian economy. We have a number of key content agreements expiring in the next 12 to 24 months that will enable us to achieve our goal of taking $200 million plus as the annual cost of this business.","Profit in 2014 will not be up much on 2013 because these agreements only begin to expire this year, but we will make real headway in 2015 while getting to our goal in 2016. This plan will enable us to have a very profitable and strong SKY Italia, even in the current economic circumstances, that can grow the top line more aggressively when the economy warrants.","There are number of other key initiatives for the coming year such as stretching our balance sheet and liquidity, but we will reserve comments on the rest for Thursday.","With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Chase. And now Chase, James and John will be happy to take a few questions. Again, given we are hosting our investor conference the day after tomorrow, we ask you to limit your questions to the results and guidance we just reviewed, as we will be addressing a much broader array of topics on Thursday, with ample time for additional questions then. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will start with the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chase, can you give us a sense in your budget for fiscal '14 what percentage of Fox Sports 1 subscriber base that launched will be on the new rate card versus the old speed rate card? It seems at least Comcast [indiscernible] more cable over there. And is there any way to pull forward other distribution contracts? What have you assumed in the guidance for this year?","Chase Carey","Yes. I'm not going to get into individual discussions. Look, I guess, in general right there is we're confident about the targets. We've got [indiscernible] channel, and we're comfortable with where we are in the process. And we're engaged with a number of parties. This process usually has a lot of conversations that sort of have occurred. Certain details to get worked out at the last minute, but we actually feel good about where we are. And I think those conversations with any individual players will probably best adding Friday[ph]","Operator","We'll go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm sure we'll get into this on Thursday. Chase, I was wondering if you could comment on the decisions around Hulu, a fact that the business now seems to be more of a strategic asset for you guys and you're in an investment mode. And I was just curious, John, if you could give us any sense for working capital for '14. It was actually a pretty big drag in fiscal '13 of about $1 billion. I wondered if you had any comments as to sort of why that was and what we should think about for fiscal '14.","Chase Carey","Yes, I think on Hulu, yes, I think it's really a case where we know -- I think we've always known the importance of these digital platforms and the opportunities specifically at Hulu. I think the real question was partnerships are complicated and can we get aligned around the strategy we both believe we can execute to be successful. And I think as we went through this process, we really found all the constituencies really sort of coalesce around the vision of how to really build this in a way that it can be something exciting content owners or something. It could be an exciting addition to the digital marketplace and something that, in many ways, could enhance the existing ecosystems. And so I think we know the importance of digital, so making the capital, in many ways, would the easiest part once we had a plan that we all were aligned around and believed we could execute on.","John P. Nallen","And then to respond to the working capital, you'll see the biggest change there comes from our buildup of inventory, which is, at the end of the year, we had 5 enormous films in production as compared to where we were a year ago, led by Wolverine and a few other big ones coming out this year. And likewise, on the TV side, we've got the most new series in the history of the company under development right now. So a lot of that is just the production spend toward those series. Looking to '14, our expectations are we're going to see our revenue grow much more significantly in the fourth quarter than this year. So when you look at our overall year, we'll probably be a touch below where that working capital is, but it's all because of the growth in the business.","Chase Carey","Yes. And I guess the only other dynamic I'd add to that is as we're growing these new channels, clearly, there's a ramp-up to invest. We want to invest in content. We want these channels to be channels we can be excited about. So both from the sports and entertainment side, we've been investing to ramp up in the content to fuel FS 1 and FXX, as well as the international channel additions.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one clarification and one question. Chase, you said on Sky Deutschland, I'm not sure what you said about increasing your ownership. I know you increased it already, but did you say that you're going to plan to own it fully?","Chase Carey","No, I didn't. I didn't say anything about -- I didn't touch on the ownership, [indiscernible] we are comfortable where we are. Our focus is on driving Sky Deutschland to be as successful as it can be. But if I did, I didn't mean to. I didn't think it. We did not -- right now, our focus is on driving it to be successful, and we feel good about the momentum in that business.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about -- in the underlying guidance, you just gave the impact of some of the lumpy syndication deals like Modern Family and Glee and Cleveland, how they impact you, as well as the assumptions for OTT revenues. And also, if you could just touch a little bit upon domestic ad revenue trends. They seemed a little bit weaker domestically than I might have expected. Is there anything interesting going on -- anything that could be driving some softness there.","Chase Carey","I think in terms -- I mean, first, one syndication side, it's not actually as lumpy as it used to be. It used to sort of recognize everything on the first day of unveil [ph] and now really gets recognized-- like Modern Family, which obviously -- we think it could potentially be a $1 billion profit franchise. But you don't -- you now recognize it really over the certain life of that flow. So you don't have the lumpiness you used to in the syndication marketplace. So there are products that are coming in and out, but it doesn't have that onetime event. Some of the franchises like Simpsons are still a fiscal year away. So The Simpsons is fiscal '15, not '14. So there's a benefit, but there are always some things -- there are a couple like -- and I think How I Met Your Mother is one that will be less than it was. We had something this year that won't replicate this year. So yes, there's gives and takes in there but not the drama that used to be there. I think our OTT, we're being reasonably [indiscernible]. To me, that's an upside opportunity. I mean, what essentially we've got is a multiyear sort of foundation, now with the deal with Netflix in place. And so we sort of got the base. We're not assuming just because I think it's difficult to predict. I think there's a lot of promise for new entrants and new opportunities probably in both U.S. and overseas, but I think we are not going to sort of bank on those. So I think we've made it reasonably conservative assumption based on what we know, that we think there are opportunities for a much more dynamic marketplace as the year evolves. And I guess the third?","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Domestic ad trends.","Chase Carey","Domestic ad trends, yes. Well, I guess, look, we're out in the fourth quarter with -- because the network ratings worked well, obviously, it should affect the advertising in the stations and the network, and that's -- yes, there's no question of the fact that Idol did not deliver as we hoped, we've made some steps, put new leadership directly in place. I mean, David Hill, who has shown a unique touch in a number of places, trying to believe that. It's still a show -- it's still a profitable show and still a top 5 show. And we think there's an opportunity to reamortize that, but there's no question American Idol affected our broadcast. It still affected it there. I think the other dynamic in the cable is probably at a degree of political spending that you sort of saw year-on-year as you went into that quarter. It obviously affects places like the news arena and others where you get that fairly significant slump[ph]. But midyear, politics, from 2012 to 2013. I think by and large, I mean, if I look at it today, actually, the local business at the stations is actually stronger than it was a quarter ago, and it's picked up. It's at the scatter market on -- the broadcast network is actually pretty strong. And some of the cable networks like FX and some others, it's really dynamic. So right now, there's actually some pretty good energy in the marketplace.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, David. At this time, I think we're kind of out of time, and I want to thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. And we look forward to seeing many of you in the next day or 2 at our conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Co-Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we will have some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2014 identifies risks and opportunities and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, the call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income and depreciation and amortization often referred to as EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","Also note that the historical results for periods prior to June 28, 2013 described in the press release and on this call have been adjusted to reflect the separation that was completed at the end of fiscal 2013.","And with that, I am pleased to turn it over to John.","John Nallen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Reed and good afternoon. As you will have seen in today\u2019s earnings release, our third quarter results reflect solid financial growth across the company resulting in double-digit percentage increases in total company revenues, segment EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share. We reported third quarter fiscal 2014 revenues for the total company of $8.22 billion, which is up 12% from a year ago on the strength of our Cable Network, the broadcast of this year\u2019s Super Bowl and continued growth at Sky Deutschland.","Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.79 billion, a 14% increase over the $1.57 billion reported a year ago. This increase reflects strong growth of the company\u2019s Cable Network and Television segments, as well as a modest increase in Film segment contributions. These EBITDA improvements were partially offset by lower DBS contribution.","Overall, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced our EBITDA growth rate by approximately 2%. This year\u2019s third quarter reflected the recognition of various tax benefits, which reduced our overall effective tax rate in the quarter to approximately 20% and approximately 25% for the nine months. As we indicated during our Investor Day last August, we expect that going forward our annual tax rate will be around the low 30% range. From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.07 billion or $0.47 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of amounts reflected in other net and our gains from participating in BSkyB share repurchase program, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.47 this year versus $0.32 in the prior year.","Now, let me provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our segments. And let\u2019s start with the cable network segment, where total segment revenues in the third quarter increased 11% from last year highlighted by a 12% increase in affiliate revenues and 6% advertising growth. From an affiliate fee perspective, domestic affiliate fees increased 12% primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and Fox News as well as the benefit from the convert and the launch of our new channels, FS1 and FXX.","Our reported international affiliate fees were also up 12% with strong local currency growth of about 21%, reflecting increases at the Fox International Channels that were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements, primarily in Latin America. Third quarter advertising revenue growth at the cable segment reflects domestic advertising increases of 8% led by double-digit gains at Fox News. At the International Channels, reported advertising revenue increased 4%. Local currency ad revenues were up 14%, but this was partially offset by unfavorable currency movements led by India.","Total Cable segment EBITDA in the quarter of $1.18 billion was up 10% over prior year level. We had very strong underlying EBITDA growth at the RSNs, Fox News, FIC, STAR Entertainment, and the FX channels. The particular strength of the FX channels include higher contributions from the SVOD sales of their series to Amazon and lower programming cost from the shift of the start date for some original series to later in the quarter as compared to last year. Our overall cable segment EBITDA growth rate of 10% reflects growth of 13% at our domestic channels and a slight decline at our international channels, principally from unfavorable foreign currency movements and the impact of our planned investment in STAR Sports in India.","Combined foreign currency and the new channel initiatives negatively impacted cable segment EBITDA growth this quarter by 6% with the channel launches on their own impacting growth by 2% and that was primarily from the incremental investment in STAR Sports. Additionally, the EBITDA contribution from the consolidation of the YES Network this year was substantially offset by the negative comparative impact of similarly unique items from a year ago.","At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $288 million increased 32% from last year\u2019s result on revenue increases of 27%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year\u2019s Super Bowl, which generated approximately $350 million in revenues and from continued growth in retransmission consent revenue. These increases more than offset the impact of lower general entertainment ratings.","Turning to our Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $354 million, was up 6% from a year ago. This quarter\u2019s results include increased contributions from our television production businesses driven by significantly higher SVOD revenue and the sale of various series to Amazon, including 24, The Americans and How I Met Your Mother as well as the syndication of Modern Family. This growth was partially offset by the prerelease task of Rio 2, which was released after the quarter.","Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $58 million in the quarter as compared to $91 million in the prior year. This decline reflects reduced contributions from Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland principally from higher exclusive sports costs at each platform namely the Sochi Olympics at Sky Italia and Women\u2019s Liga Soccer at Sky D. At Sky Italia, local currency revenues in the quarter were similar to a year ago as the slight ARPU increase was offset by lower average subscribers for the period. Quarter end subs at Sky Italia up $4.75 million were essentially unchanged from the end of December. Sky D reported ARPU gains of 4% and the year-over-year direct subscriber increase of 326,000 yielding 3.73 million subs at quarter end.","Now, turning to our cash flow, you will see that our operating cash flow for the first nine months of this year is behind the year ago levels. The main operating factors driving this are our planned increased investment in film and television production, increased sports rights payments and the increased acquisition of series and movies across our channels and platforms in support of long-term growth.","Now, before I turn to our guidance, let me give you a quick update on our buyback and the Australian Securities Exchange delisting process. Since the date of the separation, we have been consistently repurchasing FOXA shares, resulting in approximately $3.2 billion of repurchases from July 1 through yesterday. We remain on track to complete the $4 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe we previously announced. With regards to the delisting process, May 1 was the last day that our shares traded on the ASX. The process completes itself tomorrow with all Fox shares now trading solely in the U.S. market.","So finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2014 total segment EBITDA growth. Since our last earnings call three months ago, we have updated our operational assumptions to reflect our first nine months performance and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our third quarter ended up a little stronger than we have had anticipated, primarily due to timing changes between the third and fourth quarter results, and this primarily reflects the earlier deliveries of content to SVOD distributors including the recent sale to Amazon. That said, we think we continued to anticipate a good quarter of growth in our fourth quarter, which will be led by this year\u2019s comparatively stronger film releases, including Rio 2 and X-Men-Days of Future Past.","Considering all of these factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we continue to expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2014 will be in the mid to high-single digit range, above the $6.26 billion total segment EBITDA base level of fiscal 2013. This is consistent with the guidance update we gave you three months ago. And as I indicated on our last call, overall the consolidation of the YES Network results for only four months this year, it does not materially impact our current fiscal year outlook.","And with that, I will turn it over to Chase.","Chase Carey - President and Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Thank you, John. The third quarter was a solid quarter and we are on track with our revised guidance. We are also frequently asked if we expect to hit our longer term EBITDA target of $9 billion in fiscal 2016, the simple answer is yes. Despite the benefit of an extra half year of the YES Network, we acknowledge that to achieve that 2016 target, we will have to overcome foreign currency headwinds and challenges at the FCC Entertainment Network that we did not plan for last August.","Together, all these items adversely impacts our August assumptions by north of $200 million. However, we will have to work a bit harder, but we expect to hit our target. And our core cable channel networks business, we continue to execute on our expansion plans with newer networks Fox Sports 1, FXX and new international sports networks all gaining strength in programming and distribution. As we have indicated in the past, these networks will take a couple of years to build, but the momentum we are seeing makes us confident that the investments we have made will build long-term value for shareholders and consumers alike. Similarly we are pleased to increase our ownership of the YES Network, now at 80%, enabling us financial and operational consolidation and increasing our total portfolio of managed regional sports networks to 22.","Across our Cable channels business, we are in great shape. FX continues to impress with its original series that are transforming FX into a standout, must have brand. The Americans is delivering strong results, ranking as the top basic cable drama in key demos. We believe the new season of The Americans is benefiting from our innovative partnership with Amazon, which enabled us to not only more deeply monetize our content, but also enable viewers to catch up on the prior seasons. The third installment of the American Horror Story franchise Coven built on the success of the first two story lines and concluded its season as FX\u2019s most watched original series.","In addition, Justified continued its run as a breakthrough series ranking consistently as one of the top scripted dramas on basic cable. We are also at the start of launching a number of new exiting series, Fargo recently premiered and the 10 part limited series is off to a strong start, averaging approximately 4 million total viewers for its first two weeks. And we look forward to premiere this summer of new series Tyrant from the creators of Homeland and The Strain from acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro.","Fox News continues dominate, it\u2019s the only cable news network that drove an increase in both viewership and demo in prime time. We are more convinced than ever that Fox News\u2019 commitment to developing fresh shows with unique edge is key to its success. The O'Reilly Factor, The Kelly File and The Five are all examples of this commitment.","Fox International Channels is also performing well, with successful new launches expanding the Fox channel in Hungary, Fox Sports 2 in Brazil and Italy and Nat Geo People in Germany. In March, the Fox Channel outside the U.S. \u2013 United States reached its highest viewership level ever, up 15% year-on-year and up 9% from February and nearly doubled the viewership of Fox\u2019s nearest global competitor. At the Fox Network, we continue to face challenges despite continued growth in retransmission revenue and a substantial boost in the quarter from the most watched Super Bowl in history.","While the sports side continues to be strong, the performance of the entertainment network remains disappointing. American Idol while a significantly improved show in our opinion simply did not attract the following we had anticipated or the ratings we had hoped for. The key moving forward is to ramp up our commitment to bringing viewers, standout must have programming, shows that are unexpected and that have the power to really break through. We are moving away from the decades old rules of the broadcast business and prioritizing our resources, management and marketing to make sure the programs we air reach their fullest potential.","In a world of infinite choice, the need for breakthrough programming has never been greater. We are also being more opportunistic about what we bring to air, looking to create big event type shows like 24-Live Another Day, which premiered on Monday to strong results. With our upfront presentations scheduled for Monday next week will let our network executives unveil our detailed strategies and line up for next seasons. Generally we anticipate the upfront market will be similar to last year. We continue to believe that Fox is a network that truly stands out. It\u2019s useful, unique and edgy and has a proven history of surprising audiences through shows that redefine the TV viewing experience. None of that has changed. The industry push towards C7 ratings continues to be a priority. We believe more deals against the C7 ratings currency will prove lucrative. Even with the small lift as experienced in our freshman series COSMOS which showed 0.2% increase underscores the potential of real incremental revenue.","Let me now turn to our content business where we are seeing real momentum at the Film Studios. After a few challenging quarters we feel we have turned the tide. Rio 2 from our animation studio, Blue Sky Studios, had a strong showing domestically and continues to rule the international box office since release approaching $400 million in global box office. In addition, The Grand Budapest Hotel has been a critical and commercial success for Fox Searchlight and The Other Woman has exceeded expectations. The success of these films with a field of vastly different segments in the film market underscored the diversity of our film product and Twentieth Century Fox\u2019s ability to create and market films across the audience spectrum.","We are also optimistic about the upcoming releases of X-Men-Days of Future Past, The Fault in Our Stars and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, all of which we believe will perform incredibly well. Our television studio continues to exemplify the benefits of being a content owner in a world with expanding digital options for consumers. Our ability to more deeply monetize our television offerings in the SVOD market continues to expand with the evolving digital marketplace. This past quarter\u2019s record SVOD revenue was a testament to the strength of our products.","Our DBS platforms also continue to demonstratable progress. Last month, SKY Italia signed a deal with Telecom Italia, enabling the distribution of Sky\u2019s premium programming to Telecom\u2019s broadband customers, adding a new market of potential viewers that are unable to install a satellite dish. Sky Deutschland continues to build on its leadership position with year-over-year subscriber additions, driven by investments in exclusive programming, product innovation and customer service and we feel confident that Sky D is on track for accelerated growth this year. In addition to our specific business activities, we are also focused on broader industry trends and events like \u2013 and events including consolidation within the pay-TV industry and the development of over the top offerings. While none of these items will materially impact our financial and operational targets in the near-term, we can assure you we are extremely focused on their evolution and our response to the challenges or opportunities these issues represents. Needless to say, we are still fully convinced that there is no better time to be in the content creation and distribution business.","Now, I would like to turn it back to Reed.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Chase. Now Chase, James and John would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go to the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America","Thanks. I guess, one for Chase and one for James. Chase, can you think about things that can make a difference in the next year on particularly I guess on the Cable Network, the Simpsons seems like one thing for FXX, can you just share with us some of the drivers in the year ahead and how quickly can something like a unique product like the Simpsons have an impact? And for James, I was hoping you could address this constant, just never ending speculation that European satellite platforms will consolidate in one form or another, can you give us your current views on why it does or does not make sense?","Chase Carey","I guess in terms of next year and I do think it\u2019s an important year for the new networks, I mean, both with FXX, where the Simpsons will launch. I think that\u2019s a defining event for the Simpsons. In a manner, it was a defining event for business, because when one of the, as we said before, one of the unique things we got with the Simpsons is really an expanded really almost a unique set of digital rights to really build the type of consumer experience that we think to many which will be a template for the business going forward. And I think equally on the sports side, I think we said before looking domestically, certainly Fox Sports 1, a lot of our events start next year. So, I mean, we are really just starting into baseball, NASCAR, the big events move in next year, the U.S. Open Golf and the USGA Golf World Cup next summer.","So, in many ways, we are sort of still ramping up that entire schedule and that\u2019s not to say, I mean, I see every channel has certainly agendas and objectives it\u2019s looking to achieve, but I think probably you start to think what\u2019s going to be the biggest change; it\u2019s probably the newest network and in many ways the same as you certainly \u2013 in the international channels as well. And I think probably the other business I guess you look at is the DBS business, which really I think, and as we have talked about we are really \u2013 we have been working hard to transform Italy in a way to get its cost reset and to work through a period to reinstill a level of growth into that business. And I think the team there has done a really good job of sort of addressing both the cost and the challenge of economy that\u2019s still fairly had its challenges, even some of the political movements there. And if you could give it a little bit of hope. And I think with Germany, they just had a call this morning I think communicated there, the continued strength there to believe that they can step up a notch in terms of the growth of those businesses. So, I guess that sort of looking at some of the places, where they are important kind of developments occurring that will be a part of the lift.","James Murdoch","Yes. And Jessica, it\u2019s James here. On your other question look I think we answered this question in the past and I think I\u2019d answer it in a similar way. Today, we have made no secret of our belief over the years that we think that skies are strong together. But that said, currently our focus is on operating each of those businesses as best we can, each of the marketplaces that we operate in are competitive and are very dynamic. And we are seeing right now the businesses in very, very good shape. I think as Chase just mentioned, good growth in Germany, in Italy, I think the business is creatively very strong. And while the subscriber numbers are flat on an overall basis, that\u2019s really a \u2013 that\u2019s a good place to be relative to the last two years. And I think the churn numbers in particular are very encouraging. And in the UK at BSkyB I have seen good growth across the board with respect to all of our products as well as creatively what\u2019s being put on air. So, as to the larger picture, there no current or immediate plans and we are just focused on operating the business as best we can.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Jessica. Could we have next question please?","Operator","Yes. We will now go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. John, as we look at the free cash flow outlook for the company and particularly as everyone is focused on your leverage targets out in \u201816, can you just talk about the sort of pace of investment in content? I think the last two years you have had some pretty big negative working capital swings as you have gone into big production cycles. Does that unwind in fiscal \u201815? And should we see free cash flow snapback and then grow along with EBITDA? Can you give us any color on the sort of the pacing and sizing of these dollars, which are pretty big?","John Nallen","I don\u2019t want to give you guidance and forecasts on \u201815, we will do that in August, but directionally I can tell you, Ben we would expect to continue to invest, particularly in production and channels in \u201815. I think we were pretty clear many months ago about the fact that we are still building \u2013 2015, we are still building the year for three big initiatives in Fox Sports 1, FX, and mostly notably STAR Sports in India. So, I would see \u201815 as a year, where we will continue to invest in our growth maybe not at similar levels as \u201814, but we will continue to see investment.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","And you are talking specifically about through the balance sheet?","John Nallen","Through the balance sheet, yes.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Got it, okay. And then as a follow-up just picking up on that theme, maybe James can you just remind us as we think about STAR Sports what the next sort of investment with the investment cycle looks like from here? Where are we in your sports commitments and how long did those run and how are you feeling about the positions you have built from our rights perspective in that market?","James Murdoch","Well, I think, thanks Ben. First of all, I think we feel pretty good about the rights investments that we are making there. Obviously, we have a long-term agreement with the BCCI for domestic Indian National team cricket and that\u2019s really the sort of backbone of the cricket offering there. The Champions League Twenty20 is also a long-term deal and we have said we have been clear in the past that, that is a deal that we inherited in the ESPN STAR Sports transaction and is of a high cost. And then you have the ICC World Cup in cricket, which is a little bit lumpy, but I think \u201816 is really the big year of that. So, it\u2019s really after that, that you see that STAR Sports business in India starts to deliver meaningful growth to STAR India. Overall, I think the STAR Sports business in India is really coming along well. The integration has gone well in the last number of months. There were some time periods, where we could move the operations from Singapore to India and all of the new broadcasts have performed very strongly. So, we feel pretty good about it, but I think you\u2019ve got to anticipate, particularly in cricket rights, a reasonable cost continuing with the big one being in \u201816 with the ICC Cricket World Cup.","Operator","And we will now go to the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein","Well, hi, thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about domestic affiliate fees if I could. It\u2019s clearly one of the major growth drivers in your guidance next three years. And I am just wondering if you look at some of the specific incremental line items, like Fox Sports 1 or like FXX, specifically on the distribution side or like re-trans like which I guess is different than affiliate fees you can make a case for all of them. What I would love to hear is do we need to be thinking about any trade-offs there in terms of crowding out being able to get all of those things or have to make choices with your distribution partners on which things you prioritize or is it reasonable to think that you can make progress on sort of all of those initiatives at the same time?","Chase Carey","It\u2019s pretty clear. I mean, I think we expect to make headway on all the initiatives. I mean \u2013 and we have talked in the past again one of the things, I think we have tried to do is increasingly make sure every channel really is a channel that stands on its own two feet. I think if you go back a while and I would have said I think we had some niche channels or channels that in a world that has as many choices as this didn\u2019t have enough strength and wherewithal to sort of carry their own weight. And that sort of led us to re-launch a number of channels, which evolved into Fox Sports 1 and FXX and really to evolve our channels into sort of a handful of core categories around the news led by Fox News, Fox Business craving it out, FXX, which again I have said before, I think stands apart in the entertainment universe. Clearly, the uniqueness is sports and National Geographic, which is a brand that again resonates around the world.","So, I think what we have really focused on is making sure we don\u2019t have channels that are baggage, that are being dragged along by other locomotive channels that you have to make those trade-offs that we have channels that you need to pay or channels that have a real audience or have real strength and really can get fair value competitively for what they are in the marketplace and invest in those channels. We are not \u2013 I think it is important that we make those channels strong. I think leadership and hit programming continue to stand out and have the disproportionately important value and high value. And I think if we can create the type of distinctive hit programming we do at our Fox News or in FX, we think we should be getting fair value for those. And I think that is certainly the path we are on.","Todd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Chase, I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the domestic ad environment, what the stations maybe kind of pacing in the current quarter, also pricing at the network, cancellation options versus the prior quarter and maybe a year ago. And then on the cable networks you have a lot going on there with some of the new launches, so even just looking backward in 3Q domestically if you exclude the new launches FS1, FXX, the acquisition of YES, can you kind of give us a sense of core same channel ad growth and how it looks sequentially in the current quarter? Thanks very much.","Chase Carey","Let\u2019s just say I think in the comments about the ad market, in general, I mean I think nationally its okay. I mean it\u2019s sort of \u2013 again you still have which I think has been the truth for a while and continues to be a limited visibility going forward. And it goes up and down a little bit, I mean it was sort of down a little bit at the end of the calendar year and got a little stronger, got a little weaker, actually the last three or four weeks that gets little stronger. So I think it\u2019s been okay. It\u2019s not that we can call it robust. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 but it\u2019s an okay market. I think the local markets probably little softer, I would say the local market right now is probably sort of flattish. I mean you are not \u2013 I mean we will get some political spending as we get later into the calendar year. I mean you don\u2019t have a lot yet. But \u2013 so they are not that concerned, but I would say the local market is probably a little softer than the national market. But probably again sort of market being flattish, I think scatter is okay, I mean scatter pricing is okay. So I think its okay. Again you don\u2019t have long-term visibility to it. Fairly it\u2019s driven by some sectors, but particularly I think on our\u2026","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Cancellation options?","Chase Carey","Yes. I think on the options, again nothing sort of outside. I mean it\u2019s sort of pretty much business as it\u2019s been. I mean it\u2019s nothing sort of that of the ordinary either way that\u2019s \u2013 so it\u2019s just sort of in \u2013 sort of consistent with what historical patterns would be. I think in the cable market again we have got a mixed bag, so it\u2019s not always the same. Actually \u2013 I think that\u2019s actually been pretty good. And I think FX has continued to strengthen with the standout. I think Fox News had a nice quarter and on every level. So I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think on the new networks I don\u2019t \u2013 again I think our focus is not sort of \u2013 I mean look we want to maximize ad dollars, but our focus really is on the new networks is where they are going to be in two years not sort of what the ad revenue we can get out of them this quarter. So I mean it\u2019s not saying we don\u2019t care. The new networks would not be a material and just because of where they are in their life, they would not be material affecting our ad growth. I mean now they have advertising dollars and it will grow and it\u2019s important to us. But again the priority for those networks is really where do we \u2013getting them to the right place in the next couple of years.","Operator","And we will now go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Thanks. I have three very quick ones. James can you take over, I thought the World Cup for cricket was in \u201915, but it\u2019s actually \u201816 is that what you guys are saying?","James Murdoch","You are right you heard about at the end of fiscal \u201815. So it\u2019s just before the costs fall just at the end of \u201915...","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Cool, secondly Chase, the (indiscernible) weeks or days I mean we are getting some calls from clients and reporters about this passed into contracts and whether or not you are leaving, so given all you have said there about the future, can you just update on where you stand and with your own contracts?","Chase Carey","Sure, very simple. Rupert and I have an understanding in a new agreement. We have simply not gotten it on paper yet and the reason is focus on building the business, but we have a clear understanding of where we are going.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Okay. Thanks. And last is for John, if you look at your domestic cable expansions this year, they are really lumpy. So you have grown 21%, 16% I think like 10% now, if you look at the last quarter of the year, what\u2019s the right cable expense growth to think about for the last quarter given the YES deal is coming on as well, so where in the ballpark of growth should we think about it for the fourth quarter?","John Nallen","I think if you look at the first half of the year as you indicated, we had anniversarying some acquisitions from the year ago which increased the comparative cost base. This quarter you don\u2019t have that impact, because everything is like-for-like. So really to use that as the guidepost the biggest difference next quarter is the inclusion of the YES in cable. So I think that\u2019s directionally how you should think about the Q4 expense growth.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - ISI Group","Thanks. Just want to continue on the Cable expense especially when you look at it globally and with the new sports bets that are coming through, so if you sort of \u2013 you suggested that the long-term guidance is intact, can you sort of talk about the cadence of growth \u201814, \u201815, \u201816 at least on the cost side, obviously we know we will see what happens on the revenue side?","John Nallen","I think if you look, again we are not going to give guidance at this moment towards \u201815 and \u201816, but from a macro standpoint, as against \u201814 we will continue to invest in the new channels, Fox Sports 1, FXX and most notably it\u2019s something we have called out consistently a step up in STAR Sports, principally around cricket and most notably again, in that regard the World Cup. So you will see an increase in cost next year, focused on these big initiatives. But as far as the exact percentage in all of that, I think we will address that on our next call.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Alan Gould with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Alan Gould - Evercore","Thank you. Just wondering if you could breakout for us or give us some quantification of the magnitude of the SVOD revenue that you recognized this quarter in both the TV area and the cable network area?","Chase Carey","I don\u2019t think we would probably really get that granular on it. I mean, we did have a material SVOD event with the Amazon transaction in the quarter. So and I think the SVOD revenue because of when product is sold, probably is not going to be a constant quarter-to-quarter. So we ought to anticipate that, but \u2013 and it\u2019s a meaningful number. But I don't think we have sort of done really sort of breakout that type of segment-by-segment revenue for each of our businesses. But we did have a \u2013 it was a benefit to the quarter. But I think we feel good about where we are and we have that \u2013 we certainly have fundamental and a multi-year agreement in place that will continue to drive that. It\u2019s been an area of growth for us. We expect it to continue to be an area of growth. Amazon seems to be stepping up Hulu, it always done a couple of transactions, so it\u2019s becoming a more aggressive player in the marketplace. So we are certainly excited about that as well as potential broader developments in the overall market.","Alan Gould - Evercore","Chase if I can just follow-up on that, what inning would you say we are in, in terms of the SVOD market, do you think there \u2013 I mean how much growth is there ahead, general terms?","Chase Carey","I mean my personal view on it, I think \u2013 I mean I guess I do view in some ways the SVOD market as a subset of a larger digital marketplace. So I think if you really looked at just, you want to define the market as players that are in it today you certainly, there is lot of growth left internationally. I mean you got one player that\u2019s clearly got a leadership position in the U.S. in terms of Netflix, Amazon and Hulu certainly continuing to step up I think much earlier than maybe really in the first and second inning internationally. But I actually think there is really a proper way to look at it really in development of all these digital initiatives and digital offerings and I was talking about something like systems where FX essentially bought the SVOD rights and therefore FX is going to develop its own extensions of digital experiences around The Simpsons franchise and other products it owns. So I can give you sort of define it as a broader universe, I think you are in the early innings of the broader development of these digital franchises. But I think if you really define it narrowly you are obviously in the U.S. market you are further along. You are not in the latter innings, but you are set of along to define it in a very narrow context, but I think that\u2019s misleading. So I think this market will continue to evolve and I think it\u2019s one of the real opportunity that digital, it\u2019s because of the flexibility of that and the ability to do and try new things. I think things can evolve pretty fast. And I think that the opportunity that may not have been apparent a few months ago, that will of a sudden emerge and become a new opportunity to develop and monetize and exploit if you have the right content and brands.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Alan. Next question please.","Operator","We will next go to the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura","Hi, thanks. I have first for Chase, just along the line of \u2013 along the theme of digital in terms of ad support digital, I think when you look at all the delayed video viewing that\u2019s going on out there, be it DVR or let\u2019s say post three days, Hulu, the fill episode players, free VOD, I mean the pie of viewership could very well be expanding and higher than what it was in just the live viewership world. But when you just kind of look around at the ads slowdown that we seem to be \u2013 maybe the slight or modest ad slowdown that we seem to be seeing in the industry. I am wondering why this kind of delayed viewership uplift is not really monetizing as well as we might have hoped? And where do you see the biggest opportunity in terms of perhaps monetizing that digital uplift, if you will?","Chase Carey","Well, I think it\u2019s really simple. I mean, I think there is no question. The advertising side of our world has not caught up with the shift in viewership. And today, we are not measuring it close to well enough. We are not exploiting it close to well enough. We are not developing new technologies like targeting well enough. And to me, I mean, that\u2019s an enormous opportunity and challenge. I mean we need to clearly do a nice better job of monetizing this viewership and the viewership is clearly moving to a multi-platform \u2013 multi-device experience. And as we said, C7 is not the goal. I mean, C7 is just to me a very small step in the direction that at the end of the day has to get us to a place, where we can monetize every view on every platform. We can deliver this, the messages in a \u2013 in more valued ways, whether that means targeting or whether that means native or whether that means other forms of advertising messages that resonate with the consumer.","And if you want to talk about where we are in that game, we are not even in first inning as far as developing really the ad opportunities. So, I think what you are seeing is sort of \u2013 and to me, it\u2019s a glass half full. So, I do think the viewership is \u2013 the popularity of the product is stronger than ever, because of the ability to accessing all of these devices. And we are just not \u2013 it\u2019s all of us. We are part of that, not blaming others. We are part of the mix. We are not doing good enough job yet today to capture that viewership and monetize that viewership. And as we do it, I think there is an enormous opportunity, because we are obviously getting \u2013 our product, I think has never been more popular. Everybody talks about the shift of viewership at digital platforms alike and what do they want to watch on digital platforms is our content and our brand. So, we just got to figure out \u2013 we got to do a better job of capturing or monetizing the value with that.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura","Understood, thanks. And quickly, we get this question from investors a lot in terms of \u2013 and this is for either yourself, Chase or James asking is there anything about the political situation in the UK that in terms of political headwinds that would give you guys any relief and allow you to contemplate trying again to go down the path for BSkyB anything there that we should think about in terms of the regulatory environment in the UK?","James Murdoch","Look, it\u2019s James, I don\u2019t want to comment on the politics or anything like that, but the broader point is just we don\u2019t have any plans to revisit that anytime. Right now, there is no current plan to do that. So, it\u2019s not really worth kind of engaging on. But from a regulatory impediment perspective, I think as we argued a few years ago, we don\u2019t believe that there is one.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Anthony. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee","Thank you. So, one of your peers that operates at RSN in the Tri-State area said that there was softness in subscribers in the March quarter. So, I was wondering if you saw anything like that at all and if you could more broadly comment on the subscriber trend in your RSNs? And another quick question is senior executives from FBC were saying that they wanted to change the way pilot season goes. So, I was wondering if that has any implications on financials for the television segment and how does that change your upfront process? Thank you.","James Murdoch","I think in terms of subscribers, well I guess and say I don\u2019t know that we even have the numbers for March yet. So, I am not sure they even have that at least I don\u2019t think I have the quarter trends. I think the subscriber world sort of has continued to be pretty flat. I mean, I think that\u2019s sort of what it\u2019s been. And I think right now, that\u2019s sort of \u2013 I guess I am thinking over the last few quarters, but since the last 12 months, I think it\u2019s sort of a pretty mature market and then pretty flat market. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 and I don\u2019t think our RSN to be different than our other businesses. So, it\u2019s a general comment on it, not on RSN specifically, I don\u2019t have RSN sub-numbers specifically, but again I would say in general, it\u2019s pretty flat.","I think in terms of the comments on pilots, I mean, first, it\u2019s not financially driven. I mean, I don\u2019t think that comment was financially driven I don\u2019t think it\u2019s not going to \u2013 I think that what he was referring to would not materially change the financial plans for the business. I mean \u2013 and again, I think what he was \u2013 what I think he was referring to is really part of a general, which probably \u2013 in some place we have got, I think it\u2019s just a little bit different than it was meant, because we still make pilots. What just the broadcast business is operating within overly rigid set of rules in a world today that sort of has players operating opportunistically by whatever set of rules makes sense. And I think that was really the message and there are places where we will have a pilot to places we won\u2019t. What we said is that we are not going to have every show that sort of starts to be developed September with preps in order of pilots in the winter and then sit there and this time of year and look at all the pilots and big shows we put on the air in September. We will have some shows to do that. We will have some shows in the middle of the year when we have anyway the pilot just get a sense to the show. Some shows we really believe and we will order, we will go right to a straight order of 6, 10, 13, but \u2013 and I think we will do what makes sense, which in some ways is the cable business has done for us for a long time. And I don\u2019t think that was the message that we need to operate our business in a little lot more flexibility and agility and without the constraints for a decade to old rules and \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t really a financially driven statement and it wouldn\u2019t really change financial plan for the network.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Vasily. We have next question please.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, thank you. Just following up on your earlier comments on measurements a few minutes ago when Nielsen probably launches its cross platform measurement rating system, I was going to get a national list in ratings into the capturing viewership before it was monetized. I guess, do you think that might be a significant list? Do you think advertisers will give you credit for it? I guess any color on that would be great?","Chase Carey","Well, I think any of those changes are going to be sort of over time. I mean, they are not going to be, it will take time with any of it. I mean, you got a lot of parties involved in it whether that\u2019s to measure it effectively as well as to sell it as advertisers look at the bottom line with advertisers, we have to credit for viewership and there is value. And we are delivering that and we are really through it. And it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have to work through it with the advertisers, just as right now we are doing with \u2013 when we try to move from C3 to C7, it\u2019s the process we have to work through. I think everybody understands their issues around it that we have to address constructively, but again as I say that viewership has value. And we need to make sure we can monetize that value in a fair way.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JPMorgan","Just to follow-up on FS1, I think there was a cancellation of a show recently. I guess any sort of big picture comments, if you feel you are still on track to the guide you gave last summer or is it really just too early to tell given you have a lot more rights coming on board later this year and then after that you have a better picture of sort of where you are?","James Murdoch","Yes, sort of I think we have said \u2013 I said before, I mean FS1 is really something I think got to drive it a couple of years, not a couple of quarters. And I think we have said, upfront, there will be \u2013 I mean, the nature of building one of these networks, there are things that work, and there are things that don\u2019t. In reality, probably, more that don\u2019ts than dos and you work through that, you make changes. You take off things that didn\u2019t work \u2013 don\u2019t work and you have to launch new things or fix them if you think it makes sense to do so. Building a network is hard work and we have done it with \u2013 really most of our networks were built, whether it\u2019s Fox News or FX. And if you go back and look at it, usually the first couple of years or the Fox Network, I mean I hate to look at the line up \u2013 go back and look at the line up in 1988 or \u201887 of the original Fox Network. It\u2019s \u2013 you have got to fight through it. And that\u2019s \u2013 again, it\u2019s fully, yes, it\u2019s fully within our expectations and again, the \u2013 I think the issue is set and the real measure is where are we in two to three years.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim","Thank you. Good afternoon. Chase, you mentioned a focus on the development of over the top offerings, and I'm curious as to whether you're interested in participating in the personal subscription service that DISH has introduced and has Disney on board with. Is that something you're actively discussing participating in? And maybe more broadly, how do you think about protecting the ecosystem while still allowing some of your content to perhaps be used in over-the-top system? And then just John, if you don't mind, could you help us with the size of the impact of YES on EBITDA in the coming year and maybe also on earnings given some purchase accounting? That would be great.","Chase Carey","I am not going to comment on any one specific over-the-top offerings. I think in the general theme, I think we feel it's important for us to talk to any of the players that are expressing interest in developing over-the-top offering, and understand what\u2019s the opportunity there and how it makes sense. And I think one of the primary things we do want to focus on is the second issue you raised, which is, we are looking for \u2013 for us, if we're going to do something, it's important that it's enlarging the business, it's not substitution product, it's a product that adds and brings something new and value to the marketplace. There are a lot of ways players can do that, and I think if there are opportunities, then those are the ones we want to pursue, but I think it is \u2013 we are going to be disciplined about it same thing SVOD market emerge, and I think we felt that was important that we approach these opportunities in a disciplined way. That really makes sure we're enlarging the overall business for us, not just for hitting products undermine each other. So I think it is sort of goal number one to make sure these over-the-top offerings we are bringing something new and exciting to the marketplace, I think, and engage a consumer to do more or engage a consumer we don't have to today.","John Nallen","And then dealing with YES, as you know, it\u2019s really an addition to our portfolio of RSN, none of which we break out and give individual metrics on and with YES, we are not going to commence giving individual metrics on any one RSN, including YES.","Chase Carey","Thank you, Mike. Operator, at this point we have time for one more question please.","Operator","And our last question of the day will come from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in at the end. My question was also about the issue of measurement, and as we're in the digital upfronts now and TV upfront starting in a couple of weeks, there are a lot of new measurement products, really, very much on the market, Nielsen and comScore. I just wondered if you could talk about what is going on, specifically now, whether it's you guys or in the market in general, about actually adopting C7, how meaningful that would be to your ad revenue base, OCR for Nielsen or vCE for comScore, all these things which actually are here on the market now. How much can these actually make a difference in the upcoming cable and broadcast season?","Chase Carey","We are engaged with all of them. I mean, I think we want, I think we are frustrated in some ways, not that we don't have to do a better job ourselves. That array of these things and it isn't just measurement, it is kind of capabilities to delever more value through other \u2013 utilizing some of these capabilities. So, we're engaged with all of them. The opportunity is enormous. It's not to be enormous in 12 months. It'll grow over time, but you have clearly, a significant level of viewership and you look at the lift we get today, on some of our shows where we have the viewership is not on the linear network anymore I mean it speaks to the opportunity and if we can go beyond that and start to create VOD offerings that have in a field that attracts the consumer to them instead of DVR that sort of further extends our ability to capture whether that\u2019s a choice or recommendations or other experiences that enable us to drive viewers to find their preferred options from viewing programming in the sites of experiences we can develop for them that enable us to maximize the value of that content. But again I think all you need to do is look at the shift in viewership as it\u2019s gone to these platforms particularly on to selected shows. And I think that speaks to the opportunity that exists and again I don\u2019t want to misrepresenting, because sort of somehow this is in the next 12 months. I think it could be something that\u2019s additive in the next 12 months. But I think in the longer term it\u2019s a tremendously important opportunity for us.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","At this point we are out of time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","H. Reed Nolte","Thank you very much Ryan. Hello, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. On the call today we have Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer and James Murdoch Co-Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we\u2019ll give you some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to 21st Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The Company's Form 10-K for the 12-months ended June 30, 2014 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-K filing.","Please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release. Also note that the historical results for periods prior to June 28, 2013 described in the press release and on this call have been adjusted to reflect the separation that was completed at the end of fiscal 2013.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Rupert.","Rupert Murdoch","Thank you, Reed. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you very much for joining us today. I would like to start with some of the remarks and turn it over to John to review our financial performance. After that, Chase will provide an operational update before we move on to questions and answers.","Let me take a moment to highlight what we have achieved since introducing Twenty-First Century Fox to you at our August 2013 Investor Day. That day we provided a road map for how we intended to achieve industry-leading performance in the first fiscal year since our separation. We executed well against this plan, tackled challenges and continue to be focused on the strategic objectives we presented to you a year ago.","Financially, we just concluded this past fiscal year with the strongest quarter of the year. Our earnings growth this year has been broad-based. It has been driven by the themes you know well by now. Strong affiliate revenue momentum domestically and abroad, continued growth of retransmission fees, and increased content monetization.","Taken together, we found this quarter's confidence in our ability to achieve our fiscal 2015 and 2016, even as we continue to invest in our long-term growth. We are committed to delivering value for our shareholders, not only through earnings growth, but also through robust capital returns.","In that regard, yesterday, our Board authorized a new $6 billion share buyback program. It is effective immediately and will be completed within 12-months. Just as we have completed the $4 billion share buyback program authorized last August. We believe buying are own stock when it is underpriced represents a unique opportunity to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. And at these levels, we believe our stock is severely undervalued.","We have had a busy year considering and executing many strategic transactions. Transactions that will further about our ability to drive long-term value for all of our shareholders. We could not be more pleased with our recent agreement to combine our European satellite television holdings to create Europe's leading pay television business. With this transaction, Sky Europe will be poised for a new level of growth. With our 39% ownership stake, we will enjoy the benefits along with all shareholders.","Let me briefly address the topic of Time Warner. We made a formal proposal to acquire Time Warner because we viewed it as a unique opportunity with clear strategic benefits. Having been refused Time Warner's Management and Board to engage with us to explore this compelling offer, coupled with the reaction in our share price that undervalued our stock, resulted in our conclusion but this transaction was no longer attractive to Fox shareholders. As you know, yesterday we walked away. This is our resolute decision which is why we formally withdrew our acquisition offer.","Twenty-First Century Fox is an amazing company and our future has never been brighter. I am deeply proud of our businesses and confident and our ability to create growing value for our shareholders. Over the year, our team of outstanding executives, animated by our culture of entrepreneurialism, commercial acumen, and creative audacity has delivered outstanding operational performance and earnings growth, resulting in superior shareholder returns.","We look forward to building on that track record, while we remain opportunistic and nimble; we are a strategically complete company and have a clear sense of where we are going. To tell you more about our progress towards our goals.","I will now turn it over to John Nallen.","John Nallen","Thanks Rupert and good afternoon. As you will see in today's earnings release, we finished the year by delivering our strongest quarterly financial performance, which sets up very well to achieve our growth targets in fiscal 2015 and 2016. First, I will make a few comments related to our fiscal year results, then a more detailed review on the fourth quarter, and finally, on our outlook.","For the full-year, total revenues were $31.9 billion, up 15% over year ago levels led by double-digit revenue growth of the cable network and film segments and the effect of the full year consolidation of Sky Deutschland.","Total segment EBITDA for the year was $6.72 billion, 7% higher than the prior-year. This growth was driven by higher contributions from all of the company's segments with more than half of this growth generated by our cable networks. Our EBITDA growth was achieved, despite absorbing the 17% increase in total company expenses including our investment spending in the new cable sports networks and FXX, as well as the impact of the full year consolidation of Sky D.","Reported net income from continuing operations this year was $3.8 billion or $1.67 per share. And this included $174 million of income reported in other net. This largely reflects gains on the sales and investments, partially offset by the impact of the exchange revaluation in Venezuela.","Additionally, our full year results include gains of $134 million from participating in BSkyB's buyback program. Excluding the net income effects of these and comparable items in both years, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.55 compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.36 of 14% improvement year-on-year.","So now let me turn and focus on the fourth quarter results. As expected, the fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of the year, with 19% EBITDA growth driven by a 17% increase in revenues. On the revenue side, the increase by $1.2 billion to $8.4 billion in the quarter led by a 38% increase at the film segment and double-digit growth at the cable network and DBS segments.","Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.77 billion a $278 million increase over a year ago. This improvement was lead by record film segment contributions and double digit growth at our cable networks and this was partially offset by lower television segment contributions. Overall unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced our EBITDA growth rate in the quarter by approximately 2%.","This year\u2019s fourth quarter reflected the recognition of various tax benefits which reduced our overall effective tax rate in the quarter and the full year to approximately 25% as we previously indicated going forward we expect that our annual effective tax rate will be around the low 30% range.","From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations was $966 million this quarter or $0.43 a share. Making comparable adjustments to both years as we just did for the full year results, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.42 this year versus $0.32 in the prior year an increase of 35%.","So now let me provide some additional context on a few of our businesses as it relates to their fourth quarter performance. Let\u2019s start with the cable network. Total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 13% from last year, highlighted by a 16% increase in affiliate revenues and 9% advertising growth.","On the affiliate side, domestic affiliate fees increased 19%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and Fox News as well as with the benefit form the conversion and launch of our new channels FS1 and FXX. The consolidation of the YES Network also contributed to this increase.","Our reported international affiliate fees were up 8% reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 18%. Fourth quarter advertising revenue growth at the cable segments reflects domestic advertising increases of 12% lead by the RSNs and FX Networks. At the international channels, reported advertising revenue increased 5%, however, local currency ad revenues were up 15%.","Total cable segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $1.2 billion was up 11% over prior year levels. Our domestic channels results were up 17% reflecting continued strong underlying EBITDA growth at the RSNs as well as the impact of consolidating the YES Network.","Contributions form the FX Networks were below last year, but this was expected due to higher investments into FXX and the timing shift and expansion of original programming such as Fargo and Tyrant into this fourth quarter versus the third quarter a year ago. International channel EBITDA contributions were up 12% on a local currency basis, led by a higher FIC and STAR Entertainment contributions.","On a reported basis the international results were slightly below prior year, but this is due to the negative impact of foreign currencies. At our television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $145 million, as compared to $213 million in the prior year. This decrease largely reflects a 11% lower advertising revenues due to declines in general entertainment ratings, particularly, on American Idol.","Turning to our film segment, we reported record fourth quarter results with EBITDA of $339 million, nearly triple the $117 million contribution reported a year ago. This quarter\u2019s results several successful theatrical releases including X-Men Days of future of Future Past, Rio 2 and The Fault in Our Stars. Quarterly results also include increased contributions from our television production businesses led by the syndication of Modern Family.","Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $### million in the quarter, down slightly from last year as growth at Sky D offset the expected lower contributions at Sky Italia, from Sky Italia is higher-costs related to the broadcast of the FIFA World Cup. Year-end subscribers at Sky Italia of 4.725 million declined 30,000 from year ago levels. Sky D reported 3.81 million subs at the end of June, reflecting the addition of 360,000 net subscribers over the last year.","Now, before I turn the guidance, let me make a couple of comments on our cash flow and capital structure. We ended the fiscal year with $5.4 billion in cash and approximately $19 billion in debt. In fiscal 2014, we made a considerable investment on to our balance sheet for working capital and support of our growth. And we are expecting a similar investment level in fiscal 2015 after which we expect our working capital investment to normalize.","Subsequent to year-end, we announced the Sky transaction, which will have the impact of increasing our available balance sheet liquidity by approximately $5.5 billion and that\u2019s after factoring in the net cash to be received and the removal of the Sky D debt, partially offset by the reduced leverage capacity from the elimination of the DBS contributions. A portion of this increased liquidity is being used toward our new buyback program.","With regards to the buyback program that we announced a year ago, we've now fully executed that program and bought back $4 billion of the company's shares within the last 12-months. Similarly, as Rupert referred to earlier, we expect to complete our news $6 billion Fox A buyback authorization within the next 12-months.","So finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2015 total segment EBITDA growth and our outlook for 2016. The recently announced Sky transaction is expected to close during this calendar fourth quarter, after which these DBS businesses will no longer be reflected in our reported EBITDA.","Therefore, to eliminate any confusion, as we provide our EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2015 and our outlook for fiscal 2016, we are removing the impact of Sky Italia and Sky D for the entirety of each year in 2014 through 2016. As a result, recasting the reported EBITDA for fiscal 2014, the year we just completed, to remove the Sky contributions results in a base EBITDA of $6.29 billion.","As we indicated a year ago during our Investor Day, our growth in fiscal 2015 will be impacted by the continuation of several strategic initiatives. Most notably, the continued planned investments into our new sports and entertainment networks here in the U.S. and internationally, particularly in India.","Additionally, based on current rates, we are expecting adverse currency effects to impact 2015's growth, principally from Latin American currencies. The combined impact of these cable network investments and currencies will impact our fiscal 2015 growth rate by approximately 4%. However, the consolidation of the YES Network for a full year will mostly offset these impacts.","Considering these items and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are anticipating total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 to be in the high single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion base level for fiscal 2014. Again, this growth rate completely excludes the results of Sky Italia and Sky D and both 2014 and 2015.","The overall growth in fiscal 2015 will be driven by our cable segment, which excluding our DBS business represented 70% of our EBITDA this past year. This segment is forecast to post high-single to low double-digit EBITDA growth in fiscal 2015, led by contributions at the RSNs, Fox News and FIC.","This growth rates takes into account that cable segment expense increases in fiscal 2015 will be slightly higher than the 17% we reported in fiscal 2014. These planned expense step-ups are led our new sports channels. Most notably, from increased event costs at the unusually heavy cricket calendar STAR Sports in India, and the full year effect of consolidating the YES network.","Despite absence of the Super Bowl on Fox, we're expecting the television segment to post higher profit contributions in 2015, underpinned by continued increases in retransmission consent revenues and higher political advertising from the mid-term elections. And at the films entertainment segment, we're expecting fiscal 2015 results to be similar to the very successful 2014 levels.","So overall, our company is well-positioned to continue our planned growth trajectory in fiscal 2015 and to also achieve the fiscal 2016 target we presented to year ago. In our last earning calls we confirm that we are on track to deliver the $9 billion in fiscal 2016 EBITDA target. However now as we adjusted for fiscal 2014 and 2015 we need to recast that target solely to remove the impact of the DBS businesses. At our Investor Day, we forecasted at least a doubling of the DBS segment's EBITDA over the 2013 levels by fiscal 2016.","So removing that $850 million to $900 million of estimated EBITDA relating to the DBS business from the $9 billion target, yields our recasted target of around $8.1 billion at a growth rate over fiscal 2015 in the high teen percentage range. The acceleration in the EBITDA growth rate in fiscal 2016 will be lead by cable segments growth, including the return on the investments we have made into the new channels.","In fiscal 2016, cable segment revenue growth will be led by affiliate fee gains and expense growth at the new channels will decelerate since our new stepped up U.S. rights deals will be in their second year and there will be lower right costs at STAR Sports, due to fewer marquee cricket events. At our other segments we remain comfortable with our films entertainment outlook and our 2016 target reflects a realistic goal for improvement at the network and prices foreign currency earnings current rates.","So in summary, we had a strong finish of fiscal 2014 and we have good visibility into our most significant growth drivers which give us confidence in our growth plan to fiscal 2016 and beyond.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Chase for his comments.","Chase Carey","Okay. Thanks, John. As is evidenced in the financial review John just took you through, we feel great about the future of Twenty-First Century Fox as it is today. But before I get into addressing the progress we've made, I want to add a few comments to what Rupert had to say about Time Warner.","First let me be clear we are done. We pursued this potential combination to achieve one overarching goal, to create value for our shareholders. It became increasingly clear that the combination of the drop in our share price and the highly defensive nature of Time Warner\u2019s actions is going to lead to a transaction where too much of the value created in success went to Time Warner shareholders.","Second, this initiative was one of opportunity, not necessity or defensive concerns. We feel great about the future of Twenty-First Century Fox. We have a great combination of industry-leading franchises, emerging growth businesses, and international leadership. We are confident we can successfully prosper in a consolidating distribution world because our powerful content and brands will continue to be the sweet spot in our industry. Our confidence in our future made the thought of issuing our stock anywhere near it's current price simply untenable.","Third, we have no plans to pursue any other third-party content company as an alternative to Time Warner. We've created shareholder value at Fox by being an industry leader in building businesses, realigning franchises and establishing leadership positions in brands and contents around the world.","One the most important traits that distinguishes us from our peers is that we are a growth company, we build new businesses, we are market leaders in areas of opportunity like the international markets. Our story is one that balances growth with appropriate return of capital to shareholders. We are already lean so we can grow profits by pursuing exciting opportunities. There are many opportunities for us to continue to build on that strategy. And that will be our priority.","Finally, we hope this decision will reaffirm our commitment to building value for our shareholders. Our decisions in recent years regarding splitting the Company, exemplifying the Company through both sales and acquisitions, realigning key businesses, as we recently did with the Sky entities, and our increased return of capital to shareholders are all driven by the singular goal of increasing shareholder value.","Now, a few comments on our operations. Let me begin by adding a bit of insight to the 2015 and 2016 guidance that John just outlined. We recognize that our projected earnings have a bit of a hockey stick curve to them. This curve is largely due to our domestic and international new channel initiatives, particularly Fox Sports 1, FXX and STAR Sports, which require investments in 2015, then turnaround to be a tailwind to growth in 2016.","The underlying growth of our core business, if we exclude these new channel initiatives is actually both stable and strong. Excluding these new channels, we would have solid low-to-mid level double-digit growth in both 2015 and 2015. In fact, that solid double-digit growth would carry through into 2017 too.","Importantly, as these new channels continue to grow, it will provide us the long-term growth and profits that really distinguishes us from our peers. We made good progress with these channels both in terms of distribution and advertising growth and expect viewership to grow heading into fiscal 2015, as key content like the Major League Baseball Playoffs, U.S. Open Golf championships, FIFA Woman's World Cup and Sprint NASCAR cup races, premiere on Fox Sports 1, and the iconic Simpsons within excess of 500 episodes begins its run on FXX with an expanded slate of original content.","At STAR Sports we launched our new Kabaddi league last week to great success with an audience 10 times the recent World Cup and we have a lot more to come. At our established U.S. cable businesses, we continue to build on our leadership positions. For example, this season 12 MLB teams on our RSNs have ranked at the top PrimeTime programing in their respective markets.","At Fox News we continue to see new shows like The Kelly File and The Five, grow to complement our established franchises and become market leaders in their own right. The network shows continue to dominate that cable news competition with The O'Reilly Factor, Special Report and Fox and Friends, all remaining number one in their respective time slots for over 100 consecutive months.","At FX, we continue to lead the way with high quality diverse programming and like Fargo, The Strain and Tyrant, which truly put FX in a class by itself. Further underscoring our U.S. channel strength, we successfully completed affiliate renewals during fiscal 2014 at or above target. At this point nearly 95% of fiscal 2015 and 70% of fiscal 2016, U.S. affiliate revenues are underpinned by agreements in place with the balance representing an opportunity to accelerate.","At our international channels, FIC continues to perform well, despite the currency efforts John discussed, expanding, in particular, the sports business across all three major regions. Our ongoing strong growth at STAR India enabled us to finish the year with our highest ever share at over 20%, driven by Hindi entertainment and our regional language portfolio.","At our broadcasting group we continue to be opportunistic in key markets as illustrated by our recent strategic station swap, picking up to San Francisco stations, including the market leader in exchange for ones in Boston and Memphis, further optimizing our ability to monetize retransmission revenues and our NFL rights.","At the entertainment network, we obviously have some challenges to this year but we feel very good about the future. We advanced key strategic initiatives like year-round development and event series and have a promising slate of new fall series, including Gotham, Red Band Society, Empire, Utopia, and Gracepoint.","More importantly, we are excited about the recent appointment of Dana Walden and Gary Newman as Chairmen of our new Fox Television Group. As creative executives, Gary and Dana are simply unmatched in the industry. Moreover, the closer alignment of our network and studio will enable us to maximize opportunities for those businesses to work together, while continuing to pursue business with third-parties.","Business at the recently completed up fronts would best be described as cautious. We hit our targets in terms of pricing but overall volume was down. Many have asked to what extent this result was driven by advertising moving to digital platform. Now, clearly digital ad spend is growing, particularly in mobile platforms. However, television effectiveness standing up pretty well to the competition.","The primary factor leading to lower upfront volume was the lackluster economy, leading advertisers to make the decision to rely more on the scatter market and keep dollars in their pocket at the upfront. Consequently, if our programming delivers on its ratings potential to scatter market is an area of opportunity. Longer term, we need to better monetize the expanding viewership on digital platforms. The move to seven day measurement and improved VOD experiences is a step, but we have a long way to go to better monetize this viewership.","We're also thrilled by the recent success in the theatrical side. The outsized performance of small budget films like Grand Budapest Hotel and Fault In Our Stars served as perfect complements to our global franchise films like Rio 2, X-Men Days of Future Past, and most recently, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. We believe the feature film business has exciting growth potential and we look forward to upcoming releases like Gone Girl, Exodus, and our next installment of Night at the Museum.","Finally, as you know, we successfully reached an agreement with BSkyB to combine our European satellite platform to create the continent's leading pay television platform. Each of these businesses is performing well. In Germany, we continue to add subscribers and add new subscriber experiences. In Italy, we successfully renewed Series A Soccer with expanded exclusivity, while continuing to achieve improved efficiencies and improving and adding to the overall consumer offering.","Nonetheless, we recognize there was an opportunity to take these platforms to another level by putting them under one roof hence the Sky transaction. We are quite pleased with our 39% ownership in this platform and have no plans today to change that position. Our focus will be on helping the platform achieve its full potential. ","In summary, we are immensely proud of what we achieved over the past year and even more excited about the opportunity we have over the next two to three years to take our business to a whole new level. Our sole focus will be achieving that goal and ensuring shareholder value grows with it.","Now I would now like to open the call to Q&A or turn it back to Reed for that purpose.","H. Reed Nolte","","Thank you Chase. Ryan we would be happy now to take question from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer-Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Thank you. It is a two part question on the same topic. Thank you for addressing the Time Warner situation clearly. I think it would be helpful for your shareholders to hear what it was about Time Warner that made it compelling to you from an acquisition or merger perspective and why now. Just to get a sense of your thought process. Related to that, use of cash, John, you guys laid out last summer leverage goals for the end of FY16 and with Sky deal you almost made it harder for yourself to reach those. Could you give us understanding how you think about those targets now? And a multi-year framework for thinking about either buybacks or capital returns to address that? Thank you.","John P. Nallen","","Sure I guess in the first \u2013 and I don't want to get too far into it, again, I want to be clear. We have moved on. So I don't want to be dwelling on sort of a transaction that we moved on from but I'm happy to provide a little clarity. I think at its core, there were a handful of things that were compelling and it really was the unique opportunity which is why you know wanted to be clear this isn\u2019t the case where we move on to another target. We like our business, and we like our future and where we are at.","But I think what made Time Warner unique in the benefits that come out of it for a couple of things. I think first, I guess it sort of highlights three. One, clarity in scale this matter. We have got enough scale and we got a unique enough brands and content to navigate the world we are in, but I think there were opportunities to sort of you know to further emphasize that by having putting together the breadth, brand and content and certainly it would have been more with them in place.","I think second there is real optionality that came out of the ability to mix match the assets and then what we've done \u2013 some of that \u2013 we created to Fox Soccer to pick up speed, we turned them into a broad-based general entertainment channel and a broad-based sports channel. I think as we looked that the array of content and network opportunities, whether it\u2019s in sports or kids or general entertainment, news, non-fiction there are array of places to mix and match content networks that we would have had across that portfolio that we thought really gave us opportunity to build on that.","And I think important all this probably would have been particularly true internationally where clearly the markets are not as developed. I think probably third is a little bit longer term that there is no question this business continue evolve at all these digital platforms as the emerge again here in the U.S. and overseas. The manners and options in which content is going to get packets, people access it, that content gets monetized for advertizing alike is all clearly gone above and grow and I think the breadth of what we would have had would have given us what it provided a unique opportunity to really create those next-generation of experience is a business is off the back of it.","You know I think hand-in-hand with that was the fact we thought these businesses were pretty good mirrors of each other. This wasn\u2019t a tech Company buying a content company or two companies were familiar with each other. In many ways businesses look pretty similar. I think it gave us confidence and the ability to manage and navigate it. And really enable us to create skill in almost every place, whether its TV studio, Film studio, say the entertainment networks, sports, kids, news, non-fiction that they really were pretty good mirrors of each other and therefore really created scale advance and again I want it clear, we are very \u2013 we have a leadership position in scale that just obviously took it to another level.","So I think it was those combination of things, but you know it really, they don\u2019t make sense, I want to go to it and pursue it on terms that enabled us to crate value for our shareholders, we like the hand we've got and really intuitive you know this was enhancing value for shareholders.","And obviously, as we said, we made the judgment that wasn't going to be possible. So we thought the right deal of right things pursue and focus on the opportunities. We obviously have been focused the last month we got the Sky transaction done we made some senior management changes. So it\u2019s now like we have and continue to build the businesses that we've got in hand and that\u2019s always going to be priority one for us. Was the question?","Rupert Murdoch","","Yes, just on the balance sheet and where we stand?","John Nallen","","And I guess in terms \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit I guess it\u2019s going to be a little bit like back we were two years ago. And I guess, I think probably the guidance we gave back then isn't that different in terms of what we think is property returns leverage cash and the balance sheet and the like. I think use of capital or no different and I think where we can invest in organic growth or sort of opportunities that fit within our portfolio was Rupert said I think will be ourselves strategically complete.","And I think in that certainly return on capital it\u2019s an important part it. We maybe $6 billion \u2013 and we recognize at $6 billion buyback does not and to itself get us to the balance sheet we\u2019ve talked about and so it\u2019s a \u2013 on going working progress and we will continue to address it as we go forward, but sort of guidelines we have before really still largely the guidelines and we will certainly work and focus on trying to drive ourselves to that place, but this does obviously great excess liquidity on the balance sheet we note that.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much.","Rupert Murdoch","Thank, Ben. Next question please.","Operator","Comes in the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony J. DiClemente \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Thanks a lot. I think, John in your remarks about the guidance, you talked about despite the absence of the Super Bowl, you expect television segment to post higher profit levels in 2015. Just wondering, what gives you the conviction that the television segment can turn it around? What types of ratings performance does that imply for the broadcast network? What gives you confidence that Dana and Gary Newman can achieve those types of ratings requirements to get there? Thanks.","John Nallen","I guess, I\u2019ll address I mean first in the entertainment network is not driven by growth in the entertainment profitability if the entertainment network. We have \u2013 Gerry and Dana but obviously there \u2013 this is \u2013 this business as you build over years not months. We are excited about the year and we feel great about the shares we gone place, because that we launch the number of initiatives, but we are not expecting anything dramatic in terms of turnaround, this year profitability perspective, everything I think our profitability entertainment sectors actually in probably down a touch what its driven by, clearly, political spending of soft that some of the Super Bowl upside and probably first and foremost retransmission continues to be up, an increasing important underpinning approach for the broadcast business overall.","Anthony J. DiClemente \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","","Thanks. And then just if I may, one quick follow-up on housekeeping. If you can give us in the quarter at the cable segment, domestic advertising and affiliate ex the impact of consolidation of YES? Sorry if you did -- but that will be great..","Rupert Murdoch","","I did, Anthony, if you look at it that way, the affiliate growth we reported at 19% domestic would be in the low-double digits excess and the ad growth that we reported to 12% would be in the mid-to-high singles.","Anthony J. DiClemente \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.,","Thanks a lot.","H. Reed Nolte","","Thank you, Anthony. Ryan next question please.","Operator","","Comes from the line of David bank with RBC capital. Please go ahead.","H. Reed Nolte","David, you\u2019re out.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Sorry about that. A little mute button. ","Rupert Murdoch","","It is that hi-tech stuff.","H. Reed Nolte","David, you may still be on mute.","Rupert Murdoch","","Maybe we come back to him later. Try someone else?","H. Reed Nolte","Operator are you there.","Operator","","Okay, sir we had a technical difficulty. One moment for the next question.","H. Reed Nolte","Okay.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. I guess following up some of the prepared remarks. Your approach on the Fox side as opposed to News Corp has essentially been build rev then buy. And totally hear what you said about Time Warner being a unique opportunity. But it does beg the question -- is then indicated, what you do with the excess liquidity because you know that you will always from here on the constant speculation that Fox is a buyer of anything that could be for sale. So I was just hoping you could address, if you were interested in buying other assets, would the focus beyond more content? Do you think there is a chance to consolidate midsize players? Or is the focus really just to build internally?","Chase Carey","","We build ourselves. You look all of our best businesses we have started them ourselves. And we are very happy with that. We are not, you said buying anything around. We are not going to buy anything around at all, if there was something very unique, but small, I don\u2019t know, I would say never, but we have no plans to go out on the acquisition trail.","Rupert Murdoch","","I mean I guess I really would disagree with your premise. We had as much liquidity, if not a bit more a few years ago and I think docked at ourselves pretty consistently. We believed this was a unique opportunity. To end up saying, to look at it as a final set of broader strategy I just think flat out wrong. We think was a one time opportunity unlike anything else I think our actions over the last few years when we have had this liquidity speak to how we conduct ourselves.","I think the fact that we felt there was potentially something here and in some ways like this obviously a big acquisition, but in many ways I think the level of the core this was building. What you are going to have with this content was really a scale and a branded content that let you build the next-generation of similar experiences in business is on these digital platforms and there isn\u2019t anything else like that.","So I think I am not saying we wouldn\u2019t find the Bolton on every time, they built on things that get within our portfolio we have some opportunistic things that we looked up they bid inside what we do and that\u2019s how we operated the business and that\u2019s how we expect to continue to operate the business and I think that the fact that this one transaction we got presented to you. we think opportunities doesn\u2019t really shouldn\u2019t anyway shape or form be taken as any sign of that shift in how we are going to drive these businesses, mange these businesses and operate these businesses. I would last three years were or a better sign of what we are planning to do.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Thank you. That's very clear. And just completely separately, you highlighted the RSNs as a big driver throughout the call. Can you tell us what length of your sports contracts are now? And the outlook for RSNs for the next year or so?","Chase Carey","","I'm when you think on average they sort of average about five or six, five actually John was saying seven I was going to say five or six that\u2019s a little longer. I mean there are always a couple coming up, we are actually pretty good renewing, we just extended that cavilers.","H. Reed Nolte","","The LeBron.","Chase Carey","After the LeBron arrived we've got a couple we\u2019re well engaged in now, obviously we recognize complexities in navigating the space. There are places we will decide as it makes sense for us as we did with the Dodgers in LA. They are pretty long-term. I think we feel pretty good about where we are with those agreement in aggregate.","H. Reed Nolte","","Thank you Jessica. Ryan can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go back to the line of Data Bank with RBC capital. Please go ahead.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","All right. Let's try this again. Are you there?","Chase Carey","","Yes, we are here.","","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good. Got the hard part done. First question, more specifically for Chase, could you talk about how the dialogue with respect to reverse comp has evolved over the last year or two? Could you give us a sense of where you think things our shaking out and where they have come from? Secondly, for all of you, how do you think about -- it's been a year since you've recapitalized Hulu with your partners. You've gotten a lot more traction on the programming front, I think, since the recap domestically. What is the international strategy for Hulu? How do you think about how you're going to use that asset internationally? Thanks.","Chase Carey","I think in terms of \u2013 I mean on a reverse comp, I don\u2019t want to get too deep into the sort of really what our discussions that we have with our affiliates, the basic premise is pretty simple, in the world we are in today and we've said it before, we believe you know you need to do a revenue stream and its actually we need to get build revenue stream for every household we deliver our content to and our most valuable content is the network content.","When we have an O&O we can get to build revenue streams directly through our owned and operated stations, when its going through an affiliate there is the affiliates between us and them and the payments of that subscription side of the revenue stream. So we negotiate with the affiliates up front what we think is appropriate share a fair share for us to receive for the programming we provide to them that they in turn go on and negotiate with distributors to characterize for it.","And in this world the type of unique content certainly led by the sports content we provide those affiliates, have an increasingly disproportionate value which is why we said retransmission and reverse compensation, probably continue to be the most under valued of any of the content that is distributed in the marketplace. So it\u2019s an ongoing process to try to move that closer to what is fair value. Obviously we are nowhere near; they don\u2019t want competitive basis fair value for it.","In terms of Hulu, I would say our focus in Hulu are not domestic, I mean its \u2013 they realistically \u2013 I mean down the road you know maybe but Hulu went though [indiscernible] really good job putting a new team in place with him, I think he has really started to make an impact in the market. He seems to be more active in the last set of months, but I think his priority is and focus is to build scale at Hulu in the domestic marketplace and from there we will see where it goes from there, but that is the priority of it.","H. Reed Nolte","","Thank you Dave.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much.","H. Reed Nolte","","Ryan next question please.","Operator","And that comes form the line Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Hi thanks, I'll refrain from the urge to ask you about liquidity and buyback for the 20th time. Let me instead \u2013 start on something you've hit a couple of times, which is notion of long-term digital opportunities in the changing consumption environment. You have mentioned on your own you have a lot of assets to bring to bear. You just made a huge investment in The Simpsons. You have this growing platform of FX Now.","You just talked a little about Hulu, which is a little bit separate. Would love to hear your thoughts -- with your own assets, how does that get monetized in the near term? How does that come together in the long term? What is the pace of investment versus pace of growth? Now that you have dismissed the Time Warner aspect of that, how do you look at that from your standpoint going forward? Thanks.","Rupert Murdoch","Well, I think simplistically its point clearly in working progress and digital platforms are going to be tremendously important part of our future, particularly the mobile ones and I guess everybody talk about almost like competing with us and realistically the content we \u2013 the content brands we have probably the context in the brand that are most in demand on these platform.","So I think there in a ways we will explode it some of that is through complementary experiences that complement or core establish business in FX now that complement but FX exist in places they can move to be it some up more independent, certainly Hulu which we have \u2013 obviously much more independent and autonomous we obviously participate in it licensing product to other.","So you know its not only wholly-owned in operated certainly we have deep relationships with Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and the like I think we do those things with care to make sure all of those businesses can exist, but I think we see growth opportunities in each and everyone of those from ones that are extensions, ones that are or more new platforms, platforms that we owned part of and third-party platforms that are all part of the mix.","And I think added on top of that which is really part of this whole digital experience his how do we then \u2013 how do we really starts up monetizes viewership not just monetizes \u2013 not just sort through payment strains but you know the question, the viewership already talked about sort of what\u2019s happening viewership going and many of people are watching is much of products \u2013 watch again more and more places and we got to catch up with sort of the ability to figure how do we monetizes and capture the value inherent in that viewership and some of that to measurement, some of that\u2019s true technologies like targeting, some of that\u2019s being smarter of advertising that makes an entertaining khanate of advertising and the like.","And all of these things, we're clearly just at the start of. I think it is all going too evolved and we need to realistically compete and develop those opportunities, both in terms of the content packaging, the content experiences, the types of content extension that come off of it, as well as monetizing all of that viewership at every level. It is all important.","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","","Got it. I will reserve my follow-up for another time. Save it for somebody else. I know we are late in the day. Thanks.","H. Reed Nolte"," ","Thank you, Todd. Ryan, next question please?","Operator","","Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael B. Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I will just do one. This is to Chase, James or Rupert. I would argue, and I think you'll agree, that last year you guys had scale and before you guys had scale. What has changed now you think need more scale? Is it consolidation of cable, the rise of SVOD? Given strength of your business what made you search out greater scale?","Chase Carey","Let me make it very clear and I thought and I said, we don\u2019t need more scale. I mean I think it doesn\u2019t mean \u2013 there are opportunities created by having more scale, but we have industry-leading scale in terms of brands and content. This was an opportunity to add a unique portfolio of the brands and content what we have, but we do not need given very successful navigating it realistically. We continue to be highly confident in the ability to do so.","Michael B. Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, FS1, there was some concern on FS1's first year and you cited all the new sports right you would bring up next year. I would you rate the FS1 launch and at what point should we evaluate it? Do we have to wait a couple more years make a judgment on it?","Chase Carey","","Yes, I think going in I mean I think we said from the get-go, so it\u2019s not new. You\u2019ve got a measure these new channels. They are hard to build. Things will go right, things will go wrong. It takes two or three years to sort of build the channel. Particularly even something like sportswear and a variety of core properties that will be sort of the foundation have not even launched yet on FXX, we haven\u2019t even launch Simpson yet, we are still ramping up in terms of originals. It\u2019s all of what takes time. I mean, like everybody, I think forgets where Fox News was two years and our FX was five years and sort of\u2026","Rupert Murdoch","","I\u2019ll just add to that it took seven years for Fox News to turn a profit. And, today its making $100 billion is it. These things take time.","Chase Carey","","I think we feel \u2013 I think we have been thoroughly before and I think we are pretty sanguine about challenges are doing and I think we feel good about where we are, but I think we were realistic going in, where we probably would be. And, as I said building a channel its hard work we don't delude ourselves. But, we've made a lot of headway, we built critical foundation in terms of affiliate agreements and continue to refine the programming. So, we are really where, essentially, where we thought we would be and we feel good about the track we are on.","Michael B. Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC","","Thank you","H. Reed Nolte","","Thank you Michael, Ryan, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go head.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","","Thank you. Chase, you gave some color on the ad market. How different is the environment between say domestic cable the Fox Network and TV station advertising, from a demand perspective? Are you seeing any relative improvement between the three? ","Chase Carey","","Yes there its always little I mean there were some different I mean and I wouldn\u2019t say no, in sort of the high level I would say not say I mean \u2013 I would not do the ad markets certainly robust at any level. In the summer you're always a bit of summer doldrums so it\u2019s a little tough to sort of get it to really too fine tuned on the ad markets when you are sitting in the summer. I think as you get into the fall, you will have a much better sense of it.","I think I'll clearly cable and broadcast from a volume perspective had people keeping money in their pockets. I think locally and obviously don\u2019t have that the upfront dynamic in the same way I think the local market is probably right now for the quarter is tracking to be down at touch for the September quarter couple of the local sectors that I think is important, telcoms and autos probably look a bit soft for the quarter, but its it like to be a bit stronger but its okay. I think, overall, you find it certainly a place for everybody and use more cautious and I think that probably truly I mean in the local you got a little bit more sort of day-to-day activity with people the upfront creating little bit longer dynamic in the national market for broadcast and cable.","H. Reed Nolte","","Thanks John. Ryan I think we have time for one more question please.","Operator","And that comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead","Michael C. Morris \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions with respect to what you would have acquired had the Time Warner transaction taken place. I think that HBO and some national sports rights, both of which were unique. You addressed this a little bit before about digital rights. HBO clearly is very unique in that it is a premium network and also really probably has the potential to be in the over the top platform as well. Do you see yourself investing or building organically a similar product now?","In addition to what you have something that\u2019s a premium product and something that could be a global over the top platform that s unique. And then in secondly the national sport right, obviously, the NBA comes it would been something that the perhaps you would been in is part of this deal does it change your approach perhaps being more aggressive in bidding for the NBA. Thanks.","Chase Carey","","And I guess in the first in terms of unique content, I think the right way I guess to respond is in two ways. I mean in some ways as they talk about digital \u201chey look we have a great portfolio of content brands and I think these digital platforms will evolve and will be part of it just from I think how do you continue to package and offer product, I mean in some ways people have said to what degree is Netflix a different version of \u2013 you know the version of HBO without the linear channel.","You know Hulu as it evolves is it offering an array of premium original content without a linear channel and I think these digital platforms will provide an array of opportunity to package products. I don\u2019t think \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean we are talking about goals that can create \u2013 HBO but I think there are opportunities to take unique products I mean in many ways look FX, you know I think probably is second and on in terms of creating unique distinct product and I think a real established brand in the marketplace.","And I think we will have opportunities and we will continue to develop and explore them is how do you take advantage of these emerging platforms here and abroad, obviously we have just some unique strengths overseas and some unique businesses overseas to get it built on Asia, Europe and alike. That will give us opportunities to develop and expand and build on new things.","I think in terms of sports, I mean sports, we've got the portfolio, I mean right now we've have got the rights in place to build FX \u2013 you know build Fox Sports 1 and develop it along the plan we laid out. You know we have the rights we need to be successful, I think we will look at, you know I think as we should we will look at it whatever rights come up and if there is better rights we think that fits and we could reach agreement on that would increase the value of FX1, we\u2019ll engage on it, but we have a sports portfolio that lets us fulfill the plans we had for FS1 so I think anything we add to it would be sort of opportunistic to take it to a further level.","Unidentified Analyst","Great thank you.","H.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Shortly, I\u2019ll provide some context on the financial results we just announced, but first, I want to update you on our pending transaction. [We\u2019re](2:42) making steady progress. Ten days ago, shareholders of both Twenty-First Century Fox and Disney approved all proposals related to the combination of our film, television production and international businesses with Disney\u2019s exceptional assets.","In addition, Twenty-First Century Fox shareholders approved proposals necessary to effect the spinoff of our portfolio of news, sports and broadcast businesses to create the New Fox. It is pleasing to report that our shareholders overwhelmingly endorsed our recommendation of this transaction with over 99% voting in favor. Shareholder approval is a key milestone towards the deal completing. In late June, the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox. We are now focused on obtaining regulatory approvals outside of the United States and on track to close our transaction in the first half of calendar 2019. We are confident that our businesses and brands will continue to flourish as part of Disney. As our shareholders will have meaningful ownership of the combined new company, we are focused on delivering these unique assets to Disney in great health.","Additionally, progress in forging the New Fox as a stand-alone entity has been substantial. Anchored by the number one news channel across of all of basic cable and a sports network that captures 40% of all NFL viewership, the New Fox will boast the schedule of America\u2019s most engaging sports news and entertainment programming. In particular, I want to focus on the news and live sports brands that will underpin the strategic strength and robust financial profile of the New Fox.","Our cable network portfolio continues to be led by the strength of Fox News, which, this quarter, maintained its position as the number one cable network. Also, the Fox Business Network achieved its highest rated year ever this past fiscal year. In fact, the Fox Business Network beats CNBC in the business day for the past 14 consecutive months, and Fox News has been number one in total day and total viewers for 25 months straight.","Equally as impressive, FOX Sports had its highest viewership ever in calendar 2017 on the combined strength of our sports programming across the broadcast network and the cable networks, FS1 and FOX Sports 2. Live sport is clearly the most valuable content in our industry, and FOX Sports is the leader in live events. We are thrilled with the performance of our first FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup, which set new viewership marks for non-U.S. matches in the Group Stage round of 16 quarterfinals and semifinals, all despite the absence of the U.S. national team and a challenging time difference between Moscow and the United States.","In addition to exceeding our financial expectations, the World Cup also vaulted FOX Sports 1 ahead of ESPN2 in total day viewership for the calendar year-to-date and puts FOX Sports 1 on track to achieve a fifth straight year of growth in total day viewership.","Looking forward, the launch of NFL Thursday Night Football in September will enhance FOX Sports' already dominant position in television\u2019s highest rated programming. Fox\u2019 38 regular season NFL windows will be the most ever on a single network, and Fox will command approximately 40% of all regular-season NFL viewing.","We also expect that our NFL will account for three of television\u2019s five highest rated programming -- programs of this fall and that AMERICA\u2019S GAME OF THE WEEK will remain TV\u2019s number one show for a 10th consecutive season. So in summary, we are pleased with our momentum as we plan for and stand up the New Fox. And as we make this progress, we continue to be focused on the entire operations of Twenty-First Century Fox, while we move towards closing our transaction with Disney. And with that, I\u2019ll hand over to John. ","John Nallen","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We finished the fiscal year with a very solid fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue, EBITDA and core EPS growth while setting us up very well for fiscal 2019. I\u2019ll start with some brief comments on the financial results for the full fiscal year, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter. Total full year revenues were $30.4 billion, up 7% over last year, led by an 11% increase in worldwide affiliate revenues and a 10% increase in content revenue.","These gains were partially offset by 3% lower advertising revenues, primarily reflecting the absence of the Super Bowl, which was broadcast last fiscal year. Excluding the Super Bowl, total company advertising revenues increased 2% over the prior year. Total full year segment EBITDA was $7.03 billion, down 2% from last year, as 10% growth at the cable segment was more than offset by both difficult comparisons of the Television segment, where the prior year included the Super Bowl, a record-breaking World Series and a national election cycle as well as the impact of incremental investments in our direct-to-consumer and FoxNext initiatives.","Income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $4.5 billion this year or $2.41 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.97, 2% higher than last year. Now turning to the fourth quarter. Our total company reported revenues were $7.9 billion, up 18% over last year, reflecting double-digit revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $1.91 billion, a 32% increase over the $1.45 billion reported a year ago, led by higher contributions from the cable and film segment.","From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders was $925 million or $0.50 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of 58% over last year. So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Cable networks EBITDA of $1.61 billion was up 12% on revenue growth of 14% and expense growth of 15%. Domestic cable revenues increased 9% overall, led by affiliate fees growth of 11%, supported by higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and increased subscribers.","Domestic ad revenues increased 1%, reflecting the continued strength of Fox News and the impact of the FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup on FS1, partially offset by lower results at the RSNs. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues, partially offset by increased costs from the World Cup and more original episodes at FX. Reported international cable revenues grew 25%, led by advertising growth of 55% and a 12% increase in reported affiliate revenue.","The sharp increase in ad revenues was led by the highly successful debut of the IPL tournament on STAR Sports. Reported international EBITDA increased 53%, led by higher contributions from both STAR Sports and its entertainment business. At the Television segment, EBITDA was $106 million, 23% below last year and principally reflects approximately 20% higher programming costs due to the broadcast of the Men\u2019s World Cup and higher entertainment programming expenses from increased original programming.","Television segment revenues grew 14% on advertising gains of 12%, led by the broadcast of the World Cup and higher entertainment pricing and 19% higher retransmission consent revenues. Turning to the film segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $289 million, a $311 million improvement over last year driven by significant film studio contributions this year from Deadpool 2 and The Greatest Showman compared to a high level of releasing costs last year to support that higher volume of summer films.","In addition, television studio contributions increased this quarter, reflecting a higher amount of content available on SVOD platforms. The growth of the studios was partially offset by further investment in the launch of the Marvel Strike Force mobile game at FoxNext. Now these strong overall P&L results generated over $2 billion in cash from operations this quarter and $4.2 billion for the year. That\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019 strongest cash generation result ever.","And from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion in cash and $19.5 billion in debt. Looking ahead, there were a few meaningful items to note as we start our next fiscal year. At our TV segment, we will broadcast our first season of Thursday Night Football. While we expect this property to be value accretive in the aggregate over the five-year life of the contract, early on in the cycle, we anticipate losses as we begin to fully optimize these rights from a revenue perspective.","Also at the TV segment, we\u2019ll continue to see increased retransmission growth and incremental local political advertising associated with the midterm elections. Within the cable segment, we expect to generate at least mid-single-digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth for the full year. And on the cost side, you should expect an increase in international cable expenses in the fourth quarter associated with broadcasting once every four years the ICC Cricket World Cup at STAR.","Foreign exchange is always an item to be mindful of, where we\u2019re currently seeing the U.S. dollar continuing to rise against the Indian rupee and some Latin American currencies such as the Argentine peso. Now I\u2019ll remind you that, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we\u2019re expecting our normalized effective rate for fiscal 2019 to be in the mid-20% range.","Now to finish off, just a little housekeeping on New Fox. Our current plan is to file a Form 10 with the SEC in the late fall, which will provide historical and pro forma financial information and other details on New Fox. We will not be communicating separate financial information nor forward commentary on New Fox until that filing is cleared by the SEC.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and thanks for joining us today. So as you just heard, in fiscal 2018 and particularly in our last quarter, the company delivered strong financial and operational momentum really across all the businesses. And much of this financial strength is driven by the growing value of our cable networks brands in the marketplace. We just delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit domestic affiliate fee growth, reflecting subscriber increases in both digital MVPD services and our younger underpenetrated channels. These gains more than offset declines in traditional subscribers.","For Twenty-First Century Fox in the U.S., we have more subscribers today than we did a year ago. And in fact, for our networks that are carried on all virtual MVPD services, revenue from subscriber additions on those services are now exceeding revenue declines from subscriber churn on traditional platforms. And these achievements, I think, are part of a growth strategy and a business agenda we\u2019ve executed against really for the better part of the decade. The Disney merger and separation transaction we\u2019re getting to the finish line and the value they unlock for shareholders clearly underscore this point.","Turning back to our fiscal year. I\u2019m particularly proud of the creative excellence and unique experiences we delivered to customers across our businesses. We\u2019re pleased with the turnaround of our film studio, which delivered a solid performance by any measure. It led the industry in awards, including the Best Picture Academy Award for Fox Searchlight Shape of Water, and on top of this, we ended the year with the box office success of Deadpool 2, which has exceeded $730 million in worldwide receipts.","Our television studio has three shows that were number one on their respective networks and four of the top 10 new dramas of the broadcast season, 9-1-1, The Orville, The Gifted and The Resident, driving multi-platform audience growth for entertainment on the broadcast network. At STAR India, the addition of the 60-match Indian Premier League on STAR Sports has yielded dramatic results.","The tournaments are almost a 30% increase in viewership over last year and the target audience on TV. Average match reach and engagement has increased by double digits, 15% and 30%, respectively. We also saw the IPL dramatically increase viewership on our Hotstar mobile platform. To give you one data point, with 10.3 million concurrent live viewers during the IPL final match, which was the most concurrently watched live digital event in the world ever.","So in closing, we\u2019re excited by the performance of the business and the growth we\u2019re seeing and the prospects for the future. Reed?","Reed Nolte","Thank you, James. Now operator, we\u2019d be happy to take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First, we have the line of Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. I was just -- I guess, my overarching question is on your OTT plans and if you could just give us an update on Hulu, just a bit the loss trends. Have losses peaked at this point since maybe they\u2019re starting to improve just slightly? And if you can just outline for us what you think about for Fox News and FOX Sports and Fox Broadcast for OTT and how FX+ is going, that will be helpful. ","Lachlan Murdoch","I should first talk a little bit on the sort of media plans with Fox, in particular, how it would relate to businesses that will end up within New Fox. And then, James, you might want to talk about our existing kind of substantial over-the-top businesses elsewhere in the company. We announced several weeks ago that the Fox News will be launching a direct-to-consumer offering called Fox Nation towards the end of this year. We\u2019re tremendously excited about that as our first direct-to-consumer offering for Fox News.","We \u2013 there\u2019s tremendous excitement about it and interest in it. So we\u2019ll be seeing that towards the end of the year around the time of the midterm elections. Currently as well, within Fox, we have a very large within FOX NOW authenticated business for all of our channels, which, as we go through this transaction obviously, we\u2019ll be separating with National Geographic and FX coming off of that FOX NOW platform. James?","James Murdoch","Yes. And well, first of all just on Hulu, look, we remain very, very enthusiastic about the prospects for Hulu, and I think we and the other partners in Hulu are eager to invest and continue to grow the platform. But beyond that, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give you guidance on where exactly that\u2019s going, but the volume growth is very, very strong. And we\u2019re very excited about that business and the sort of dimension that it adds to the overall company.","And then sort of more generally with respect to direct-to-consumer businesses, I mean, you\u2019ve seen our affiliate, Sky, continue to grow well; the incredible strength in Asia, particularly with Hotstar at India, which is the mobile direct-to-consumer over-the-top business. And we think it\u2019s been a real core competence of the company and one that has put us in good stead as it invested in content and this \u2013 the digital sort of vertical integration has really paid dividends for us.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jessica Reif of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jessica Reif","I guess, two questions. On your programming that\u2019s sold to third parties in like downstream, Fox Film, I guess, I think is still with HBO. Fox TV product is, I guess, sold to multiple players. What is the plan? Is your plan to \u2013 well, can you tell about the timing of HBO? And would your plan be to eventually put that on the Disney direct-to- consumer platform? By how long will it take to regain those rights? And on Fox Network, the news and sports strategy is really clear. Can you just go a little bit about what your entertainment programming strategy is? Will you build from scratch your own program production? And will you buy? Can you talk about ad sales and the structure as you go through this transition? Thank you.","James Murdoch ","Jessica, it\u2019s James here. The, I think \u2013 first of all, I think the agreements that we have for the pay one window for the movie output with HBO goes well beyond our expected closing of the Disney transaction, so that\u2019s really a matter for a later day. And with respect to the television production, we have lots of partners who will help us and who really create these programs. We try to find the best result for the program and the best result for us and our partners in terms of finding a home in terms of downstream licensing of that. Sometimes, that\u2019s the best thing to do that is in- house. Sometimes it\u2019s to seek partnership elsewhere, which we\u2019ve done in some cases, where it\u2019s clearly the right strategy. So we remain flexible and open-minded around what the right thing to do with each program and with each of our partners is.","Jessica Reif","And then, Jessica, to your second question on the entertainment strategy on the network, clearly, we have a heavy investment on sport and as John mentioned, in the early years of the Thursday Night Football coverage, and that deal, it is an investment and a significant investment for us. And the reason we chose to do that is really around the incredible promotional platform that gives us not only for sport and for news but also for entertainment.","And so if you look at the night, if you think about sort of next year when we also have WWE on Friday nights, you actually have a schedule in the fall. We are only programming entertainment Monday through Wednesday and Sunday nights. And I think that gives us an incredible opportunity and honestly an incredible advantage in terms of how we can really focus our programming choices onto those nights assisted by really the country\u2019s best promotion platform in our sports lineup. ","James Murdoch","Thanks Jessica.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson","Lachlan, following up on that question about investments you\u2019re making at the network. Can you talk us through maybe the retrans cycle you have over the next two years to recoup that investment? And how co-terminus are the deals between Fox News and the Fox station? So just give us a sense of after you dig that hole on spending, how does it come back on retrans in the following years.","Lachlan Murdoch","Michael, thanks for the question. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I should go into sort of detail in terms of these kind of commercial negotiations and how they\u2019ll play out over the next couple of years. Clearly, I assume it\u2019s pretty obvious to you that we do calculate the value of retrans into the programming and acquisition deals that we do. And I presume it\u2019s also pretty obvious that in our long-range plans we are seeing or we expect to see significant step-ups in our retransmission revenues.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ben Swinburne","Just back on STAR. James, can you just \u2013 now that the IPL is behind you, fiscal 2018 is behind you, how did that perform financially for the company? I don\u2019t believe the ad sales growth covered the license fees. So were you able to recoup that in higher affiliate revenues? And did you hit that $500 million target we\u2019ve been talking about for a while at STAR? And then just for John on the guidance.","I think you said retransmission revenue growth would accelerate in 2019 versus the \u2013 what happened in 2018. Just wanted to go back because you had a nice increase in the fourth quarter in retrans growth into the 19% range from, I think, more like double digits earlier in the year. So just wanted to ask can you clarify your expectations for retrans growth in fiscal 2019.","James Murdoch","Thanks, Ben. The \u2013 so with respect to the TV business EBITDA target of $500 million, we got there or thereabouts. Obviously, as you know, there was a big investment in the Hotstar platform, and that comes through in our international cable numbers. But we\u2019re very pleased with the growth. And I think on the IPL, no, it was a very successful for us, and the advertising returns were very strong and monetization across the board there.","So really, the impressions that were delivered by the IPL was so much higher than what Sony delivered with its previous ownership of it or its previous broadcast really fell to the bottom line. So the sports business was very strong, and we\u2019re excited. I look at lineup in terms of the overall growth of affiliate income in India. Really, the strength of the sports business with the IPL would be CCI and this year with the ICC World Cup coming up and continued strength in Kabadi. It\u2019s a \u2013 I think at second quarter, I think we\u2019re in a good position there.","John Nallen","Yes. And Ben, just housekeeping on retrans. What I said was we expected increase \u2013 continued increases in retrans from where we are this year. And look, we got out of the business of guiding on individual places, but we\u2019re comfortable that the growth rate we had in the current year is still something that we can get next year.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Ben. Operator, please next please.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to the line of John Janedis of Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Janedis","Thanks. I\u2019ve got two short ones as well. One is you spoke to the strong acceleration in domestic affiliate revenue, John, but I assume the sub growth helped. But anything else to call out there? And based on your outlook, should we assume that you have less in terms of renewals this coming year? And then separately, I think you guys spoke to the increased SVOD revenue. Was that more international than domestic? And with the Disney direct-to-consumer offering coming, do you have a preference to sell on a nonexclusive basis to free up content for the platform?","John Nallen","Let me cover the detailed parts of that first. Now so the key driver during the year and in the quarter was price, and it was great to see in the fourth quarter volume being a contributor, but on a \u2013 just an overarching basis, price was the main contributor to growth. From an SVOD revenue standpoint, domestic is still our largest market by far. So you should take out of it that the increases that we got in the fourth quarter and that we experienced for the year were much more heavily weighted toward domestic streamers than they were toward international clients. And the part of the \u2013 second part was \u2013 John, what was the second part of the SVOD question?","James Murdoch","Oh, licensing nonexclusivity.","John Janedis","Offering coming \u2013 exclusivity versus nonexclusive given I assume that they like to have some of that content freed up to the platform.","James Murdoch","Well, look, we just had, as Lachlan mentioned earlier, 10 days ago the shareholder vote here, and we\u2019re moving toward the close as we said in the first half of next year. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 we haven\u2019t been and we won\u2019t be getting into any gun jumping around trying to guess what comes next. We\u2019re trying to operate the business on an as-is basis as effectively as we can.","Reed Nolte","Great. Thank you, John. Operator, this time we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Lastly, we\u2019ll go to the line of Barton Crockett of B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.","Barton Crockett","Okay. Great, thank you for taking the question. I guess, I was interested in what you\u2019re seeing about the political kind of environment in terms of political ad revenues at your TV stations and the political lift that you might see at Fox News given the kind of hyper-charged environment we\u2019re in and the great momentum that they have. What\u2019s your sense of how that plays out for you over the next coming months?","Lachlan Murdoch","Sure. We expect \u2013 well, the political market today is certainly strong and strengthening. And if you look at this, looking forward sort of for the entirety of fiscal 2019, we have competitive Senate and house races in 15 of our 17 markets, and we have gubernatorial races in 16 of our 17 markets. So we are expecting very \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give the number but a significant political revenue season flowing into our local stations. And as \u2013 in fact, we were talking just before the call started just in terms of the strength on political that we\u2019re seeing at Fox News as well. So we\u2019re very pleased when we look at the political market.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Barton. Thank you, everyone, for joining today\u2019s call. Please note that due to the pending merger with Disney, we\u2019re not expecting to hold a conference call with investors in connection with our first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release.

Please go ahead sir.","Joe Dorrego","Thank you very much operator. Hello everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer and Steve Tomsic, our CFO.","First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and fiscal year and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox, financial performance, operating results, strategy among other things. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and actual results could differ materially from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today\u2019s call and the company\u2019s SEC filings including the company\u2019s registration statement on Form 10 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings which are available in the investor relations section of our website.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lachlan.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront, very successful. We're making good progress on our distribution renewals, and we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions as well as we can commence our first full fiscal year 2020.","For fiscal 2019, we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth. Our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues.","As you all know, about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue. And despite continued subscriber declines, we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. Renewing distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us, and we have accomplished these renewals without much clamor over many cycles.","This past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates particularly in the television segment successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising.","In fiscal 2019, we achieved 10% growth led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the Fox Stations Group surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama Romney election.","A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues led by 46% growth at FOX News.com alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy. This year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports, and news. Specifically for Fox, this strength reflects advertisers recognition of our unique capacity to deliver a highly, engaged audiences at scale.","Across our concentrated portfolio, we were rewarded for our continuing content investments. On the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top-of-market, low teen CPM increases, and mid-to-high single digit volume increases.","In addition, we were able to command mid-to-high single digit pricing increases in sports and news. In addition, even at this early date, we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing, we are seeing for the Super Bowl. We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in primetime and sports programming, which is clearly to our great advantage.","As you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the Fox broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content, as well as by local programming, delivered every day across America. Our network commands premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates, because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content genres that engage wide audiences.","From the NFL to The Simpsons, the network is defined by its programming breadth, and not by a vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels. And it is this breadth of programming that makes the Fox Broadcast Network one of the top four channels across the country week in, and week out and such a strategic asset for Fox.","While the power of sports is undeniable, we are not looking to turn Fox into a pure play sports channel. We have a few of those already; rather keeping the Fox Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on. It is why we are investing in entertainment originality at the network at a time when broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams, as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront.","To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of own content, to generate long term asset value for Fox. We are being strategic and judicious, building smartly, and deliberately around our strengths.","As part of the strategy, we are pursuing a new program co-production model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network. We are enhancing our internal content creation capabilities to the launch of sidecar, which is already providing third party platforms like Quimby [ph] with content. And also through the acquisition we announced yesterday, of Bento Box, the animation company that produces \u201cBob's Burgers\u201d as well as two new Fox series, Duncanville and the Great North.","Bento Box gives Fox access to the next generation of animators, and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long term value for the company. You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule, where we have launched more animated hits than anyone, to know that animation has been the most stable network programming on Fox. Bar none creating leverage, loyalty, and youthful audiences across linear and digital properties.","Beyond the network, we are also focused on our direct-to-consumer initiatives Fox News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel, and has a strong position in direct-to-consumer news offerings. The Fox News, digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month, and lead news engagement with over three billion page views per month.","We are expanding our D2C news capabilities by offering a more immersive video-on-demand service in the form of FOX Nation, which was launched just this past November.","On the sports front, we launched Pay-Per-View boxing, with the Spence, Garcia bout in March. We followed that with the Pacquiao, Thurman match just a few weeks ago, and we're encouraged by the results, as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the Fox Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first Pay-Per-View event.","In aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people, and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. But, our progress does not stop there.","During the past few months, and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands beyond their traditional linear business models, and deliver new, and innovative products to our most valuable asset, our massive and massively engaged audience.","Most notably in May, Fox and the Stars Group announced plans to launch Fox Bet, a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States. We are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season, or I should say before the upcoming football season, and we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long term value contributor to Fox.","Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement for the proposed acquisition of 67% of Credible Labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States, at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics, including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next three years.","The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with a special committee of independent directors of credible [ph] board, which has unanimously recommended the transaction.","Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will access an adjacency to our enormous national and local news audiences, and tap into a high growth market. Just like our investment in the Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering through Fox Sports, The Credible marketplace is comfortably adjacent to, and enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those of Fox News Media and our local television stations.","Upon the approval of a Credible deal, you will see us activate the Credible marketplace across Fox Business dot com, which we\u2019ll be refreshing later this year, and across the fast growing digital footprint of our FOX TV stations.","Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe, that given credible access to a highly engaged digital audience, will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note, that we plan to ensure that Credible can continue to operate under its founder, Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category.","From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The Fox News Channel dominates the cable news landscape marking 17 consecutive years as the number one cable news network and maintaining its position as the number one cable network in both primetime and total debuting this past year.","FOX Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events, measured by minutes viewed, beating second best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC.","With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcasts of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season, and we're confident, we can build on last year solid ratings growth.","Our Fox Television Stations will continue their multi-year expansion of local news coverage, and will collectively produce nearly 1000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the station group to become number one in the locally programmed and highly profitable daytime, day part in our owned and operated markets.","We're also looking forward to the addition of 50-weeks of WWE Smackdown, starting on October 4, a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of two seasons of \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d our Own The Fall, sports lineup across the network and our sports channels, and of course the broadcast of Super Bowl 54 on Fox.","In support of our growth, and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020, as we plan to deploy approximately 200 million to 250 million of EBITDA to launch, to the launch of the WWE, the Fox Entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably Fox News and Fox Business.","We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth, and value in the long term. We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses, and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands, and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about.","But before I turn over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks, filed against Locast last week. \u201cSimply put, Locast is a rogue streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more,\u201d","Locast claim to be a non-profit that is not operating for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. It operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance to the company of our Fox network and our owned and affiliated station group. We're confident in the merit of our claim against Locast.","The Locast theft is of course a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands, and the content that they carry. Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results.","Steve Tomsic","Thanks Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a standalone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.","Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year, as well as the fourth quarter along with providing some financial markets for the future. Our full year results saw total revenues grow 12% to $11.4 billion Our revenue growth was broad based with affiliate revenues increasing 12% led by retransmission revenue growth of the television segment.","Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5 percentage points of advertising revenue growth, coupled with the record year of political advertising at our television stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we were also encouraged with our digital progress, with digital advertising representing close to $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenue.","Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year reflecting 8% growth at the cable segment, and 24% growth of the television segment.","At this point, it is worth remembering that when looking at our full year fiscal 2018 numbers, as well as the first three quarters of our fiscal 2019 results, that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve out basis.","As such they include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs, in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past, understate the costs required to support Fox as a standalone business. We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formulaic [ph] Lee allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 million and $250 million on an annual basis.","Illustratively, if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account, they would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million. Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both these absolute values and the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs.","Turning to the fourth quarter, total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion up 5% over last year reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million a 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the television and cable segments.","This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which now more properly reflect the full cost of operating as a standalone public company. From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 a share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over the last year.","These reductions principally reflect increased interest in income tax expenses from our operating as a standalone public company. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid 20% range we expect to have going forward.","So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Networks EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth at 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3% supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by net decrease in pay television subscribers.","Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1% reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year, as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year. The ad revenue decrease at the National Sports Networks was partially offset by the continued strength of Fox News, led by digital and advertising growth.","EBITDA at our cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a stable cost base, as digital investments at Fox News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup, and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter.","At the television segment, EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior quarter reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022.","In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8% reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections, and more FIFA World Cup matches.","When viewing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches and NASCAR races in the quarter, as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter.","A strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property plant and equipment, of over $800 million in this quarter, and $2.3 billion for the year, representing 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow respectively.","And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt.","Looking ahead into fiscal 2020, there are a few key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability, the single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl 54 in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective will largely be neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events such as an off cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game, and the absence of the FIFA World Cup.","As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2, P&L results this coming year will be impacted by high sports expenses and networks, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts, and the addition of WWE rights, as well as lower political -- political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year.","Looking across our group wide other revenue category, we expect to post solid revenue growth in our cable and other segments supported by the increase in Fox Nation subscription revenues. The expansion of our Pay-Per-View boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our L.A. Law. Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our television segment.","As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a standalone public company for the full year as compared to only one quarter in fiscal 2019.","On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid-to-high $300 million range. This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021.","From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million resulting from the tax basis step up obtained as a result of the Fox Corp.Spin, while our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new broadcast center in Phoenix.","Before concluding, I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investment, strategic M&A and shareholder returns of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared a second semi-annual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our annual shareholder meeting in November.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe.","Joe Dorrego","Thanks, Steve. Now operator, we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] We first turn to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","MichaelNathanson","Thank you. I\u2019ll ask to John or Steve. Okay I'll feel awful.","John Nallen","I can make him hard.","MichaelNathanson","Okay I'll give you two then. I was trying to be kind. So the first question we look at the cadence of facility growth at Cable, it decelerated from 13 to 11 to 4 to 3. And the questions people have new companies what drove that deceleration? And we look ahead to the new fiscal year, what's the cadence of 38% of the new deals coming due, to maybe reaccelerate that growth. And that's one. And I often feel is I get the Bento Box acquisition, but why is why is Credible a good fit for you, like what expertise you bring to it that perhaps we\u2019re missing from the outside?","John Nallen","Right. I'm not sure you'll start with Steve on the..","Steve Tomsic","Michael on Cable, I think as we mentioned at the Investor Day the way we see affiliate, we see it in the round. So the split between cable and television is less relevant to us, because we negotiate all the contracts in one bulk group. And so we would -- we finished Q4 versus Q4 with a plus 7% growth rate across the whole state. And so, we would anticipate that sort of growth rate at that level or above into fiscal 2020.","The reason why Cable has sort of reduced sequentially over the quarter through the fiscal year is just comps to just lapping deal maturities. And so, as we go into new deals, the focus obviously will be in getting fit -- a greater share fair value on our retrains. So you\u2019ll see a disproportionate level of the forward growth still being within the television segment as opposed to the Cable segment.","MichaelNathanson","Great. And then on -- on Credible and happy to talk about it. We as a management team are very excited extraordinarily excited about the opportunity that Credible affords us. We look at it, and I think you know we've talked about this at the Investor Day and since our key assets is not our skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling, you know affiliate revenue, although our teams are extraordinarily good at that and those are businesses that as you've seen in these results are performing extraordinarily well. But really our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in news and in sport and entertainment with our audiences.","And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear analog environment to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to demonetize that engagement in new models. So that really let us earlier this year to the Stars Group, where we decided with sports obviously entering the sports gaming market was a tremendous which is a huge long term opportunity for us. And the correlation between obviously the sports audience and this is should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports betting audience is extraordinarily high correlation. And so, you know you could say getting into the sports betting arena, is a no brainer.","Well, it's equally a no brainer, with Credible in the news category. If you look, and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on us over the last couple of months. If you look at our news audience, and I'm not just talking, on cable news, but importantly the nearly 1000 hours of local news that we produce each week. If you look at that audience, it correlates incredibly highly with Credible\u2019s target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience and news which is natural, our skews are slightly older. It skews towards homeowners and it skews towards an educated audience.","And these are all factors that people searching for mortgages in particular, and refinancing loans skew heavily towards. And so, when we saw Credible, we could see that by combining their service, with our audience and our digital platforms first, with Fox Business, and then later through our other news platforms we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward.","Joe Dorrego","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Hello. Lachlan, I wanted to come back to the comment you made around digital advertising at $500 million growing healthily. Can you give us a little more color on what, what is that business? How much of it may be video versus display? How sustainable you see that growth rate being especially as you head into what would be a political, an elevated political year next year? Because obviously that helps sort of insulate the overall ad business to grow across the company.","And I just want to ask if you had any update for us on the process in evaluating the buyback plans as you know that's a big focus for investors particularly in the back of some of the acquisitions you've announced.","Lachlan Murdoch","On the on the digital advertising front, we're very pleased with its growth. We think, we can aggressively push it even further if you look at you know that it's over 200 million unique users of our digital products, and as I mentioned sort of 10 billion views.","If I take for instance just that I'm at FOX News.com You know we are now often doing over 100 million page views per day. I mean, yesterday, we did a 90 million page views in a day which was a slow day for us then. But we certainly think we can we can monetize those page views. We built out the sites and the content, more aggressively and faster than we've built out our monetization of those views. So we expect to push them further.","Steve Tomsic","And Ben, just to pick up on that. It's a pretty good spread, where we get our digital advertising revenue from across Fox News and the entertainment side of things both directly and by Hulu digital video views as well as [Indiscernible]. So it's a good spread from where we get it from but, we think that sort of the front of the tip of the spear in terms of growth will continue to continue to be Fox News going forward.","John Nallen","And Ben, it\u2019s John on the question on the buyback. The as we said at the Investor Day, the Independents were spending time with their advisors. We expect as we did then, that there'll be a conclusion and an announcement around the buyback framework just around the time of our annual general meeting. There's been no change to that that timetable.","Joe Dorrego","Operator, can we go to the next question?","Operator","Next we turn to the line of Jessica Reese Erlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","JessicaReeseErlich","On advertising, Lachlan, it\u2019s very helpful to get that color on how you did in the upfront. It's so strong, what are the drivers besides lack of ratings in the industry in general. And can you talk a little bit about how you're selling differently with everything under Marianne's umbrella, is everything across platform now?","And then on the gaming, can you give us some color, of factors to consider on how this will ramp? Is it all dependent on state by state legislation? What else will drive it? How quickly can you ramp? Thank you.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, Jessica. So on advertising, look we estimate this is the strongest advertising upfront in 17 years. So you know, it's extraordinarily robust. Our result, we've had certainly in both in both pricing and in in volume. You know pleasingly, the scatter market since the upfront has been even stronger. And we are in scatter doing double digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront. So, which means if you do the math, we're in the low 20s pricing in scatter over last year. So and this is driven really you know across categories. So it's not one category that's driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms, we start to take their advertising digital platforms.","Pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause, as they work out some regulatory demands, around the advertising so that they weren't initially, they were slow in the upfront and then came back in and strong and they are particular strong and scatter now pharmaceutical. Finance has been strong. And even now, locally and this goes partially to your second question, on a state-by-state basis in a couple of our local stations notably, New York and Philadelphia we're seeing some of this gaming our revenue begin to appear in a fairly significant way.","So we think from a gaming point of view, as more states legalize, online gambling, that we have a tremendous revenue stream to us outside of the TSG partnership, but just from a local advertising point of view.","Also obviously and the Super Bowl. We start to sell the Super Bowl, and we're very pleased with the Super Bowl, both from our pricing point of view in terms of where we are, versus our last Super Bowl a few years ago.","Then your second question, Jessica was on, was on Gaming and the TSG partnership. Steve, go ahead.","Steve Tomsic","Yes. I think, that the ramp of it, Jessica really is dependent on the state by state legislation and having that open up or liberalized, and so that really drives the actual sort of operationalization of that within the joint venture in terms of opening up that state access.","But in the meantime, we obviously have a partnership with brand royalty and all the rest of we'll have a most positive impact on our P&L through the course of this year.","Lachlan Murdoch","I should say one of the things we're going to do is as mentioned before, the football season begins, we'll be launching a National free-to-play game, which is which is legal across the country and in every state. But certainly, we'll hope to put the brand out there and begin to establish the business.","Joe Dorrego","Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","And next, we turn to the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Oh, thanks so much. Steve, you mentioned a very robust free cash flow, and you also mentioned 85% conversion for the full year last year. Should we take that 85% to be consistent with very robust? And then Lachlan or John, Fox Nation has come up a few times on this call and I think it was mentioned that growth in subscriptions was a driver. Any context you can give us around sort of size and scale of that business where you think you can get it to? And as subscription subscribers is that the right metrics we should be looking at?","John Nallen","Thanks, Doug. So I mean free cash flow is I think 85% probably a bit toppy from what we expect to convert this kind of fiscal year we\u2019re in. And the thing that will be a bit of a drag versus where we've been over the last quarter is being essentially the build out of the Phoenix Broadcast Center, which I think, I said at the Investor Day we expect CapEx to be sort of low to mid-single digits revenue. And this will put us at sort of the higher end of that.","Lachlan Murdoch","On Fox Nation, Fox Nation is performing really very very well. It is still early days, having launched only this past November. But as a subscription video-on-demand service, certainly subscription is the first part of that name, and so it's clearly a metric subscribers that we are watching closely. We haven't really spent any external marketing dollars on it. And the assumption that we will spend an appropriate amount of external marketing is within the EBITDA investment that Steve has spoken about earlier, and that will begin in the fall.","The pleasing thing is that the conversion rate to trials to paid subscribers is extraordinarily high. And if we can maintain that conversion rate while widening the funnel of trials in the fall it will be extremely successful business.","Joe Dorrego","Thank you. Can we go to the next one?","Operator","And next, we turn to the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","Thanks. I have two questions. Lock, when you brought up Locast, so I just want to ask you, can you walk us through the timeline now that this is filed, what's next? And then I understand a permanent injunction was requested, not a temporary one. I'm just curious as to why that was?","And then, second for Steve, with your capital allocation policy, is there a certain percent of free cash flow that you're sort of setting aside each year to specifically allocate to M&A, or is what you're investing in truly just opportunistic as things come up? Thanks.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you very much Marci. And I'll turn over Steve for your second question. On Locast, I am -- I flushed out as much as I could what I could say in my kind of prepared comments, and I hope, I was punchy enough. I tried, I tried to be, but on legal advice, and seeing of this case is now sort of before the courts. I'm better off not to add anything to those comments. But Steve\u2026","Steve Tomsic","Yes and Marci, just on capital allocation. We're going to stay flexible. We will be balanced, but we're not going to have a strict percentage of free cash flow that's dedicated to M&A. We'll be looking at, we'll assess opportunities across organic. And then I and also \u2013 this use of capital in terms of returning an amount to shareholders, and sort of review that periodically. But the notion that we would dedicate to X percent of our free cash flow is not the way we'd operate.","Joe Dorrego","Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our final question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you so much. Lachlan, if you could maybe talk generally about the soft ratings that we've seen in the news network business, really the last couple of months not just obviously Fox, but just across the industry, what you attribute it to, is news fatigue, and I guess how quickly do you think it can turn around?","And then on the subscriber side, I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but if you gave us some decline number, and maybe a little color on how different these negotiations are you know now that you don't have the [Indiscernible]?","Lachlan Murdoch","I'll answer the last part first, which is they're there easier. But starting from the beginning. New ratings are softer when you compare them year-on-year. Historically though, I think they are still incredibly high. We are in an extraordinary news cycle. And so you know Fox News has lost less ratings, or less audience relative to our competitors.","And so we continue to be obviously number one and expect to continue that run for quite some time. I do think though, there probably is some news fatigue. But I also remember this time last year, we were also in an extraordinary news cycle. We are incredibly pleased about the hard work of the people at Fox News has continued to keep. You know they're not on their primetime lineup, but they're you know all day our ratings are in the position that they are even despite having some talent shakeup. So we are really pleased with the performance of Fox News.","In terms of sub declines, you know overall we're seeing about a 1% subject aggregate, sub decline, so that includes our kind of growing, sort of smaller networks, such as Fox Sports 2 and BTN. So we\u2019re down and aggregate numbers of subscribers just about 1%. But if we look at the market, and we have to sort of make estimates. If we look at a subscriber universe inclusive of the growth of the digital MVPDs, we think the market is down around close to 3%.","Joe Dorrego","At this point, we're out of time. Thank everybody for joining. Please call if you have any further questions; please give Dan Carey or me a call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

Nallen","Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in today's earnings release, our financial results continue to reflect strong top line revenue growth. We reported first quarter fiscal 2014 revenues for the total company of $7.06 billion, which is up 18% compared to the first quarter a year ago. This growth reflects both the inclusion of revenues from newly consolidated businesses, such as Sky Deutschland and our new international cable sports channels, as well as overall organic revenue growth, which was up in the high-single digits.","Total segment EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.62 billion, a 2% increase over the $1.59 billion reported in the first quarter a year ago. This increase was led by our DBS and Television segments, partially offset by a challenging film comparison and by slightly lower cable network contributions, which reflected the anticipated investment in launching our new cable channels. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced our total reported EBITDA by 2%.","You will also note that our depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter of $313 million is up $139 million from the first quarter a year ago. This increase is almost entirely due to the consolidation of Sky Deutschland and the related acquisition amortization expense of approximately $100 million. Nearly 2\/3 of this Sky D amortization expense results from a onetime cumulative impact as we move toward finalizing the purchase price allocation by the third quarter. Going forward, we expect Sky D related amortization to run at approximately $30 million per quarter.","From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $768 million as compared to $2.25 billion reported the first quarter a year ago. Last year's quarterly results included $1.37 billion of income in other net, principally related to the gain on the sale of our ownership stake in NDS. Excluding the net income effects in both years of amounts reflected in other net, in impairment charges and the gains from participating in BSkyB's share repurchase program, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.33 this year versus $0.38 in the prior year.","Now let me provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the Cable Networks. Overall, total segment revenues increased 12% from last year, highlighted by a 17% increase in affiliate revenues and 11% advertising growth. The 17% affiliate revenue growth was led by higher rates across our channels. Domestic affiliate fees increased 10%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News.","Our reported international affiliate fees were up 40%. Within this overall increase, affiliate fees at the non-sports channels, at FIC and at STAR, grew 19% in local currency terms. The balance of the affiliate fee increase was from the international sports channels, led by this year's inclusion of ESS, Star Sports, EMM and Fox Sports Italy, which was partially offset by the unfavorable foreign exchange impact.","First quarter advertising revenue growth was led by a 21% increase at the international channels, which reflected an approximate 20% local currency increase at the FIC and STAR non-sports channels. The increase in ad revenues related to the international sports channels was fully offset by the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements. Domestic advertising increased 6%, reflecting double-digit gains at FX and the RSNs, partially offset by political advertising declines at FOX News.","As anticipated, this quarter's EBITDA results at the cable segment reflected the commencement of the investments we are making in our new channel launches, as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign currency comparisons. As a result, total segment EBITDA in the quarter of $991 million declined 2% from year-ago levels. We had continued strong EBITDA growth from the RSNs, FOX News, FOX Business, National Geographic and our international channels. This growth was more than offset by the impact of the investments in the new domestic channel launches, a 3% negative impact from foreign currency movement and the absence of prior year distributor credits. Combined, all of these factors impacted year-on-year comparisons by a bit over $100 million, with the new domestic channel launches alone representing around a $50 million impact. In addition, we had increased programming and marketing costs at FX related to the launch of new series.","At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $231 million increased 30% over the first quarter largely due to a doubling of retransmission revenues. Total segment ad revenues were similar to a year ago as the benefit from higher sports ratings and ad pricing was offset by lower general entertainment ratings and reduced political revenues at the stations.","At our Film segment, first quarter EBITDA was $328 million, down 24% from a year ago. While we are pleased with the hit releases impacting the quarter, including The Wolverine and The Heat, we did not have a comparable film to last year's extraordinarily successful release of Ice Age: Continental Drift. Revenues and EBITDA contributions at our Television production units were up year-over-year, primarily due to Modern Family entering domestic syndication and the sale of the first 2 seasons of New Girl to Netflix.","Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $190 million in the quarter as compared to $95 million in the prior year quarter. This increase reflects a nearly $60 million improvement at SKY Italia, driven by the absence of costs associated with last year's London Olympics broadcast. It also reflects the impact from the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's positive EBITDA results.","Total revenues at the segment increased by $562 million, principally reflecting the inclusion of $520 million in Sky Deutschland's revenues. Sky D reported ARPU gains of 6% and a year-over-year direct subscriber increase of 317,000. At SKY Italia, local currency revenues in the quarter were similar to a year ago as the 2% ARPU increase was offset by lower average subs for the period. Quarter-end subscribers of 4.76 million were unchanged from the end of June","Now before I turn to guidance, let me make just a couple of comments related to our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash and $17.5 billion in gross debt. This debt position reflects the issuance of $1 billion of new long-term debt during the quarter, recognizing that we have approximately $900 million of scheduled debt maturities in calendar 2014. Related to the stock buyback, since the date of the separation, we have been consistently repurchasing FOXA shares, resulting in approximately $1.3 billion of repurchases from July 1 through today. We are on pace to complete the $4 billion buyback within the 12-month time frame we previously announced.","And let me finally address our guidance update for fiscal 2014. Chase will provide more commentary a moment -- in a moment around our businesses. And while we have 1 quarter under our belt, it's still quite early in our fiscal year. However, based on all of the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we continue to expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2014 will be in the high-single to low-double-digit range, above the $6.2 billion total segment EBITDA base level of fiscal 2013.","And now let me turn the call over to Chase.","Chase Carey","Thanks, John. There's only been a few months since we outlined our objectives and strategies for our business at our Investor Day in August, yet we're more excited than ever about our future. We're on plan in building the foundation for sustainable long-term growth and are on course overall to meet our financial targets for this year.","The highlight of our last quarter was the successful launch of our 2 new U.S. networks, Fox Sports 1 and FXX. Our short-term priority was establishing the distribution base from which we can grow ratings and subscriber revenue, and we exceeded our targets in launching FS 1 and FXX to 90 million and 72 million homes, respectively. Our initial ratings have been mixed, with success in certain places, particularly with established events and programs. These new channels generated ratings that are a multiple of their predecessors. However, programming schedules are clearly a work in progress. We knew going in that building these networks would take a few years, not months, and many of our signature events and programs are yet to be launched.","At our more established U.S. cable networks, results were in line with our plans. We had strong results in areas like our Regional Sports Networks, where other -- while others, like FOX News, although it's dominate as ever, competitively, faced expected year-on-year headwind comparisons due to 2012 political spending. It was actually a relatively quiet quarter for our established networks as we prioritized the new channel launches.","The last month has been busier with an array of initiatives. FOX News launched a new primetime lineup, live new structure and hosts on our morning show, with great early results. For example, primetime ratings in the first 2 weeks of the new lineup are up north of 20% in both demos and overall. FX launched new seasons of Sons of Anarchy and American Horror Story to record ratings. National Geographic channel has a number of specials and series launches, such as Killing Kennedy, scheduled for this month.","Internationally, we continue to expand, launching new sports channels in Italy and The Netherlands, bringing the total reach of FOX Sports outside of the U.S. to 75 million homes. Last month, we announced the groundbreaking multiyear rights agreement with the German Bundesliga, one of the world's premier soccer leagues. This agreement is a testament to the strength of our global portfolio of channels and our unique ability to reach every corner of the globe. Overall, our international channels continue to execute well and are on target in spite of some economic headwinds in southern Europe and the adverse consequences of the strong dollar. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the long-term growth potential of our international businesses and believe they are better positioned competitively than ever before.","In our broadcast business, our results have been mixed this fall. On the positive side, we continue to build a dual-revenue stream business through both retransmission and reverse compensation with our affiliates. Sports has been a strength, and we're excited about the start of our new drama, Sleepy Hollow, and believe a few of our new comedies show promise. On the flip side, the ratings of a number of returning franchises have been below our expectations. With our new focus on year-round programming, we're in the early part of the broadcast season, and we look forward to new series like Almost Human, which premieres in 2 weeks, as well as the return of American Idol in January and event series like COSMOS and 24 later in the year.","The advertising market trends continue to be solid, scatter is being sold at double-digit pricing to the upfront for broadcast and scatter pricing for cable networks like FX is even stronger. The local ad market finished the September quarter up mid-single digits, excluding politicals and Olympics, and is also up a bit excluding politicals for the December quarter. Our stations successfully launched Modern Family in syndication in September, and our newest station, Charlotte, is already ahead of our targets.","Our studios continue to look to take advantage of the global demand for content, particularly at our television studio. 20th Century Fox Television and its sibling studios are producing 40 series for 16 networks this season, including series like Modern Family, Homeland, American Horror Story and How I Met Your Mother, which were all Emmy award winners this year. Our film studio has been a bit more up and down to start the year, however, we're excited about holiday releases, like Walking With Dinosaurs and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and releases in the second half of the year, including Rio 2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past.","At our distribution platform businesses, our goals are to grow market share through premium content, technology leadership and superior customer service. In Italy, we're executing our plan to rightsize SKY Italia's cost structure and believe we're stabilizing subscriber base in spite of an Italian economy that continues to struggle. In Germany, Sky Deutschland announced its results this morning, with another solid quarter that maintains the growth of recent quarters as further proof that this business is succeeding in Europe's dominant economy. We're also really pleased about the appointment of Mike Hopkins as the new CEO of Hulu. I can't think of a better executive to lead Hulu's exciting future.","Bottom line, we feel good about the momentum of our business. We have a few soft spots to address, but that is always the reality of our business. We're excited about the future and look forward to taking our business to the targets we outlined in August.","With that, we're happy to take your questions.","Reed Nolte","Operator, can we go to taking questions from the investment community now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The strength in television was a little bit more than I would have expected, and I'm wondering were there any major kind of step-ups in retransmission consent agreements that kicked in or reverse-comp deals for that matter? And can you give us -- maybe without even naming the distributors but in terms of timing for the next year, are there any other major step-ups sort of coming this year that you can see?","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean I definitely don't want to get into agreements name by name. Certainly, in the last 12 months, we certainly have 1 large agreement that would have been material, really, to an array of networks certainly -- I get you're talking to broadcast segments, certainly to retransmission. I think the affiliates are a bit more ongoing. I think we said before, we're pretty well through the retransmission really at this point. We did have one large one that we got done this calendar year. We have a couple more left and almost will come around probably to a second cycle of it starting within the next couple of years.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So are we -- we're not expecting any sort of major step-ups for the remaining -- off of this run rate for the remainder of this fiscal year?","Chase Carey","For this fiscal, we have some deals to do. I mean we're always going to have them, and I think they're probably rarely a year we don't have deals to do. So that group is always busy at Christmas times, they don't plan Christmas holidays.","Operator","And that comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen, Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess going back to the balance sheet. John, you mentioned you have so much cash on hand and now that News Corp. is spun -- the new News Corp. is spun, that money settled. I guess, can you update us, John or Chase, a bit what your priorities are in terms of uses of capital? And what is preventing you from buying in the balance of Sky D, like, why wait?","Chase Carey","Well, again, I think we've said with our priorities, they're a combination of sort of investing in our existing businesses to grow them opportunistically. Certainly, the channels are growing right now, and I think they're an example of that. Returning capital to shareholders and we've committed to the $4 billion that we're going to buy back this year, and as John said, we're on track with that. And I think of being opportunistic. We, I think, have acknowledged this still leaves us with a liquid balance sheet, but it's something we'll continue to address and as we run through this buyback, see where we are as we get sort of later in the fiscal year and determine what makes sense from there. I think this is a business in a world that's moving quickly enough that you want to make these judgments as you go along as opposed to locking yourself into straitjackets that may preclude making smart decisions. I think in terms of Sky D, look, we flat out -- we just -- we're pleased with where we are. Our focus is in growing that business, and we feel great about the business. Again, they just reported today, and I think it was really very much maintaining the momentum they've had in that business. But we're comfortable where we are and we'll do what makes sense as we go forward.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could I just ask a quick follow-up in terms of cost? What is the timing of Fox Sports 2? And will there be a significant impact on cost?","Chase Carey","No, I think the focus has been -- the focus is really Fox Sports 1 and FXX, they're certainly the short-term focuses. I think, FS 2, we want to be as successful as it can, but really the -- I think, that said, the priorities are FS 1 and FXX, and that's shortchanging FS 2, Fox Sports 2. But I think FS 2 is more to give us flexibility as we build out the sports channels at times. It's helpful to have 2 channels to -- where you play events and where you move. And I think we wanted to get the lineup set right. We had a handful of channels that we thought we could do something more with, FUEL, FOX Soccer, Speed. And we wanted to get those channels in place for long-term growth. That being said, I think the focus will be on the bigger channels and FS 2 will follow sort of behind FS 1.","Operator","That comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just wanted to explore quickly a little bit on the revenue side of the domestic cable network, rebranded networks. I know it's a long-term process. You're only a couple of months into it, but one thing that sticks out to me is you got a lot more households at networks like Fox Sports 1 and FXX and yet if you compare that to your affiliate fee growth of 10% year-over-year, which you attribute mostly to pricing at some of the big more established networks, just wondered how you can walk us through the math of how those -- all those new households will eventually contribute to that growth and just how the shape of that grows over time.","Chase Carey","I mean, again, if you go back to the 2 channels, you talked of 2 new channels, essentially FXX and FS 1, what they really were was converting channels that were in place with agreements in place for distribution. And we will -- as we go forward and we have -- we've obviously done it with some, but the majority is still to come. But over the next couple of years, we will -- we have agreements coming up essentially, these agreements come up with, really, all our major distributors, and we will look to reset agreements to reflect the fair value of the channels that we have in place.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just had some boring numbers question. Do you, any chance, have the domestic cable network ad growth x FOX News? And noted that it was down year-over-year on political comps.","Chase Carey","I guess it'd be a touch -- a bit higher. It's below the average, I don't know. I bet probably can't do a weighted average off the top of my head.","John P. Nallen","I'd say just a touch higher, Doug, is where it would be.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Another question along those lines. TV stations, I think you said broadcast overall was flat. I was just curious if you could tell us what TV stations' advertising performance was in the quarter?","John P. Nallen","Well, obviously, it was impacted by politicals year-on-year. It was a very big political year, a year ago versus now. But the base markets were up when you take political and Olympics out, so we would have participated as in the growth of the base markets ad.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I don't suppose you the know what the political ad comp was for the quarter off hand.","Chase Carey","I think, I mean -- I know what -- I think, all in, with politicals, I think they were down, the markets were down like high-single digits. I think, with politicals and Olympics out, they were up. If you take the Olympics on a market basis as well, they were sort of up mid-single digits. So that was the magnitude of the market impact.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then last one for you, this is the first time I've seen you sort of break out international drivers between non-sports and sports. Any chance you can give us a sense of how big the non-sports networks are in total versus the sports network for either revenue or EBITDA so we can sort of gauge those trends separately?","John P. Nallen","It's probably easier to go the other way, which is -- I think this will anniversary some time in the second quarter, which is why we separated it out because this year, we have all these brand-new sports networks. But in total, we probably had somewhere around $130 million of revenue from the sports networks this year as against really those sports networks not existing a year ago.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And any chance you'd give a similar driver on the EBITDA side?","John P. Nallen","I don't think they're that...","Chase Carey","No, they're not that material in the EBITDA because there are a couple that are still in the startup phase, Japan, Italy and a couple that are -- more properly [ph] said, the EBITDA number is positive, but not that significant.","Operator","That comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, I just wanted to confirm on the amortization on Sky D that, that was a couple of pennies this quarter, the sort of catch-up. I think you said it was $100 million versus a $30 million normal. Is that accurate?","John P. Nallen","Ben, when you work through everything, tax effect, minority interest, it's $0.01.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But the $100 million and the $30 million are right, the $100 million in this quarter and $30 million on a run rate going forward?","John P. Nallen","That's correct.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then you gave that really nice schedule of revenue growth by component when you reported 20% affiliate revenue growth for the company. Obviously, that includes some of the new acquired networks or newly consolidated networks. Do you have any sort of clean growth rate for the quarter by any chance?","John P. Nallen","I mean, you mean just... You're talking about affiliates?","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. It's the biggest...","John P. Nallen","Yes, I think that the way to look at it is affiliates -- as I said, affiliates without sports, because sports are brand new, there's no comp, affiliate international is up roughly 20%.","Chase Carey","And it wouldn't be that meaningful to the U.S. because the U.S., by and large, were more converse since the networks that we'll get -- there's some resetting, but again the majority will get reset over the coming couple of years.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. And lastly, just on SKY Italia, Chase, I mean subs flattened. Are we maybe near the bottom here on the sort of top line challenges that, that business has had? Do you think we can start to see ARPU and subscriber growth, I'm almost afraid to say it out loud, but some time over the next 3 to 4 quarters?","Chase Carey","I don't know what the -- I mean, I hope so. I mean, I think we believe that. Like we said, our goal for SKY Italia this year was really to stabilize it. I think that's on track. I think there are a number of things in terms of getting on top of the numbers like churn and the like that we feel good about. I mean, the economy is still really shaky. I don't want to get too far out in front of ourselves on projecting how that turns. We are making headway on the costs. We've got a couple of significant contracts we are winding our way out of that will help us on the cost level going forward. So I think all our plans are on track, and I think we've got some nice traction. In terms of some of the initiatives we put in place, it does feel like we're stabilizing that business. And certainly, as we look at probably over the next year to 2 as opposed to quarter to 2, I mean, again, I think for this year what we were looking to do was really stabilize the business and I think return to growth as we go past this fiscal year. So I guess, I'm probably talking more in years than quarters, I mean, quarters get a little micro to be talking about that business. But I think still our plan would be to say we're stabilizing it this year, putting good things in place that can sort of have it and getting on top of the costs that will enable us both from top line, subscribers, and bottom line, return to growth. The potential we still believe is there, even -- and that is not assuming the economy is going to give us any tailwinds. That's assuming the economy certainly for the next couple of years is going to continue to be pretty challenging. We hope it gets better, but that's what we plan.","Operator","Comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just following up on your commentary on the FOX Network. Can you give us some color on how your general entertainment shows are doing versus your expectation sort of the upfront sales. And I guess any -- are any shortfalls meaningful enough at this point that we should think about them in terms of impacting the advertising revs going forward in the coming quarters?","Chase Carey","No, I mean, first on the latter, I mean, it's really early in the year. As we said, we really have tried to move strategically in how we approach the network, so we've launched a handful of shows. We've got a lot of shows in front of us. It's still early. Even shows like X Factor, it's been disappointing to date, but we'll see where it comes back out of the World Series preemptions. So as I said, I mean, it's been a bit mixed. And we've had some places that we have some upside, like sports, and some of the new shows have done well. And some of the returning shows have been disappointing. But it is a mixed bag, and at this point, we still feel we're on course to hit the targets we've got. But we've got a lot of things, a lot of events in front of us to go forward with.","Operator","Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Robert Fishman","It's Robert on for Michael. Can you talk about the FX Now app? Given that you have a lot of content spread across the web, do you expect to pull back any of your FX shows to make it more exclusive to your own service? And has this app been contemplated in your previous affiliate negotiations? And just lastly, did the launch of FX Now change your thought process on signing any future SVOD deals?","Chase Carey","What I'd say about FX, which really probably is really not unique to FX, it's true about any of our networks. I mean what is clear is you're moving from up -- the world's moving from a place where the linear network experience is just 1 part of the viewer experience, and we want to have a brand on top of that network that enables viewers to watch that programming, again, in the proverbial when they want, where they want and how they want. And I think increasingly, we feel it's tremendously important for us for all our networks to have the ability to deliver that experience to consumers, build business models around it with distributors and ourselves that enable us to deliver on that experience and deal with -- continue to still deal with the SVOD market, which is an important part of our overall business, but create the right lines for where our content resides and how people find it. And I think it's important that we create the appropriate -- that our networks have an appropriate distinction and are able to distinguish themselves by the product they control and what they control and how they present it. So it is certainly an area that's important to us. And we'll be spending more time on it, but it's not unique to FX.","Operator","And that comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Chase, for the past few quarters you've highlighted strength in, I think, both Latin America and Asia Pacific [ph]. Some of the headlines that have come out of those regions, are you seeing any kind of headwinds outside of currency?","Chase Carey","For those regions, no, actually, if anything, Latin America has probably been a little better. I think Asia has been pretty much where we expected it. I mean, the regions I said that we still see headwinds are -- is southern Europe. But they'll always ebb and flow when you get to individual countries. But by and large, I think those places -- those regions, Asia and Latin America, have been -- we've been okay. They ebb and flow a bit, but if anything, again, I'd say Latin America, particularly probably, is more an ebb up in the last few months than down.","Operator","That comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is around understanding the timing and progression of the investment in the new channels. You called out or you highlighted 2\/3 of the expense increase was attributable to the net costs associated with the launches, and I think that, that seems like it's in the neighborhood of $200 million to $225 million in the quarter. I think we've been expecting something in the mid-200s for net investment for the year. So are we right there, in that a significant portion of the full year investment was done in the first quarter on a net basis? And then also, looking into 2015, can you kind of remind us what the net investment looks like there given the shift of baseball in particular?","Chase Carey","I'm not sure we shifted baseball. So I mean, I'm not sure what you mean by the shift in baseball but...","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The baseball costs at Fox Sports 1.","Chase Carey","Yes. I think when we've talked, that was -- I think we had those -- that -- those rights in place, so I think when we -- what we described before baseball is not a shift from what we described before. So that when I talked in August, I know the baseball agreements were in place, so what we've been discussing reflects the agreements we've got in place. I mean, first, we're pretty much on track with what we planned for these networks. Again, what we sort of said was over the next 2 years, and that's really the investment spend and then it becomes positive in '16, fiscal '16. It's, in aggregate, over the 2 years, $400 million to $500 million, $200 million-plus in each year, probably a little bit actually heavier in '15 than '14, but $200 million-plus, and we're pretty much on track. And I think, John gave a number for the new networks in the quarter. This quarter, that was about $50 million.","John P. Nallen","Right. The swing was $50 million.","Chase Carey","Yes. The swing was $50 million. So I mean, again, they didn't -- the FX didn't launch -- FXX didn't launch until September and FOX Sports 1 was late October. But right now, we're essentially on track with what we planned for those. I mean, as John said, there were -- there were a couple of other things that occurred the quarter beyond the launches of the 2 channels that adversely affected the comparison.","John P. Nallen","And I'd add, as you dig into those numbers, the expense increases overall for the segment, so you would have a not insignificant increase relating to all those new sports networks that we just covered, EMM, ESS, Japan, Italy, et cetera.","Chase Carey","Yes. I was talking to domestic. The $200 million-plus was worldwide, but the $50 million we are talking to domestic, the domestic 2 startups.","Operator","Comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the cable networks. So we had $50 million of, call it, $200 million-plus this quarter, is it going to roll in about $50 million a quarter? And secondly, your other line was a minus $122 million, is that basically the corporate overhead? And is that a good run rate for the year?","John P. Nallen","I'll cover the second one, which is it's mainly the corporate overhead, but it also includes the intercompany profit elim, which runs heavier in the first quarter because of product moving among the divisions. So I think if you go back to the Investor Day, we indicated we expected the run rate of the segment for the year to be around $400 million, and that's about where we think it should be for the year. And on the first one, just to clarify, what we said is that our expectation is to incur, during the year, net investment of $200 million in the launches of the channels. The impact of that, the $50 million impact we covered is the year-on-year impact of the domestic channels, having the group of channels Chase referred to before against having FS 1 and FX, and that's the $50 million. So we're right on -- as Chase indicated. We're right on plan against all those numbers as we stand right now.","Chase Carey","Yes. And I don't think we want to get too granular on quarter-to-quarter. I mean, in general, it's sort of proportional [ph], but there will always ebbs and flows based on -- particularly as you get into rights and launches, which is just the nature of the business. As we said even our established channel, FX, launched a couple of big originals in the third quarter and that created a year-on-year variance there so -- or spending variance. So generally, that's the case, and it is also included in the business as a whole, with the effect on the top line as we go through distribution agreements.","Operator","And that comes from Vijay Janes (sic) [Jayant] with International Strategy & Investment Group.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A question on Hulu. Given you guys have -- your partners and yourself put in $750 million in this new leadership. Do you sort of foresee this asset transforming into something else? And sort of the catch-up TV it is and really bringing it to the forefront with respect to valuation of Netflix, how could this asset with the best program within the business really be monetized?","Chase Carey","Yes, I mean, I guess -- I mean, I think, in general, I'm going to probably let the management of Hulu speak to the plans for Hulu. Obviously, we believe in it. We've made a significant investment in it going forward. We think there are real opportunities in this -- in the digital space to both create something that can be a real positive for us for sort of the existing distribution ecosystem, as well as a platform that competes with -- in its own way, with the Netflix and the like of the world in creating an alternative in that digital space. The management has only -- Mike Hopkins has only be in place for a week or 2. But I think he'll -- probably, we'll let him be the one who describes how that strategy rolls out.","Operator","Comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","My question is on the international networks. Is southern Europe still getting worse? Some of your peers said that it was a drag early in the year, but now sort of bottoming out. And then another question I had, some of your peers, again, found a way to fight that slump in Europe by converting channels into free-to-air and accelerating advertising growth. Not that your growth is anemic by any means, but is that a strategy that does not fit your assets you think? Or if you could give us an idea how you think about that, please.","Chase Carey","I guess I'd say -- I mean, certainly, southern Europe, whether it's sort of -- I guess you can say maybe it's -- whether it's bottomed out, it certainly is tracking below where it still was a year ago. So in our international segment, Southern Europe is a drag on a year-on-year comparison. I think it's -- I don't think it's necessarily getting worse, but it's still not where we'd like it to be. I think, for us -- look, we compete aggressively on all fronts. We actually have a free-to-air vehicle in Italy. So we want to be opportunistic. That being said, I think we are generally much more a believer in sort of long-term values created through revenues with dual -- through businesses with dual-revenue streams. And I think that would be the -- continue to be the core of what we focus on. I don't think you ever sort of say -- never say never to anything. And again, if there's a place to do that, that makes sense, we'd look at it. But I think, by and large, we believe the dual-revenue business model is the right one to really build long-term value.","Operator","Comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first is what is your appetite for additional TV station assets, particularly in NFC markets? And the second question is, how do you think about cable consolidation? Would this put downward pressure on affiliate fees over time? Any comments you could make?","Chase Carey","I mean, first, there aren't a lot of NFC markets we're not in, so that's a pretty finite world. I mean, we have a pretty full station group. I think we'll always be opportunistic, but I don't think you can say that it's a strategy when there's only a couple of markets we're not in. So I think if there's something that makes sense, we'll always look at it. But by and large, we're pretty pleased with the station growth. Though, as we did in Charlotte, if there's an opportunity to do something that we think creates value for us, we want to be opportunistic. In terms of consolidation, look, I think you're in a world where you're probably going to have a degree of consolidation. Scale is going to matter. Large players are going to get larger, we are. We're launching new networks to be able to expand our content. I think we're pretty comfortable with our ability to meet our goals and to navigate this space and believe we have enough wind at our back and do believe content still is the place to be in a digital world that is -- as much as there is -- as fast as there's consolidation, there seem to be new buyers. So I think we probably would not be surprised if there is consolidation, but I don't think it changes our expectations or plans or confidence in our ability to execute our plans.","Operator","That question comes from the line with Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a broader question about the studio for Mr. Carey. The studio business seems to go through these sort of multi-decade runs, where people focus on sort of lower-budget films and then they move towards tent-poles and then back towards lower-budget films. Are we seeming to be sort of in the, I don't know, sixth or seventh year of everyone in the industry sort of pursuing in tent-poles. Do we think we're in a new era now and this is just the studio model that will exist? Or do you anticipate there's going to be another shift where people go back...","Chase Carey","I mean, I guess, everybody always tries to sort of look at film business and draw sort of -- draw conclusions about sort of the -- about trends and how films are being made. I mean I think, realistically, you try and make great films, and some of those are less expensive, some of those are more. I think you'd be realistic about the business you're in. So the last 3 to 4 years is that -- 5 years, the home entertainment market shifted. You got to be realistic about how you approach and what you invest in and how you navigate a business that, obviously, is a complicated one to navigate. But I think the minute that you start believing there are formulas for sort of what types of films to make, I think you probably are putting yourself in a corner. So I think you continue to look for great films. Some of those will be the low end, some of them the high end, some of them in the middle. And we've got a couple of big films next year we're very excited about. We've got -- we had a film this year on the other end like The Heat, which was great for us. So I think those sort of conclusions or judgments are really not how you manage the business by filling up -- putting -- trying to fill up slots.","Operator","That comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'll stick with a couple of digital questions, too. The -- I'll switch to the FOX NOW app. And just maybe any early takes on any figures you can provide, maybe like number of downloads and whatnot as you've been promoting catching up on Sleepy Hollow on it and the type of behavior that you're seeing from viewers on it? And then just as a second one, I believe you guys partnered up with Twitter on their new Amplify product to do some promotions around the new fall season and just interested how that early test worked.","Chase Carey","We feel -- I mean, it's difficult to sort of go through them one by one because it's a -- in many ways, we've got a blur of activity. As I said, what is clear, whether it's FOX or FX or Sports or News for that matter, we're clearly moving very quickly into a multidimensional world, a multi-platform world and people accessing that content in different shapes and forms and want to have an ability to create experiences around that content, and we've got to meet that. And actually, we feel good. We -- on the FOX Network, we've had a position of leadership in the sort of social networking space really for a period of time now. We want to build on that. We think things like -- some of the relationships we touched on are exciting additions to that but, by and large, it is important for us to continue to provide abilities for our consumers and in some ways, our distributors, the right business relationships to deliver new and exciting experiences to consumers.","Operator","Comes from the line of James Dix from the Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 2 for you. You mentioned earlier your sale of 2 seasons of New Girl to Netflix. Just wondering, more broadly, how we should be thinking about the SVOD revenue line. Is that kind of a $300 million to $400 million figure, all in, which is growing a little bit this year? Or are there any more step-function changes in that, that we could be looking for? And then just secondly, wanted to know kind of what your view is on reverse compensation going forward as part of that fee line going into the TV stations? Do you think there's some misallocation or disconnect between the share of value which is going to affiliates and how much is being contributed by the network programming that's going to be caught up? Or is most of the growth just going to be catching up with the basic retrans that is going on industry-wide?","Chase Carey","What's the first part of the question?","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just the SVOD.","Chase Carey","Oh, the SVOD. Yes, I think the SVOD -- I mean, look, it's a significant -- certainly, it's an important business for us. We're actively engaged in it. I think, this year, we're probably expecting it to be sort of reasonably flat year-on-year. But that being said, that's sort of -- it's one we don't want to get in front of ourselves projecting. There's a lot of discussions going on, on product that's not in those projections. This -- I mean, in many ways, SVOD is part of a larger -- sort of the larger digital space. So I don't think you want to sort of define it too narrowly in terms of the appetite for our product in these digital platforms. It is one we continue to aggressively pursue certainly internationally. It's probably an area -- it is in earlier-growth stages as the number of countries are just -- the number of the players are just moving into. But I think you're going to continue to see players in this, and we're obviously going to be part of it from different directions, as people talk about FOX NOW or FX, On Demand, and all of that becomes part of this digital experience. And how do you monetize it? Both through subscriptions and advertising and sales. And we're going to participate in all fronts. I mean, the pure SVOD revenues, again, for the current year will be -- I think are reasonably flat year-on-year for us. But there are a lot of discussions going on that aren't necessarily reflected in those, and it's an area, in general, which I guess I'd say the digital platforms delivering a richer content experience that we expect to be a real area of growth for us as we go forward the next few years.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And just a second one, just to simplify it, do you think the share that the networks are contributing of the value that is being paid in retrans has been going up over the past couple of years? Is that going to be one of the dynamics of the reverse compensation growth going forward?","Chase Carey","Reverse compensation, you mean from our affiliates to us?","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Exactly, right.","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean, certainly, the reverse compensation is an important part of our overall broadcast business. It's -- we're investing a lot in content that is still the most important content out there, and it's important for us to receive fair value. We greatly value our relationship with our affiliates. It's a partnership that has been good for all of us. But we need to have business models that enable us to generate that dual revenue, whether it's directly through our O&Os and retransmission or reverse comp through affiliate relationships that enable all of us to be successful. We obviously want successful affiliates. We want them to grow and be successful and be able to fulfill that partnership with sort of great local programming, with event national programming. And that's the goal we have. But as part of that, we do need to -- we need the reverse compensation component of it to be important. We think the value of our broadcast signal to everybody who deals with it is probably still undervalued competitively any way you look at it in the marketplace today. The importance of that content and the viewership of it still clearly is not reflected in what we get. But we've tried to approach it in a constructive way that starts to recognize that value and move it in the right direction.","Operator","And that comes from the line of Barton Crockett, SDR (sic) [FBR] Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was curious about your cash spend on share repurchase which is settled into this nice healthy pace of $4 billion or so a year? Clearly, you can afford to do more. What would it take to get you guys to step that up? And why don't you do more to kind of move closer to the leverage targets that you could support there at the company?","Chase Carey","We -- we're not going to get into hypotheticals. We think this is a meaningful return of capital at this point in time, and it is what we felt was appropriate for this year as we move towards -- so as we move towards the end of the year, we'll see what makes sense for us going forward. I don't know if it answers it or not.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. If you have any further questions, please call me or Joe Dorrego here in New York.

Welcome to the Twenty-First Century Fox First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, Operator. Hello everyone and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and year and we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The Company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2016, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition and the reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thanks Reed, good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to have delivered a strong quarter from both top and bottom line earnings. The progress we\u2019ve made against our earnings objectives is broad based representing improvements across business segments and geographies. It reflects operational momentum across our businesses, driven by our focus on creative excellence and by our efforts to enhance the consumer experience plus better monetizing our content.","A number of key factors contributed to 17% year-on-year EBITDA growth from 7% increase in revenue. Our film segment more than doubled its quarterly earnings contribution, thanks to key film releases as well as the sale of some SVOD television rights. Summer releases, Independence Day Resurgence and X-Men, Apocalypse were key contributors. Our recently released Tim Burton\u2019s film Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children had a strong opening, which will primarily benefit the current December quarter.","Under the leadership of Stacey Snider the film studio has bolstered its team by attracting key senior executive talent spanning marketing, international distribution, business affairs and licensing and together they\u2019re well focused on Starring the studio\u2019s future course. In the short-term there\u2019s a lot to do. Our forward slate is strong Why Him, Assassins Creed, Jackie, Hidden Figures and Logan, all released in the balance of this fiscal year. It\u2019s a diverse and high quality slate that we have solid expectations up.","Our cable networks earnings improvement was driven 10% revenue growth on solid gains in both affiliates and advertising revenues, both domestically and internationally. Of course FOX News has never been stronger amidst an intense election season. It just marked 59th consecutive quarter as the number one in cable news and just finished October as the number network in both prime time and all day across all of cable. Last month also marked the first time a FOX News anchor moderated a general election presidential debate. We have to give a shout out to Chris Wallace\u2019s superb debate performance, which notably receive kudos on both sides of the aisle.","Overall in the cable world and of particular note, we added overall domestic pay TV subscribers this past quarter. We\u2019re particularly excited by all the new DMVPD services that are emerging in the market place. Hulu is executing against its development plan and is on track to launch its new DMVPD service early next year as we have discussed previously. Our major brands are included in every DMVPD service that has emerged, with affiliate fees that are absolutely on par with the first sub affiliate fees we get from traditional pay TV distributors.","Importantly the strategic focus we put on our brands across our leadership in entertainment, news and sports positions us well for the transition to IP delivered. We\u2019ve our product focus that is as intense as it is unique and we\u2019re seeing the benefits of all our efforts and investments in that area. Fundamentally, break out content is what drives up the value of our brands. This is at the center of our growth strategy. A review of the business highlights underscores our momentum in this regard.","And I\u2019ll turn it over now to John and James to provide more details.","John Nallen","Thank you, Lachlan and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased with the strong financial results we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share.","First quarter revenues increased 7% to $6.5 billion, led by double digit revenue growth at the cable network segment and solid increases at the film segment. Total segment EBITDA was $1.79 billion, a 17% increase from the prior year, reflecting strong growth from the film and cable segments.","This quarter\u2019s results include an approximate $40 million negative impact from foreign currency rates and absent this impact our overall EBITDA growth rate will be nearly 20%. From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $827 million or $0.44 per share.","Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and of equity earnings adjustments from Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, adjusted EPS was $0.51 this quarter, which is 34% increase over the comparable $0.38 reported a year ago.","Now, while our tax rate in the quarter was below 30%, we expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be closer to the low to mid 30% range. With that I\u2019ll provide some added comments on the performance at our operating segments, Starting with the cable networks, with total segments EBITDA of $1.38 billion was up 6% on 10% revenue growth.","Overall cable segment expenses increased 12% but excluding the impact of the consolidation of Nat Geo partners, they were up 8%. Domestic cable network revenues increased 10%, with affiliate fee growth of 8% and 6% advertising increases. The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands as well as subscriber additions at some of our still expanding networks.","First quarter advertising revenue growth was driven by the rating strength at FOX News and also reflects a 2 percentage point benefit from the consolidation of the Nat Geo businesses we acquired last November.","EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 9% over the prior year, reflecting a revenue growth partially offset by higher baseball cost at the RSNs, higher entertainment programming cost at the FX channels and the inclusion of the expenses related to the acquired National Geographic businesses.","First quarter reported international cable revenues grew 9%, driven by 8% increase in reported affiliate revenues, which were up 16% on a local currency basis. Reported advertising revenues increased 6% over the prior year on local currency growth of 11% led by Star in India.","International channel EBITDA contributions on a reported basis decreased 7%, but excluding the effects of foreign exchange primarily from Latin America, would have increased by 6%. As expected international channel expenses increased, largely reflecting higher sports cost from our broadcast of the Summer Olympics in both India and Latin America during the quarter.","At our television segment, EBITDA was $191 million versus the 196 million reported in the prior year. This slight year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower advertising revenues, largely from the absence of the prior broadcast of both Emmy\u2019s and the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup Final as well as the market shift of advertising dollars toward the Summer Olympics. The advertising revenue declines were largely offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth and higher content revenues led by Hulu.","At the film segment, EBITDA of $311 million was more than double the amount we reported in the prior year. The current quarter was also driven by the SVOD licensing of Homeland, lower theatrical releasing cost as well as higher profits from this year\u2019s summer film releases including Independence Day Resurgence, as compared to last year\u2019s slate which included the release of Fantastic Four.","Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter we repurchased approximately $410 million in Fox A shares, reducing total shares outstanding compared to a year ago by 10%. We now have approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our overall repurchase authorizations.","And with that let me turn it over to James.","James Murdoch","Thanks very much, John. Good afternoon everyone. So as you\u2019ve heard the fiscal year has Started well. So I just like to spend a minute on some highlights and then some things to focus on going forward.","First, I want to reiterate that our strategy, a focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on screen that clearly differentiates in our detention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available not less is paying dividends.","Furthermore, the changes we\u2019ve made to the organization are delivering a leaner and more capable company and the team continues to move at a very fast pace. Creatively the business is in good health. FX has set a new industry record for basic cable wins at the Emmy this year and our original series American Horror Story launched as the highest rated cable TV series and a new series Atlanta ranks number two in comedies behind only South Park.","National Geographic\u2019s new programming strategy is just now kicking in with the November 14 premiere of its first global event series Mars, which begins its new premium programming push. And on the broadcast television side, we got real traction of the Start of the new season with a number of new series, including Lethal Weapon, Pitch, The Exorcist and Son of Zorn.","Currently network entertainment advertising is pacing ahead of last year after a summer that saw a lot of demand absorbed by the Olympics broadcast on NBC. At the television studio, we\u2019re excited that we have three of the top four scripted series on broadcast television today, with Empire, This is Us and Modern Family.","Fox Sports 1 recently marked its third anniversary and its highest viewership ever. In fact the last two weeks marked its most watched in the highest rate weeks in the networks history beating ESPN around the clock for the first time ever. In addition to the strength in live events, FS1 focused on building its pre and post-game programming is paying dividends. And the studio shows from, Skip and Shannon to the Herd and Garbage Time and Fox Sports live are surging and hitting ratings highs.","As for broadcast sports, the World Series has delivered the largest live baseball audience in over a decade, generating huge amount of interest from advertisers and pricing accordingly. We\u2019re also pleased with how well Fox is doing with its NFL programming. While there\u2019s a lot of noise about declining NFL ratings, Fox\u2019s game day viewership on Sunday is holding up well and is within 4 percentage points of last year.","Meanwhile our NFL game continues to be televisions highest rated and most watched show in any day part averaging over 25 million viewers. And from an advertising perspective, we continue a strong pace over where we were last year at this time with the year-to-year NFL ad pricing increases in the high single digits. Our regional sports networks continue to excel. We had a great baseball season with five of our RSNs ranking number one in their markets among all broadcasting cable on game nights.","Star India\u2019s advertising revenues returned to double digit year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis and we continue to see exceptional growth of our mobile video platform Hotstar. Between June and October, average watch time doubled on the platform and minutes viewed is currently more than double, all the mainstream competitors combined and more than 10X the watch time of Netflix, which launched in India earlier this year.","Our Fox and National Geographic brands are also showing strong growth in almost every region, on global Ex U.S. basis revenue growth in the teens on a constant currency basis. The Sky business our largest affiliate is also making great strides as the strength in breadth of the platform continues to drive accelerated growth, both in subscribers, but also in the tremendous content business that comprises so much of the company\u2019s portfolio.","In closing, it\u2019s an exciting time for us. As we look across the business, we forget about where we are. We\u2019ll turn it over to questions now and we\u2019re happy to be as helpful as we can be. Reed?","Reed Nolte","Thank you, James. And now operator, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks, I have one for the three of you and one quickly for John following up. For the three, Lachlan you definitely called out that there was acceleration subs this quarter which is a break from the trend we\u2019ve seen. Can you spend some more time talking about which networks drove to be, was there also an improvement in kind of matured networks and how sustainable is this trend?","Lachlan Murdoch","Great, thanks Michael. So I think there\u2019s two important points to call out here and that is the - as I mentioned sort of net growth in subs. A lot of this is actually with FX, FXM and FS2 sort of spinning down into broader bundles, right. So adding subscribers have been part of their broader bundles and I should add also this happened with our Fox business channel as well. In addition to that obviously the emerging growth of some of the over the top platforms and our distribution on all of the new DMVPDs helped us grow subs in the quarter.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, let me ask John, you made a point in the last call saying, you expect a 32 [ph] growth feedback in weightage in this fiscal year, but already in this quarter you\u2019ve accelerated from where you were just a quarter before. So can you update us on, is there more to come or was this more [indiscernible] is here?","John Nallen","No, I think still the back end weighted point stands just because of renewals that we have coming in the back half of the year. And look it is nice to get subscriber additions during the quarter, some expected some - less expected given the comments Lachlan just made about the emerging DMVPDs and it\u2019s great to see the traction that they\u2019re getting there.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks very much. I think for James and Lachlan, I just love if you could talk about your latest view on the need for scale and media and your appetite for M&A, given the backdrop of an AT&T Time Warner merger announcement. And then for John, this might be also reminded, but this as we think about the December quarter, the World Series going seven games, if you could give us any sense of how that might impact numbers. I appreciate it.","James Murdoch","It\u2019s James. Hi, Doug thanks. So in terms of scale, look I think as we\u2019ve often said, this is an industry and a business that thrives on scale. But at the same time, scale for scale sake is you know are not something that we think should be pursued, we really like the business mix that we have. We\u2019ve really simplified the operating model over the last number of years and invested in these big scale brands that really operate at the top of their games, I think all over the world. And we feel pretty good about that and our focus remains, execution and operating the business as best as we can and growing it as fast as we can. I think - so there is no heightened appetite for any inorganic activities proposed - recent activity and I would say as I said I think the last quarter, we really try to be very, very disciplined about this, we are very high heard all in terms of how we think about investment and how we think about doing things. We slowly passed on lot of opportunities that we thought were - the price was just not going to deliver the value for shareholders that we think that we want to deliver. So I don\u2019t think there is really any change there with respect to our own posture. I would say though that our business is growing really well and there\u2019s investment in these brands, there\u2019s investment in the content and programming, there\u2019s investment in the capabilities around the business from a user experience perspective and a monetization perspective are really getting traction. So we feel good about the business mix and as I said we are operating and are involved in it.","John Nallen","And just your question Doug on World Series, look we have all been around this and after you\u2019ve been through four game sweeps and disappointment you get there, but to get seven game in a World Series with the nation really focused on tonight's game is - it\u2019s a good benefit for us. So we are not getting into numbers, it\u2019s positive segment.","Lachlan Murdoch","We just made a lot of pitching change, but the ads are getaway ads.","John Nallen","Right, and there will be.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you, John. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you, we will go to line of Rich Greenfield representing BTI. Please go ahead.","Rich Greenfield","Hi, thanks for taking the question. First of all just AT&T, I think Randall, when he was on stage at the Wall Street Journal conference, him and Jeff announced that FOX was part of the Direct TV now bundle. A, is that accurate or did they jump the gun and is the $35 tier without RSNs something you are okay with or is it a non-Starter given that I think you have entry level bundling on sling - one of the sling package and I think Hulu, the RSNs are in the entry level package, so just wondering how you think about that and I have strategic follow up.","James Murdoch","Rich, thanks, look all our phase we certainly anticipate to be part of major brand to be part of - all of these emerging DMVPDs are all the major ones anyway and beyond that I don\u2019t want to go into any particular commercial relationship until they are - sort of it is more out there. But we certainly anticipate the inclusion of his brands and that\u2019s why we have been investing these brands and it is why we really adopted the strategy we have around these brands that matter for customers and I think seeing that early growth now and these new DMVPD entrances that we see in this quarter. We really think an exciting moment of growth over the next number of years as this downstream competition really increases with lower barriers to entry for these players and at a price point I think that do make a difference for customers.","To your second question around those price points and the inclusion of different brands all of our MVPD contracts have certain provisions for penetration rate, for packaging et cetera, so there is an amount of flexibility that our partners have, but we certainly expect all of our brands to be available to the customers of those DMVPDs, but the packaging, much of the packaging is really to come. You leave the packaging up to the DMVPD themselves and the pricing, how they choose the price and differentiate themselves with their customers, I mean the key thing for us is that we are monetizing our content in exactly the same way as we all with the traditional MVPDs so we are not out of pocket regardless of how they pay package or choose package.","Rich Greenfield","And then just strategically Bob Iger made a comment recently that despite all of their great content and even with their ownership of Hulu, which he actually didn\u2019t talk to, that he may need more of a direct access to the consumer, we\u2019re just wondering how do you all think about that issue of - obviously you have Sky in the UK, or the Sky platforms across Europe, but how do you think about that issue as you think about U.S., is Hulu an offer, do you need more direct access in the U.S.?","James Murdoch","I think certainly the user experience is kind of dimension of competition that is really important and we look you mentioned sky across Europe and you know what the business there has been able to do with creating user experience that is really seconds and I think globally but also our affiliate Hulu being able to do that here, which said in multiplatform viewing if I look at our entertainment network for example on Hulu and our owned operated apps on an authenticated basis is almost 20% of our prime time viewing now. And we think that is really encouraging Start, so it is not just to say that direct to consumer or user experience means you have to be an independently priced sort of offering out there, it is also something through the authentication process and through new partners like the DMVPDs we can do quite a lot.","One of the most exciting things is, ad innovation, so having that closer relationship with customers or working with partners like the DMVPDs and Hulu going forward, where we can innovate in terms of advertising, we can reduce loads, we have much more capability there, we think the real positive for the business. So I don\u2019t think it is - I don\u2019t think you have to necessarily say that an independently priced a la carte or otherwise kind of direct to consumer offering is necessary, but where it is appropriate and where we think we can do some really interesting we will for example in India with HotStar which is growing gang busters and we really saw an opportunity in mobile video to do something around the content that we create there and that\u2019s been a great success and we think it is going to be a huge platform going forward. So I think it is the mix depending up to the region but there is no question that user experience is really important in terms of how people discover our programming, how they interact with them and how we can monetize in the best way possible. Thank you Rich","Rich Greenfield","Thank you so much.","James Murdoch","Thank you, Rich. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you we will go to Jessica Reif Cohen with BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you I would actually like to follow up on that topics on what steps are you taking specifically to kind of drive the targeted average I think across all platform, so I mean obviously AT&T, talks a lot, albeit that on their platform but that\u2019s a link one and you just mentioned two little so what you are going do to really drive adjustable [ph] advertising across all platforms and I guess also on the advertising side can you just comment on current what market conditions what you are seeing and to just in fiscal Q2?","James Murdoch","Sure, with respect to add innovation across the piece, certainly we work with number of partners, our distributers and downs in distributors and to be very candid with you now we would like to work more closely with them. Some of that has been challenging in terms of actually getting targeted advertising, dynamic ad insertion all of those things access to data can be challenging, we monetize streams for example on our owned and operated apps where we have some ability to target and we can actually put new ad product in place at a much, much higher rates and we do on cable DOD services. And that\u2019s something that I think MVPDs have to address and that\u2019s I think we have put a better user experience together there. So I think those things will level up as competition increases, but also across the board from Hulu to O&O app [ph]to some of our third party distributors as well as the these the DMVPDS emerging, the opportunity for ad innovation is much, much greater than in the legacy infrastructure that is there. So we think that\u2019s really exciting.","Lachlan Murdoch","And then just in terms of future advertising pacing and scatter pricing obviously through this quarter we are now looking past the Olympics effect and the comparison with the Emmys revenue last year as John mentioned in the FIFA Women's World Cup revenue, this thing more normalized sort of pattern having said that we are at this point with the level of political spending that obviously we have seen or we would have expected but having said that pacing is up in the low to mid-single digit and scatter pricing is conservative up between 20% and 30% and with significant enough inventory that is making an impact.","Jessica Reif Cohen","And then just one last thing on this you mentioned the asset mix that you have is and focus on strong brands but with the weakness in the Pound, are you rethinking potentially buying the balance of Sky?","James Murdoch","Look I think you know as every quarter we talk about this with you guys and I would just say that Sky business is great business, it is growing really well, the integration of three Sky's has been successful and we are very focused on that business growing and executing as well as it can.","Lachlan Murdoch","Thank you Jessica, could we have next question please.","Operator","Thank you we will go to Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger","Hi, thanks. I wanted to take your temperature on couple of major sport fields that are coming up and then a quick one for John which seems to be norm here. One of it, explore the Indian Premier League in India I believe that is currently Sony controls, I think that comes up at the end of next year, looks like people are saying according to press Amazon might be interested, I am sure you guys are interested, but love to know how that factors into your thinking about the targets for Star India EBITDA growth and how aggressive you need to be or not be for that guy. And then similarly in the States on the MMA contracts right, should be coming up as a cornerstone for Fox Sports 1 how you think about it what you do with or without that and how aggressive you need to be there. And the quick one for John I guess would be just be can you help us in a situation where you are in a dispute with a big traditional distributor about - actually way to get dispute about the rate card for your networks, how are you accruing that affiliate fee revenue are you accruing it at the rate that you believe you should be paid or at the rate that your counter party believes you should be paid? Thanks.","James Murdoch","Todd, it is James here. So first of all to say on the IPL, I think it is well known that there\u2019s a - it\u2019s well known that it\u2019s very unclear when those rights will come to market. There has been a delay in that process. But I would say, look with respect to the Indian business we obviously look at different rights packages as they come up, we have really grown the breadth of that business in terms of sports with BCCI domestic cricket contract as well as the growth in Kabbadi and the Indian Super League, so it is really a broad business there and new rights come up where we always will have a look at. There is nothing at this point I can see in the outcome of those things that would deter it from the medium term target that we have laid out for profit growth at Star which were pacing towards pretty well, so we feel confident about that. And then with respect to UFC and also with any rights packages as well, you make choices about these things and it is really fundamentally about value. I think at Fox Sports 1we really try to broaden the overall rights package as well, the right offering to the customers and the live event offering to customers and we would look at any renewal or new rights packages coming on to Fox Sports 1, from perspective of value and the perspective of what we think is really can continue to bring to customers. But the UFC has been a great partner for us and we got little ways to run on that and that\u2019s really not until fiscal \u201819, the impact would be and we will take it as it come. Just on the other question we booked the fees on the contract rates and we had a contract with charter and we are booking the fees at that level.","John Nallen","Thank you Todd, operator at this time we briefly have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you, our final question then will come from the line of Ben Swinburne representing Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you, just wanted to focus on domestic cable network, it\u2019s obviously a highlight this quarter. Anything besides the subscriber improvement that drove the acceleration in revenue growth, I think you went from kind of the mid six last quarter to 8%. And John, I just want to confirm that you were saying that this to accelerate again in the second half of fiscal year as you go through some more renewals. And then just wanted to come back to FOX News, may be for James, lot of changes in management there including I believe head of affiliate sales which has been a big diver of growth for the company over time what are your thoughts on strategies for driving rates on FOX News going forward, you still bullish that there\u2019s upside there and any change in strategy from the management change on that probably will be helpful thanks.","John Nallen","First on the first part of the first question, in this quarter there have been no renewals at a higher pricing, so the drive in affiliate revenue is really from volume [indiscernible] pricing.","as you look at it Ben sequentially which is six to eight that\u2019s all volume, pricing, brands and the same Q4 as it is in Q1, but what we do have, we have significant deals coming up in the near future. James you want to talk to that?","James Murdoch","Yeah and then on the FOX News side, its - look I think there is absolutely growth there in affiliate fees. The channel is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and just completed another quarter of leadership in record viewing. Obviously, we expect the ratings and stuff like that sort of come off after the election that usually happens and then comes back. So we feel that the product has enormous amount of value to customers and that\u2019s have been reflected in its ability to and our ability to continually grow those affiliate fees. And we do have some renewable in the near term on FOX News that are pretty old contracts, so leveling up to the market and merely leveling up to the market creates growth opportunities there, so there is no real change in strategy there and from time to time certainly there are leadership changes and other things like that I mean affiliate side as well, but nothing that would change their basic trajectory in course that we\u2019re on.","Ben Swinburne","Great, thank you.","James Murdoch","At this time we would like to conclude the call and thank you everybody for joining us today.","John Nallen","Thank you very much every one and enjoy the ball game.","Reed Nolte","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay starting at 6:30 this evening and running through November 16 at midnight.
