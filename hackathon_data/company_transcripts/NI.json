[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Randy Hulen, VP of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.","Randy G. Hulen","Thank you, and good morning. On behalf of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Partners, I would like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Chief Financial Officer; and Jo Hamrock, currently Executive Vice President and Group CEO. Soon to be, Joe will be taking on the role of the NiSource CEO after our plant separation. As you know, the primary focus of today's call is to review NiSource's financial performance for the first quarter of 2015 as well as provide an overall business update. Following the NiSource prepared remarks, we also will share a brief overview of the first quarter results for Columbia Pipeline Partners, which were also released this morning. We will then open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we will refer to the supplemental slides available on our website.","And finally, I would like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. With all those items out of the way, I'd like to now turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We have a crisp agenda today. I'll touch on several key strategic takeaways. Steve will review our financial results, and then Joe and I will share key execution highlights for NiSource's utilities and CPG.","If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few key takeaways for the quarter as well as an update of the separation of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Group.","For the quarter, results were solidly in line with our plan. The NiSource team delivered $0.85 per share non-GAAP in the first quarter versus $0.82 per share in 2014. Our teams also continued to execute on core infrastructure investment plans at all of our businesses, and capital expenditures across our utility and pipeline segments remain on track. As a reminder, for 2015, we expect a record spend of $2.4 billion. We also remain on track to complete the separation of NiSource and CPG, which we anticipate will happen on July 1, 2015. At the time of the separation, shareholders are expected to receive 1 share of Columbia Pipeline Group common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. As you know, the transaction is expected to be tax free for shareholders and the company. In preparation for the separation, experienced leadership teams have been named for both companies, and just recently, the respective NiSource and CPG executive teams discussed their go-forward financial plans with the 3 major credit-rating agencies.","As we said when we announced the separation, we expect both companies will be investment grade. Current expectations are that CPG will be formally rated prior to its May debt recapitalization transaction. And the NiSource's credit ratings will be addressed at or about the time of separation. With each step in the separation process, including the debt recapitalization process, we're positioning NiSource and CPG to be ranked among the leaders in their respective business segments. We expect both will be well capitalized and have robust and transparent, long-term growth plans, growing dividends and solid leadership and the capacity and focus to deliver enhanced, long-term growth.","To profile the business strategies and growth plans of the respective companies, we've scheduled 2 separate webcasts on Thursday, May 14. First, Joe Hamrock and team will provide an overview of NiSource's pure play utility business, including its investment opportunities and its commitment to customers and the communities it serves.","Following the NiSource call, CPG's executive team will host a similar call. The team will highlight CPG's solid core business, its strategically located assets and its portfolio of transformational modernization and growth opportunities. The NiSource webcast will start at 9 a.m. and the CPG webcast will begin at 10:30 a.m., both Eastern Time. The event with the company presentations will be available at www.nisource.com. In addition to the May 14 webcast, we'll maintain regular communication regarding the separation process through our normal channels, including press releases and filings with the SEC.","Now I'll turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our first quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides.","Stephen P. Smith","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $268 million or $0.85 per share, which compares to about $258 million or $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $20 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $268 million for the first quarter versus about $266 million for the same period in 2014. At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business segments delivered financial results in line with our expectations during the first quarter. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $163 million compared to about $159 million in 2014. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $22 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed into service and new firm capacity contracts. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $67 million in operating earnings compared to about $74 million in the same period in 2014.","Net revenues, again excluding trackers, were relatively flat, due primarily to lower off-system sales.","And finally, our Gas Distribution business came in at about $306 million compared to about $280 million in 2014. Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $43 million. As the numbers attest, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.","Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $2 billion of net available capacity as of March 31. Of our $2.4 billion capital investment program planned for 2015 at NiSource and CPG, approximately 80% of these investments are focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization remains solid at about 54% as of March 31. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource, CPG separation, including establishing a strong financial foundation with expected investment-grade credit ratings. A CPG long-term debt offering of $2.75 billion and the NiSource tender transaction will begin soon. As we've noted previously, the proceeds of CPG's debt offering will be used to fund a one-time cash distribution to NiSource prior to the separation.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob and Joe to discuss a few execution highlights from our business segments.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with highlights for CPG on Slide 6, and then Joe will cover highlights for NIPSCO and our gas utilities. The CPG team continues to advance the steady stream of transformational growth projects, which are in addition to its landmark modernization program. The latest news on that front includes the completion of an open season for 2 major regulated transmission projects and the development of a new midstream project. We're happy to report that we have a critical mass of firm customer commitments in place following the binding open season for the Mountaineer and Gulf XPress projects which concluded on April 23. As a reminder, these 2 projects would involve an investment of approximately $2.6 billion and would add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission and nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. And on the midstream front, our team commenced discussions with a major producer on another dry gas gathering trunk line in southwestern Pennsylvania. Once we have all the details confirmed, we'll provide an update on this exciting new project. All of CPG's other in-progress modernization, growth and midstream projects remain on track. You'll recall that CPG's targeted capital investment level for 2015 is approximately $1.1 billion. A full highlight of our in-flight growth projects can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the supplemental deck.","With that, let me welcome Joe Hamrock to the call. Joe?","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Let's shift first to NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7. The NIPSCO team is continuing to deliver on our customer-focused strategy of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. The FGD unit under construction at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generating Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit and with those we placed in service over the past 2 years, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed. NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction began on a 345-kv Reynolds-Topeka line. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.","We remain on track and committed to our Indiana electric and gas modernization programs. As set forth in our TEDUS [ph] plan, we have about $190 million in planned spend this year. These investments help ensure continued safe, reliable and affordable service to customers. And as you likely saw earlier this month, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued a ruling regarding some of the elements of the approved electric modernization plan. The court upheld key components of the commission's order, and one item related to the level of investment detail within the order will need to be revisited as part of the regulatory and legal process.","As the first utility to file a plan under the TEDUS [ph] Statute, we recognized the potential for temporary delay. We're evaluating the rule and remain committed to our modernization investments, which are essential to our ongoing plan for upgrading our system to serve [indiscernible] now and into the future. NIPSCO's agenda remains focused on customer service and high-value targeted programs that enhance the reliability and environmental performance of its systems. Investments in our electric infrastructure are expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015.","Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary, regulatory and customer programs. Touching on a few regulatory highlights in recent months. In March, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC to support continuation of our well-established infrastructure modernization and safety programs. If approved as filed, the case would increase annual revenues by approximately $46 million. We expect a decision in that case later this year. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed a rate case on April 16 with the Massachusetts Department of Public utilities, seeking an annual revenue increase of approximately $49 million. The filing reflects the company's commitment to maintain natural gas safety, customer service and reliability. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2016 in that case. Also in Massachusetts, later today, we expect the decision from the DPU for our 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Cost recovery associated with the 2015 investments outlined in the plan would begin tomorrow and increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million.","And Columbia Gas Virginia settled rate case remains pending before the commission. A final order on the $25 million revenue increase is expected later this year. In more recent news, just last week, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacements and demand side management rider. The rider provides for recovery of its well-established pipeline replacement program and energy efficiency program investments. So overall, we expect to invest approximately $900 million during 2015 across our company's Gas Distribution businesses. These investments help improve reliability and safety for our customers and communities, provide additional customer access to natural gas service and reduce emissions. Through well-established recovering mechanisms in all 7 states, these investments are expected to generate incremental revenue and sustainable returns for shareholders. So in summary, NiSource gas and electric utilities are in full execution mode on all fronts and very well positioned for the future. Thanks, again, Bob. And I'll hand things back to you.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Joe. As you can see, continued solid performance on a strong, well-established growth strategy. Before briefly discussing the results of Columbia Pipeline Partners and opening the call to your questions, let me reiterate several key points. We remain focused on and are on track with our current business and customer plans. We remain on track with the CPG separation scheduled for July 1. We expect both companies will be well financed and very well positioned to execute on their distinct strategies. And now, a couple of dates and actions related to the separation that I should highlight once again. We expect to receive our CPG credit ratings in a matter of days, and after securing these ratings, we'll initiate the debt recapitalization process, including CPG issuing its own long-term debt and a separate tender offer for NiSource debt.","On May 14, as I mentioned earlier, NiSource and CPG will host separate webcast to outline a respective growth strategies and associated infrastructure investment opportunities. In early June, we anticipate that we'll confirm the distribution record date, the effectiveness of the Form 10 and the so-called when issued trading period. All of these would culminate with the planned distribution of shares on July 1, 2015, and CPG trading on its own the following day. We look forward to diving deeper into these dates and actions during our May 14 webcast. With those highlights, Steve will now briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results.","Stephen P. Smith","Thanks, again, Bob. As you know, we successfully completed CPPO's IPO in February, which raised approximately $1.2 billion. And just yesterday, we announced the prorated cash distribution of about $0.09 per unit to holders of record as of May 13. This distribution corresponds to the minimum quarterly distribution of $16.75 per unit, or $0.67 annually. This morning, we issued a news release highlighting CPPL's results for the post-IPO period. As you know, the key drivers for the period mirror the key drivers of NiSource and CPG business segment. And our adjusted EBITDA's consistent with our expectations for the quarter. These results are squarely on par with CPPI's strategy for delivering value to unit holders and remains consistence with our guidance for the year that was presented in our registration statement. Bob?","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Steve, and thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Partners. Today, we're ready to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","How big was the gain last year on the mineral sale?","Stephen P. Smith","This is Steve, Paul. It was approximately an aggregate $35 million or so.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's pretax?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And this quarter, we saw off -system sales and industrial decline. I imagine the industrial is steel related, what drove the off-systems sales decline?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes, it was approximately $10 million lower quarter-over-quarter. And it's just lower opportunities to realize off-system sales. I think, industrials managed the winter months much better this quarter than they did last year at this time.","Joseph Hamrock","Paul, this is Joe. On the industrial side, you're right, some of it's steel, but a lot that was related to last year's Polar Vortex and some self-generation, of some of the industrial segment not running, so a little more opportunity for us in that segment last year. So you'll see some flattishness in the industrial sector but nothing as significant relative to plan.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can we have a little more color on the new project in southwest PA that you highlighted?","Robert C. Skaggs","Not a lot more color on it. It's a backbone-gathering system. The need for the system is driven by the robust results of Utica drilling in that region. It's going to be anchored by one key tenant, but likely to have additional folks requiring capacity. It could be as large as a bee a day. So I think, it's again, just evidence that the gas is there, the demand for capacity to get the gas out of the region is there. So we're bullish.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is this hundreds of millions of dollars of investment?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Yes and this is very much a zip code sort of range, but $275 million to $300 million is the bracket we put on it at this point.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, for the past couple of years, May has been the time period when you looked at dividend increases. It's kind of we look for something in conjunction with your webcasts?","Robert C. Skaggs","We're certainly going to be providing detailed on our approach, growth rates and the like on May 14. So yes, stay tuned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","So just on Mountaineer, it just sounds like everything is going well. And when will you be more specific on full kind of cost of project and it's definitely going forward?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. We'll obviously provide additional details during the May 14 webcast. We expect board outs to clear at the end of June. So stay tuned shortly after June for much, much more detail, but certainly, May 14 will be instructive.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Maybe -- and pardon if this needs to wait till May 14. But one thing that you guys seem to be different than maybe many other peer companies is just the extent of organic growth off your system with a huge amount of projects, it seems like you're doubling or tripling your size?","Robert C. Skaggs","Tripling the size.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Tripling the size. How are you thinking of kind of addressing that relative to thinking about peer groups of other pipelines?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. On May 14, we're obviously going to draw the distinction in and around Columbia Pipeline Group. And we will be referencing a group of peers, and as you would expect, they are the usual big players in the space, but we'll certainly be making the point that -- who we think we comp against, how we comp. And so you'll see that complete profile in the 14th.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And when you give visibility out, because in theory if you're looking today, you're a lot different today than you're going to be a few years from now. So will you be able to give visibility out?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, to that point, expect long-term visibility as you're suggesting in your question much of this growth peaks in '17, '18 and then we see cash flowing '19 and '20. So to appreciate the full CPG story, you really need to look at the company and its performance over that longer period of time. So clearly, we expect to do that. We will do that. I think there will be plenty of granularity near term, long term, medium term, so the folks are going to have a good basis to assess the company and its growth.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. That's great. And just -- this might have been addressed, but the appeal in Indiana on the monetization program, just how does this kind of go from here after that court ruling and does it change anything that you're doing in the meantime?","Joseph Hamrock","Steve, this is Joe. It doesn't change anything we're doing. We remain committed to the investments and are working with the stakeholders as we always do to evaluate the options for moving forward, but we see a number of potential options. And we see this generally as a ruling that upholds the core of the statute in the quarter, the framework and just asked the commission to take a look at the long-term plan details to reaffirm the plan ultimately. So we see it as ultimately supportive and a temporary delay.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I don't know if this is a question for you or for Steve or for Joe. But in terms of how we think about the debt recap. I know if I look at the balance sheets you guys put out this morning, and I think about what you've told us, I think at the Analyst Day, it was around a $3 billion debt recap. I heard Steve correct it, it's more like $2.75 billion now, is that right?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes. It's really -- we're really honing in with a sharper pencil on what we need with respect to that debt offering. And you'll recall in the IPO, we were able to raise a bit more money in that transaction upwards of $1.2 billion. So that helped us manage the size of the debt offering. So it's $2.75 billion, and that's going to be used largely for 2 things: to pay an intercompany dividend of around $1.5 billion to NiSource, and then to pay off intercompany debt with NiSource in $1 billion range. And NiSource is going to take that payment, both the dividend and the repayment of intercompany debt and use that to execute a tender offer for approximately $750 million or so of NiSource's debt over the next 30 days or so. So that's the high-level plan on the recapitalization front.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And is that -- Steve, is that just driven by a sort of a targeted debt loan on a pro forma NiSource business as you see it, in conversations with the rating agencies, or what would sort of shape any deviation from that?","Stephen P. Smith","Chris, I don't see a lot of deviation in that calculus. We've worked very diligently with the rating agencies as we always do on our long-term financial plans and feel that the size of this transaction adequately addresses; the balance sheets for both companies going forward and puts them in that solid investment-grade rating range going forward.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. I'm sure we'll have more detail on all fronts on the 14th. So I'll hold a lot of my questions for that, but I do just have one question with regard to the CPPL release this morning. Is the maintenance CapEx number that was reported for the first quarter, is that sort of pro forma for the time period in which CPPL was public, or was that the full quarterly number? And if it was the fourth full quarterly number, is there something -- I know you guys had guided, I think, 130 for the full year, so it looks like it's sort of a slower pace.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, Chris, Bob. The 130 number for the year holds. That's correct number. What about the quarter?","Stephen P. Smith","On the quarter, well, I think, it's both the predecessor company and the post-IPO period. So those 2 pieces are cut into 2. We'll get you that exact number.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, we'll follow up with you, Chris, to confirm.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","We've heard a lot about reduced activity in the Bakken and in other regions. What are you seeing in your territories?","Robert C. Skaggs","Widely publicized that the producers in our neck of the wood have dialed back drilling activity in 2015, and you'll see numbers of 30%, 40%, you'll see some folks that have held the line, if not maybe increased marginally. But we have seen what we consider to be prudent dialing back off of drilling. Having said that, Paul, I think Mountaineer XPress, Gulf Xpress, that new midstream project that we announced today affirms that the producers continue to be very, very bullish on the region, and they still expect production increase year-over-year, and certainly, increase in '17, '18, '19 and the balance of the decade. So prudent dialing back, but still strong, strong commitment to the Marcellus and Utica region.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Bob Skaggs for closing remarks.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks so much. And to everybody on the call, again, we appreciate your participation and your support. And we certainly look forward to chatting with you on May 14, both at NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Group. So thanks. Have a good day. We appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.","Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. In addition, some of the statements made on this recording relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.","With all that out of the way, I'd like to now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As most of you know in the period since our last investor call NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts, area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions. This tragic event has been a humbling experience for all of us at NiSource and Columbia Gas, and we realized that much work lies ahead of us to finish our service restoration in Greater Lawrence, and regain the trust of our customers and the communities we serve.","In Greater Lawrence, we continue to stay keenly focused on helping our customers and restoring the impacted communities. We are committed to restoring service to customers there safely and as quickly as possible.","Safety and the care of our customers is the very foundation of our business. Although, the reviews of this incident are not complete, we are taking steps across our seven-state footprint to enhance system safety. Those measures include procedures and protocols that help guard low pressure systems from the risks that can lead to overpressure incidents with emphasis on enhanced project designs, controls and risk management and enhanced damage prevention protocols. In addition, the plan includes responsive measures such as designs that would automatically shut down an infected system or otherwise protect customer property in the event of an overpressure situation.","Across NiSource, our teams continue working to enhance safety for our customers and communities and our team in Indiana is taking significant steps to advancing our long-term electric business strategy.","Let's now turn to slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments in the third quarter and early fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings, which excludes the impact of the Greater Lawrence event were $0.10 per share in the third quarter versus $0.07 in 2017, which keeps us on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of a $1.26 to a $1.32 for 2018. And we remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.","We are also reaffirming our long-term guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in annual capital investments and 5% to 7% annual growth in net operating earnings and dividends per share through 2020. As of Tuesday, we've replaced all 45 miles of distribution pipeline and all of the service lines necessary to restore service to the impacted communities, in Lawrence, Massachusetts.","Additional work is necessary to make homes and businesses House Ready in order to restore service to all the impacted customers. We're working diligently with our business partners to marshal the resources necessary and adjust our approach to meet our customers' needs and finish this important work safely and as quickly as possible. Meanwhile our teams have continued their disciplined execution of our infrastructure modernization programs and regulatory initiatives across all our states.","Just yesterday, we achieved two milestones in our electric business in Indiana. We submitted our latest Integrated Resource Plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and also filed a base rate case, which supports the plans we outlined in the Integrated Resource Plan. And we continue to execute on both, our environmental investments and our long-term transmission and distribution system modernization program.","In our gas business, we received approval of our rate case settlement in Indiana, and settlements are pending in our Maryland and Pennsylvania base rate cases. We've filed a new rate case in Virginia and withdrew our pending rate case in Massachusetts. In Ohio, we've reached a settlement agreement in our Capital Expenditure Program rider case. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across our footprint and our application for a long-term program extension in Maryland was also approved.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and morning, everyone. Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I'd just like to note that our third quarter GAAP results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with the Greater Lawrence event, and we will likely see additional incident-related expenses in subsequent quarters.","However, we do expect to substantially recover these expenses through insurance, but as of yet have not recorded any insurance recoveries as of September 30th. Excluding this impact, we continue to expect to deliver on our net operating earnings per share guidance for 2018, and deliver on our $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion capital investment plan.","On slide 5, you'll see our non-GAAP net operating earnings were approximately $35 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter, compared with approximately $23 million or $0.07 per share in the same period of 2017.","Through the first nine months of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $321 million or $0.91 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1.32 per share, excluding the impact of CMA event.","Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Looking at slide 6, our Gas Distribution Operations segment had an operating loss of about $3 million for the quarter, compared with an operating loss of about $9 million in the same period of 2017. Operating earnings, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform were about $25 million higher than a year ago, driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenue and lower employee and administrative expenses.","Our Electric Operations segment, covered on slide 7, reported operating earnings of about $123 million for the quarter, compared with operating earnings of about $130 million in the same period of 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, our Electric segment operating earnings were about $7 million higher than a year ago. This increase was primarily due to lower O&M, increased infrastructure investment revenues, offset slightly by decreased industrial usage.","Now turning to slide 8, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our total debt level as of September 30th was about $8.8 billion of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity and our long-term debt was approximately 19 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%. At the end of the third quarter, we maintain net available liquidity of about $1.1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.","I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing plan and recent actions, which are covered on slide 9. As you know in May, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million.","And in June, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million five-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions, and these transactions were completed in mid-July.","These steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, we improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet, and it put us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. This plan includes annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs.","Consistent with this plan, we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with our approach to provide balanced predictable financing for our infrastructure investments and the ATM program filed today allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020.","This year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improve to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.","Now I'll turn the call back to Joe, who will discuss a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on slide 10. New gas distribution rates took effect October 1st, in Indiana following IURC approval of the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to enhance pipeline safety and system reliability. The settlement is expected to ultimately increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million once new rates are fully implemented. Also in Indiana, we continue to execute on our long-term gas modernization program with investments planned through 2020.","Our application for a new seven-year program was dismissed without prejudice by the IURC due to pending legal matters, and we're reviewing options to re-file our application at a later date.","In Pennsylvania, we filed a settlement agreement in our base rate case on August 31st. The settlement supports continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines and reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation.","If approved this filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $26 million. A Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018, with new rates effective in December.","In Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement on October 25th, with parties to our application for an annual Capital Expenditure Program rider. The initial approximately $75 million rider would allow us to begin recovering capital investments and other deferred expenses made between 2011 and 2017, that are not currently recovered under our infrastructure modernization tracker. The settlement also benefits customers by reducing base rates by approximately $23 million to reflect the impact of federal tax reform.","In Virginia, we filed a base rate case with the Virginia State Corporation Commission on August 28th, seeking to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase the annual revenues by $22.2 million, including $8 million in revenues currently collected through the infrastructure tracker. We've requested that new rates go into effect on February 1, 2019, and we expect a Commission order in the second half of 2019.","In Maryland, we're awaiting a Commission decision on our base rate case settlement, which calls for new rates to be in effect later this month. The settlement filed July 31st resolves all, but one issue in the case, and is expected to increase annual revenues by $3.7 million, if approved as filed. The Maryland Commission has approved our application for a five-year extension of our Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement investment plan, or STRIDE, which is our modernization program in the state.","In Massachusetts, we have withdrawn our base rate case application, so that we can remain focused on our system rebuild and service restoration efforts in Greater Lawrence.","Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on slide 12. As I noted earlier, NIPSCO submitted its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC yesterday. The IRP calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next five years and all coal generation to be retired within 10 years. The replacement capacity portfolio is still being defined and options point toward lower cost renewable energy resources such as wind, solar and battery storage technology. The plan is consistent with the company's goal to transition to the most economical cleanest electric supply mix available while maintaining reliability diversity and flexibility for future technology and market changes.","Also yesterday, we filed an electric base rate case. The request seeks changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plants called for in the IRP as well as changes in tariffs to provide service flexibility for industrial customers as they seek to remain competitive in the global marketplace. It also reflects the impact of federal tax reform. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $21 million. And IURC order is anticipated in the third quarter of 2019 with rates effective in September 2019.","Investments in our Coal Combustion Residuals capital projects are progressing and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. These projects include environmental upgrades at our generating facilities to meet current EPA standards. In December 2017, the IURC approved the settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs.","We continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve systems safety and reliability. The IURC-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments, expected to be made through 2022. A settlement was filed October 25th in our latest tracker update request, which remains pending. It benefits customers with an approximately $14 million base rate refund for the January through May 2018 period, reflecting new federal tax rates.","Before we turn to your questions, I'd just like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. Our team is as focused as ever on safety and delivering for our customers across our system. We're executing well on our investment programs and regulatory initiatives and we're managing the impacts of tax reform in a way that sustains our growth plan, maintains all of our financial commitments and provides savings to our customers. We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share, and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2018.","With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow, both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7%, annually, through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. We expect to provide 2019 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter call and provide an updated look at our long-term business plan in mid-2019. As we work through the weeks ahead, our focus remains on restoring service in Greater Lawrence, and thereafter continuing to support the needs of our customers in the area.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Mark?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Joe. Good morning, Don.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just a quick question. I looked at your second quarter deck and the third quarter, the financing plan slide really hasn't changed with regards to the ATM. I think there's some confusion in the market that this announcement today is incremental to the prior ATM. Can you just clarify if that's not the case?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Paul. Good morning. No, this $200 million, $300 million that we outlined in Q2 is still the plan, the ATM that we filed. The new ATM we filed this morning is consistent with that. As you recall, we had used up all of the previous ATM and needed to file a new one.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then looking at slide 12, that's like the cost estimate on the Lawrence incident. How much of this is covered by insurance or what's not going to be covered by insurance?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","So our insurance coverage is fairly broad to cover this type of event and incident. We got total liability coverage of about $800 million and expect substantially all of these costs to be recovered through the process. However, we did not book a receivable at our September 30th close, because it's early in the process. We really are in Q4, incurring most of these expenses and felt that it was prudent to really get through seeing the claims and the cost before booking a receivable, which we'll do as Q4.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","And Paul, just to clarify slide 12 also includes the capital expenditures related to the system rebuild. Those obviously would not be insurance-related costs.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Understood, understood.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning ,Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, just to clarify the last one real quickly. So when you said substantively all of it would be recoverable from insurance, that's under the additional incident-related expenses of $415 million to $450 million and the $180 million to $210 million?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That's correct Julien. It's both of those categories really from an accounting perspective and how we need to book show that from an accounting perspective, we put it into two categories around third-party claims and other expenses. But they are all event expenses that we expect to be recovered through insurance.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, excellent. And then just a follow-up on that, in terms of the rate case timing, obviously, withdrawn (00:23:39) it. What's the expectation with respect to going back in Mass, once this is said and done and filing for recovery of whatever you deem appropriate. And then at the same time, how are the rating agencies viewing and how are you viewing your balance sheet given the cash flow timing issues, perhaps related to insurance here.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah, Julien. It's Joe. I'll take the first part. Our focus is on the restoration effort and getting customers back in service. Those are questions for another day related to the ultimate regulatory plan for the investments we've been making.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","From a financing standpoint, obviously, it's a large event that we are financing now. We have significant liquidity to finance this event. However, we are looking at ensuring that we hit our metrics that we've promised at year-end here 2018 and assessing any needs to make sure we hit that. But, again, it's all timing around financing, because we do expect to recover the claims expenses through insurance.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","One quick clarification on capital spend with the IRP, when do you expect to more fully delineate some of the timeline for generation associated with that NIPSCO filing, specific investment (00:25:06).","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. That's a work in progress. Julien, that's one of the areas that we expect to update when we do further look probably mid-2019.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, excellent. Thank you all very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Joe and Don. You guys clearly talked about the expenses related to the incident in Massachusetts and definitely we appreciate the details there, but is there a way to think about costs that might not directly be related to that and perhaps other parts of the company, or perhaps corporate costs outside of what you've outlined here that could spill into 2019 or future years?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question, Chris, and good morning. It's a little early for that. That's the area that we would expect to delineate more in our 2019 guidance on our Q4 call.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But we should assume that there might be some pressure there that wouldn't necessarily be able to be offset by cost discipline in other areas. Is that fair?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","I don't know that, I'd go to that extent. You know we've got work to do to pull all those details together, but I don't see it that way at this point.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","And I'd say \u2013 I'd add that, we don't expect that this changes our long-term guidance of 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth. As we came out last year committing to flat O&M expense after 2017, and we still expect to be able to meet that commitment.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then in Massachusetts specifically clearly out of the gate there were a plenty of negative headlines directed toward the company and I think the DPU even came out with some sort of suspension of work request for you \u2013 and since that time, could you characterize how your dialogue has been with both, the political and regulatory community there?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. You recognize some of the issues that we've worked through over the last several weeks since the incident. We worked day-by-day with the leaders in the state and the community and our partners across this to all stay focused on restoration of service to the community and the customers in the community. And I would say that is a very collaborative effort working very closely together.","We will have work to do as we get beyond service restoration as well with the ongoing effort to replace some of the equipment that we'll repair immediately. So this has got this has got a longer tail on it than just service restoration and we've, we've made a long-term commitment to rebuild trust and confidence in the community and with the leaders in this state.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Would you say that there has been an ongoing dialogue there since the initial incident?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Oh yeah we're, we're day-to-day working very closely together.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Insoo Kim - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning.","Insoo Kim - Goldman Sachs","Just on the financing side, it seems like you're leaving some room open for potentially more preferred equity or subordinated debt, is that kind of an option for this as well as next year as a financing vehicle away from additional equity or file ATMs (00:28:54) to support your credit metric guidance for 2019 and 2020?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you. Yes. It was certainly a good transaction, the preferred equity that we did in May, we continue to look at that option as a long-term lower cost way to provide equity content versus issuing common equity. So absolutely. However we will continue to compare that versus issuing through the ATM program as well as regular debt financing.","Insoo Kim - Goldman Sachs","Understood. And then, given what's happened in Massachusetts, do you see as you look forward to the next few years, the mix of your future, CapEx and rate base items, leaning a bit more towards gas versus electric or does that not really change that much?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","So I wouldn't think at this point, the mix is going to change in any significant way. I think we're certainly working through our electric generation plan and we'll be able to provide an update on that in mid-2019. But at this point, I don't see a significant departure from the current mix.","Insoo Kim - Goldman Sachs","Understood. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just...","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Just to clarify better on \u2013 you mentioned the rating agency commitments. So, what are some of the options? You mentioned kind of options to make sure you meet them for this year. Is it just kind of timing of your ATM or is it other things that you might do if you need to?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. I really think it's certainly timing if we were to do any type of transaction with equity content, it really is timing to support the restoration efforts in Massachusetts. But the ATM program that we filed as well as if we were to issue any type of preferred or equity content security that would support hitting our metrics at yearend.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","(00:31:27) we're looking at as we evaluate cash flows in metrics.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And as you kind of step back and look at your whole system, are you reviewing kind of timing of replacing pipes or other operational changes kind of more broadly as a company in your other states?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Steve. We're always reviewing that. It's always a risk-based evaluation. We do that on an ongoing basis. As I noted earlier in the call, we have also reviewed the other profile around low pressure systems and we expect to make some investments along that line of assets as well in the near-future, but we're still working through the details on that and would expect to share more on that in the near-future.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","But, I would add that, if you think about our programs in each state, we'll typically have five- and seven-year commitments around our infrastructure investments. And so, I would not expect a material change state-to-state as we are \u2013 do intend to hit those commitments on those programs.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks. Have a good day.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Shar.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Don, do you have \u2013 just around the ongoing O&M expense? I mean, presumably you are doing a lot more inspections through your system given sort of the design failure. Do you have sort of an estimate of what could be ongoing in the near-term at least?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","So, no. That's something that we are evaluating right now as we look at our operations and the needs. Joe, outlined some of the steps that we're taking around low pressure systems and we'll be able to provide more information in the future on that. But at this point, don't expect there to be significant O&M that would change our long-term O&M plan.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then just on Massachusetts. When do you expect sort of everyone to sort of come back to their homes right. And then, again, just remind us how many are still outside of their homes?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. We announced last week a revision to the original schedule that now has the ultimate return between December 2 and December 16, though we work every day to accelerate that schedule and we're still pushing for earlier than those dates with resource redeployment of additional resources bringing in additional contractors. So it's an urgent focus across the entire team to work towards an accelerated return home for those affected customers. It's very disruptive for them. In terms of the number who are out right now, subject to check. I need to look at the most recent, but we have \u2013 we provide daily stats on the number of folks that are in alternative housing and a number of folks that are affected by this and still not able to function in their homes normally. So, as we as we sit here today, we've restored about 20% of the affected customers and we work with each of the affected customers to be sure they're accommodated.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Okay. Thanks, so much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning, Joe and Don.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Michael.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. So just to be clear, the equity plan is unchanged essentially going forward, and that includes the expectation for an accelerated capital replacement program that's happening right now in Massachusetts. So that, you know, in other words, there's no additional equity that you think might be needed as a result of accelerating the program.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That is correct. We executed on this work in Massachusetts. And just think about it from a resource standpoint, we brought a lot of resources over from other states to support this effort in Massachusetts. And so, we did balance out a little bit across the states, so that our overall capital plan doesn't change significantly. There were also I'd say some lower priority corporate and IT initiatives that we delayed that supported not really changing our capital plan and\/or our financing need.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And also for the guidance, the guidance is unchanged for EPS 5% to 7% growth, but is that \u2013 are you still also trying to say that you'll be in the middle of that guidance or is there any change or shift in that end of the range?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","For 2018, well, I would say...","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","...just going forward, the 5% to 7%. Yeah.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. So, 5% to 7%, yeah, I think if you recall in thinking about the range of outcomes for our business, it's primarily driven by our infrastructure programs and 75% of that is tracked. And so, the movement within the range is really around regulatory outcomes and timing of those outcomes, O&M expense and financing costs. So, I think this doesn't change that. This event does not change that from a long-term standpoint.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And has anything changed regarding your plan for an Analyst Day next year, maybe sometime around the end of the first quarter or?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. As I noted on the call earlier, we're now looking at mid-2019 for an Analyst Day, and an update on the longer range plan.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. I missed that...","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","That's all right.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Thank you. I certainly admit I haven't looked at the IRP yet that you submitted yesterday, but it appears from your slides that there you're accelerating your coal plant retirements from what you had previously indicated, which is certainly not unique in the industry.","Joe, I guess my question is, what drove you to that decision to accelerate coal plant retirements? Was it the more renewable energy or the cost of renewable energy was lower than you thought going into this, was it the discussions with the Commission? Was it just customer feedback, first that. And then I guess related to that is, do you have the ability to downsize your environmental upgrades at Michigan City in Schahfer, because it would appear that you'd be retiring those units earlier than you had originally planned?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Charles. And thanks for the question. We did as you noted, accelerate relative to the last Integrated Resource Plan, accelerate the plan for coal retirements with now all of the Schahfer stations slated for retirement within the next five years, and the Michigan City unit within 10 years. And it was driven by I would characterize it as all of the factors that you noted, a rigorous economic analysis looking at the long run cost, expected cost of all available sources, including continuing to run the existing assets, providing for environmental retrofits known to comply with current regulations. And then to look at \u2013 we ran an RFP earlier in the year that we shared with stakeholders for and all of the above supply portfolio to replace capacity. And when we ran all of that analysis and looked at all of the options, what emerged as the best solution or the most viable solution is the plan that we put out yesterday with the IRP, with that further acceleration of coal retirement.","And as we sit here today in expectation that renewables would be the most viable, most economic and cleanest supply portfolio for us. We will continue to evaluate that side of it as we step through time. We'll look at what's available in the marketplace now, and then we'll take another look as we get closer to the timeline of needing to replace capacity across the next 10 years. So, that's an ongoing evaluation. And so the rate case that was also filed yesterday is really designed to complement that Integrated Resource Plan to reset the depreciation rates, to now acknowledge the accelerated retirement plan.","And with your last question, you may recall that we filed last year a CPCN and for both the CCR and the ELG, both the coal ash and the water rule compliance and we have proceeded with the CCR, but we'll continue that, because that compliance date is upon us.","On the ELG side, the water rule, we'll continue to evaluate that and likely would not make those investments under this plan consistent with what you indicated in your question. So, it's a comprehensive look at all of the options, all of the economics. And coming up with the solution that best fits our expected needs and our customers' supply needs.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","So, it sounds like though the IRP is, you're coordinating that what your base rate cases, so there won't be any risk of a stranded investment here, where you recently made some environmental upgrades and you're stuck with the \u2013 you're prevented from recovering all of it, correct?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","That's the idea, to get the rate case to set the depreciation rates for the existing assets, so that we can move forward in time with other decisions based on having established that foundation.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a follow up from the line Charles Fishman. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Well, since nobody else had one let me just pop in one more quick one. You've always included slide, something like slide 14 that shows roughly a 75% of your investments are recovered within 12 months.","You had this tracker, I forget was it approved in Ohio or you're proposing it I guess in Ohio, or you reached a settlement? I'm sorry, that includes this new tracker. Would that increase the percentage of investments recovered under trackers, so you'd be going over 75% now?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. That is correct, Charles. That portion of our investment in Ohio typically would have gone through a base rate case. And so now, from the Ohio perspective, almost all of the investments would be recovered through a tracker or a rider.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","I mean, in Ohio significant, so it could conceivably be touching 80% of your investments covered by trackers now. Is that \u2013 my thinking about that correctly?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","I'd have to look at it. We can get back to you and we'll certain will update that....","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. But I got the...","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","...once that order is approved. Yeah.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","I got the direction right.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yes. Thank you.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey guys, just wanted to follow up here on this IRP just a little bit more detail if you can. Curious, I mean, you have a pretty healthy amount of solar in that IRP, especially even in the near dated years for 2023. How are you thinking about your ability to own that, and do you have any constructs rate basing it, because obviously that has a \u2013 could have a potential meaningful impact?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. We are looking at opportunities to own that as well as PPA. When we ran the IRP or the RFP, this summer, bids came in for both, PPA as well as ownership. We're looking at what that opportunities are around ownership, and in firming up those bids.","I mean what that structure would be to include that in rate base. So, that will be part of our plan and how we would come out next year to talk about the future investments and generation, but we think certainly opportunity to own.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And you would expect that given the 2023 timeline for that IRP that you'd be issuing RFPs in the 2019 and 2020 timeframe to take advantage of IT save (00:45:57)?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","I don't know if we've come out what a date yet on the next RFP, but certainly we would need to likely. I'd say you're probably right, it's probably in the 2021 timeframe to be in place by 2023.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Paul T.

My name is Carissa, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed.","Glen L. Kettering","Thank you, Carissa, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of NiSource, I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Here this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations. The focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 and to provide a business update. We'll then open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we'll refer to the supplemental slides available on nisource.com.","I'd like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning those risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Glen. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. For today's agenda, first and foremost, we'll review another year of strong performance. Our 2012 highlights reflect the continued strength of our strategy, as well as our team's proven ability to execute on that strategy and build shareholder value. We'll also update you on more recent accomplishments and ongoing initiatives. And finally, we'll discuss our 2013 financial outlook and key commitments. We'll also have plenty of time for your questions.","Let's start on Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning. As we noted in this morning's release, 2012 was yet another year of disciplined execution across all facets of our business strategy. As you know, that strategy is anchored by a deep and growing inventory of infrastructure-focused capital investments that generate significant value for our customers, shareholders and other key stakeholders. For the sixth year in a row, our team's execution of that strategy generated earnings growth squarely in line with our guidance, and for the fourth consecutive year, it produced total shareholder returns that outperformed the utility indices.","","Specifically, NiSource generated non-GAAP earnings of $1.46 per share, well within our guidance range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share, and strong year-over-year growth of more than 10%. We also generated total shareholder return","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Your conference will resume momentarily.","You may proceed.","Robert C. Skaggs","We apologize. Dreaded glitch, our phone was obviously disconnected for some reason. In any way, we apologize. And let me just go back to the performance, financial performance for 2012, and I'll begin the narrative at that point, we'll just carry on. Again, we apologize.","NIPSCO generated non-GAAP earnings of $1.46 per share, well within our guidance range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share, and strong year-over-year growth of more than 10%. We also generated total shareholder return of approximately 8.5% and increased our dividend for the first time in more than a decade. That strong momentum has continued in 2013, as earlier this month, our stock price reached a 10-year high. As I noted, the foundation of NiSource's success over the last several years has been the team's demonstrated ability to execute on our inventory of infrastructure-focused capital investment opportunities.","In 2012, those capital investments reached nearly $1.6 billion. Over the balance of the call, I'll discuss how we are continuing to enhance and expand that investment portfolio which will produce a record capital investment program of about $1.8 billion in 2013.","Many of you may recall that we outlined key elements of NiSource's elevated investment strategy at our 2012 Investor Day last September. In particular, we identified and expanded inventory of accretive infrastructure investment opportunities for the next 2 decades totaling $25 billion to $30 billion. Those opportunities will drive an annual capital investment run rate of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, sustainable annual earnings growth of between 5% and 7% and an annual dividend growth rate of between 3% and 5%. You may also recall that we emphasized that we would fund our enhanced program in a balanced fashion and we would religiously guard our investment-grade credit rating.","By way of an update, we are well on our way in executing that elevated plan. I'll touch on several of our team's recent advances this morning including, of course, a watershed event for us, the FERC's January 24 approval of Columbia Gas Transmission's landmark infrastructure modernization settlement. I'll speak more to the implications of that settlement in a moment. But suffice it to say that our Columbia pipeline team is now poised to make significant and ongoing investments that will modernize our system and benefit our customers and other key stakeholders for decades to come.","At our gas utilities, we also continue to see strong execution on our industry-leading infrastructure modernization programs and in our Indiana electric business, solid progress on our significant environmental investments. In a snapshot, yet another very strong year for NiSource. We added to our growing track record for delivering results, and we have a well-established, highly-visible plan to continue building shareholder value through long-term, sustainable investment and earnings growth.","So with that backdrop, let's take a closer look at our 2012 results starting with our financial progress on Slide 4. As you can see, NiSource delivered net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $427 million or $1.46 per share in 2012. That compares with about $369 million or $1.32 per share for 2011. Our operating earnings for the year increased by about $125 million over 2011. On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations for the year was about $411 million or $1.41 per share compared to about $295 million or $1.05 per share in 2011. Schedules 1 and 2 to our earnings release shows the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items.","Turning to our individual business unit results, let's start with our pipeline business summarized on Slide 5. Prior to highlighting the results, I want to mention a naming change you'll notice going forward. We're rebranding our NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage group as the Columbia Pipeline Group, or CPG. This leverages the historic strength of our Columbia Gas Transmission and Columbia Gulf brands in the tradition of service and reliability they represent.","From an earnings standpoint, our pipeline group's performance continue to be solid, benefiting from growth projects placed into service, as well as Columbia Gulf rate case that we settled in November 2011. We generate operating earnings of about $398 million in 2012 compared to $360 million in 2011. As I mentioned a few moments ago, the most significant highlight is the landmark system modernization agreement that the team completed in 2012 and was approved by the FERC last month. That approval establishes a clear path forward. With an identified project stream and a balanced transparent recovery mechanism, this long-term program ultimately is expected to involve roughly $4 billion to $5 billion in investment to ensure the ongoing safety, reliability and flexibility for Columbia Gas Transmission system.","Under the settlement, beginning immediately, we'll invest about $1.5 billion in the first 5 years in addition to $100 million in annual maintenance investment. The program truly is a win-win for our customers, the company and all our key stakeholders. Our pipeline and midstream project development teams also are continuing to develop and execute on infrastructure investment opportunities in existing and new markets and midstream projects to serve the Utica and Marcellus Shale regions. As a side, I'll note that as part of our supplemental slides, we've outlined the various infrastructure projects currently in flight and plan. By the way, you'll find similar slides for each of our business units.","In our midstream business, our Big Pine Gathering System will be placed fully into service by April of this year. Supported by a long-term gathering agreement with XTO Energy, the $160 million project will transport up to 425 million cubic feet per day of Marcellus production. Also in midstream, Pennant Midstream, LLC, our joint venture with Hilcorp, continues to make progress with its pipeline and processing facilities and remains on schedule to be completed and in-service by the end of 2013. NiSource is responsible for $150 million of the total investment in the project's first phase.","In connection with our other resource development-based arrangement with Hilcorp, test wells were drilled in 2012 to support the development of the hydrocarbon potential on more than 100,000 combined acres in the Utica\/Point Pleasant Shale formation. Although the evaluation process continues, preliminary results are quite encouraging and indicate liquids content consistent with active wells in the area. Delineation and additional test wells will continue in 2013 with a full development program launched later this year. We anticipate the 2013 development program will include the drilling of 10 to 20 wells.","Recall, NiSource will invest alongside Hilcorp in the development of the acreage, owning both the working and overriding royalty interest, all of the Hilcorp NiSource acreage is dedicated to the Pennant Midstream project.","On our regulated pipelines, the team also is moving ahead on several projects that will help provide liquidity and market access for new shale gas production. These include the East Side and West Side Expansion project, combined investments of more than $400 million, which in aggregate will add approximately 800,000 decatherms per day of new transportation capacity on our systems.","Also in late December, Columbia Gulf initiated a nonbinding, open season for its proposed Cameron Access Project in South Louisiana. With access to various supply basins, the project would improve reliability for shippers by transporting natural gas supplies directly into the Cameron LNG terminal via new pipeline from Columbia Gulf System. With a projected in-service date of mid-2017, initial capacity and investment will be determined based on the results of the open season.","As you can see, our pipeline team is maintaining a sharp focus on both the core growth and modernization projects, while pursuing complementary and accretive midstream projects. This balanced approach is designed to meet the evolving needs of the marketplace, ensuring the reliability, integrity and modernization of our infrastructure and leveraging our assets and mineral position in the shale basins.","For 2013 capital spending, we'll invest at least $700 million in our pipeline storage and midstream assets, and we'll certainly consider additional investments for the right projects.","Let's now shift to Indiana and our electric business as summarized on Slide 6. For NIPSCO, 2012, the company's 100th anniversary was right in line with our plan to deliver on our core customer, reliability and environmental initiatives, while focusing on long-term investment and growth. During the year, NIPSCO delivered strong operational and financial performance and advanced several near- and long-term growth in modernization investments. Operating earnings came in at about $238 million in 2012 compared to about $202 million in 2011. In addition, NIPSCO continued to introduce an array of new customer programs, including an air-conditioning cycling program, a recently improved green power rate program and a program offering customer incentives for those who drive electric vehicles. And most notably, NIPSCO continues to stay on track with significant environmental investments at its electric generation facilities. The company's more than $500 million FGD project at its Schahfer generating station remains on schedule and on budget. These new units will be placed into service in the fourth quarter of this year and in 2014.","At the company's Michigan City generating station, preconstruction engineering and design work has begun for another $250 million FGD project. Construction will start during March of this year. NIPSCO also is moving forward with an overall investment of up to $0.5 billion for 2 fully-approved electric transmission projects in Northern Indiana that will go into service during the latter part of the decade. These projects will strengthen the Midwest electrical infrastructure, while supporting economic development and providing new jobs. The 2 approved projects are in process, and we'll see additional planning and outreach activities in 2013.","On the legislative front, our NIPSCO team, together with other state utilities, is working tirelessly to advance legislation that would improve the efficiency of the regulatory process, as well as establish a framework for recovery of costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investments. And that initiative is progressing. Last week, Senate Bill 560 was passed by the Indiana Senate, and we expect the House to pick up the bill in March. Parallel with these efforts, we're developing a long-term modernization program for NIPSCO's electric transmission and distribution infrastructure. That effort will include modernization of our core electrical system, including replacement of transformers, poles, lines and other vital equipment. Stay tuned for more information related to this initiative later in 2013. You can find additional information about these and other planned investments at NIPSCO in our supplemental slides.","All told, in 2013 we'll invest more than $430 million at NIPSCO, primarily focused on environmental investments and maintenance of our existing electric infrastructure.","Let's turn now to our Gas Distribution Operations, or NGD, discussed on Slide 7. Our NGD team continues to deliver strong, steady results from its core business strategy, which is centered on aligning long-term infrastructure enhancement programs with complementary customer programs and regulatory initiatives. For the year, NGD operating earnings came in at about $441 million compared to about $425 million in 2011. Net revenues were up about $37 million, excluding trackers, primarily reflecting regulatory and infrastructure programs. The broad array of modernization projects across NGD continues to generate value for stakeholders and sustainable earnings growth. Part of a more than $10 billion long-term modernization program, NGD invested nearly $400 million in these infrastructure programs in 2012.","In the regulatory arena, on February 8, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania reached a unanimous settlement in principle with parties in its rate case. The parties will submit a joint petition for approval to the PUC by March 18. At that time, we'll provide additional details about the settlement terms. But what we can say at this time is that we're very pleased with the settlement, which is in line with our expectations. You'll recall the case is tailored after Pennsylvania's recently enacted Act 11, which reflects fully projected future test year under which the company proposes to recover its infrastructure investments through June 2014. Rates are anticipated to be placed into service in July of this year.","On the legislative front, on February 14, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation allowing natural gas utilities to defer required O&M costs for distribution integrity management plans, or DIMP, for recovery in future rate cases.","And in Maryland, on February 7, Senate Bill 8 and its companion, House Bill 89, passed. The 2 identical bills will now go to the opposite chamber and be assigned to committee. The bills permit gas utilities to file a pipeline replacement plan to qualify for a fixed annual surcharge to recover associated costs. If passed and signed by the Governor, the act will take effect June 1, 2013.","Once again, our Gas Distribution game plan is well established, straightforward and transparent. Sustained earnings growth through long-term investment -- infrastructure investments supported by customer programs and progressive regulatory models. Total capital investment in NGD reached nearly $650 million in 2012, similar level as targeted for 2013. Like our other 2 business units, we've added additional information about our infrastructure investments at NGD in our supplemental slides.","Now a few comments on our 2013 earnings guidance and a bit more perspective on our record capital program, summarized on Slide 8. First and foremost, we're maintaining our commitment to long-term and sustainable earnings growth in the range of 5% to 7% per year. NiSource's non-GAAP earnings outlook for 2013 is $1.50 to $1.60 per share with the midpoint representing 6% growth over 2012 EPS. Again, fueling this will be our record $1.8 billion capital investment program, the lion's share of which is comprised of value-adding growth and modernization investments.","The NiSource plan reflects yet another well-designed step-up in investment with the largest increase for 2013 being our modernization and growth initiatives of our pipeline group, the great addition to the foundation of accretive, value-adding growth in environmental investments at our other 2 businesses.","These and other investments will serve to enhance the long-term value of our assets for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and other important constituencies. Again, as we continue to execute our investment-driven business strategy, I can assure you that we'll remain balanced, disciplined and transparent in how we fund our capital requirements. I might add parenthetically that our funding efforts received a number of recent boosts in the form of the $120 million in proceeds from the sale of our noncore retail services business, and we expected $150 million to $200 million benefit from the availability of bonus depreciation in 2013.","Finally, we remain true to our unwavering financial commitments, sustainable earnings growth, a strong and growing dividend, strong liquidity and investment-grade credit. So as our 2012 results and 2013 outlook attest, the NiSource team is continuing to build on a strong track record of delivering collaborative regulatory and commercial solutions, while making disciplined investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis.","With the full support of our Board of Directors, I'm convinced that we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to deliver on our commitments. As always, we'll communicate with you and all of our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com.","Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource.","Now, Carissa, let's open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Faisel from Citi.","Robert C. Skaggs","Sorry about the glitch.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, no, that's pretty -- we've heard it all, so there's no problem at all. On the -- a couple of things. First on the Gas Transmission and Storage business, I know you guys talked about it in the press release and you talked about it in your prepared remarks, the other revenue credit category grew quite substantially year-over-year in the quarter. Can you just go into a little more granularity in terms of what was in that number so we get a better idea of how this is going to kind of move going forward?","Robert C. Skaggs","Hey, Faisel, just to be clear in the question, you're talking about the other revenue category for 2012?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, fourth quarter 2012.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You have a big number in the other revenue category. And I think you described it as the royalty revenue and all the stuff that's going on in some of the midstream business, but maybe I'm wrong.","Robert C. Skaggs","It's actually a FERC tracker that relates to the purchase and sale of incidental gas on the system. And I believe that the acronym is OTRA, but it's a tracker that just goes in and out of revenue.","Stephen P. Smith","And it's offset in O&M, so there is no net benefit.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So then where does all the gathering and royalty revenue and all those sort of deals show up then?","Stephen P. Smith","It would show up in the transmission segment, in demand and commodity revenues, for example.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes.","Stephen P. Smith","If you look year-over-year, the transmission segment increased its revenues, net revenues by approximately $28 million or so, and that's where the midstream activities would reside.","Robert C. Skaggs","And new projects and midstream activities.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure, I understand. Okay. And then on the test wells you guys talked about in the joint venture, can you give us any sort of update on what those wells came up with? Was it dry gas, liquids? I mean, what are you guys looking at?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. The gasses -- the gas is wet. We're not going to disclose specifics on flow rates and the like, but it's high gas, about 1,200 BTU. And we've said in the past that it's about 6 GPM, and that continues to be representative of what we're seeing in the test wells.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is it liquids component? Is it condensate, or is it NGLs?","Robert C. Skaggs","NGLs.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, all right, understood. And then on the reversal of Columbia Gulf, what is part of the line, we've seen the Columbia full pricing versus Henry Hub pricing kind of come pretty close to parity. Your reversal doesn't come online till 2014. I'm just wondering if you can give us any sort of idea of how you think basis is going to move over the next -- in the next 12 months or so until your reversal comes online. Do you expect the pricing in the Marcellus area to get the disconnect from the rest of the market? Or do you expect to still trade at parity or premium to Hub?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. I just really can't give you a good sense on price. My crystal ball is not that good. What I can say is the team continues to explore opportunities to optimize Columbia Gulf, and that includes moving gas from north to south. And so you'll continue to see us prospecting along those lines, and the West Side project is a great example of what we're going to continue to try to do.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And last question from me. You mentioned that you're changing the name of natural -- the name of the Natural Gas Transmission group back to Columbia Gas Transmission. Is there anything we should read into that besides branding? I mean, is this...","Robert C. Skaggs","No, purely branding. The marketplace has always considered Columbia Gas pipeline, TICO, Columbia Gulf, and so we're just going to leverage what's a well-established brand in the market.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So there's no -- there's nothing here that would be a precursor to naming of another company or a subsidiary of the company or anything like that?","Robert C. Skaggs","No, no. No, don't read anything else into it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst of BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just on the FERC approval of the Columbia settlement, were there any modifications? Or was there any couching language that they put out there? And I asked that in the sense that as we look 5 years down the road, we'll be re-upping this basically be just commercial, essentially, for FERC? Or was there any kind of regulatory reticence at all?","Robert C. Skaggs","Carl, you broke up at the very end, but let me begin at the first part of your question. The order is absolutely clean. There was some language about providing guidance on how to package settlements, but that was FERC discussion as opposed to point on our transaction or our agreements. So very, very clean, without condition. And then I think you asked about re-upping the settlement after the initial 5-year term. And clearly, that's our intent. We're going to have to execute the program efficiently and work with our customers and other stakeholders closely. But the settlement provides us the opportunity to renew, and that's what we intend to do.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. No, no, you answer that. Sorry, I broke up there. The second question is really on Cameron Access, and understanding that it's early days. I'm not sure if there's any framework as far as our book ending of investment potential, but -- that could be done. Or if not, should we be thinking about this in a sense of basically a lateral pipeline off of Columbia Gulf? Or could this be a larger project for instance, embedding kind of an upsized West Side Expansion, where we're taking more gas form Marcellus?","Robert C. Skaggs","For Cameron Access, think of it the way you described it as a lateral of Columbia Gulf System. And we're not at a point to provide book-ins on the amount of investment. We just make the observation that we tend to go for singles and doubles and bite-size projects, and leave it at that.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. And then last question, if I could, and this is just more on NIPSCO, and very much appreciate the legislative update with Senate Bill 560. And I think last time we spoke in December, you didn't seem to kind of get a sense if there was any big critical mass of opposition developing in the House. Is that still a fair statement? Or as we've gotten closer to it, has anything -- an opposition emerged from that?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, I'll just say it's the legislative process, Carl. The Senate passed the Bill 37,13, so a very healthy margin. We do believe that there is good support for the legislation in the direction of infrastructure in Indiana.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What did the retail business contribute in '12, the business that was sold to AGL?","Stephen P. Smith","Paul, this is Steve. Approximately $0.03 a share.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And how many -- you spoke of encouraging results. How many wells were drilled?","Robert C. Skaggs","We had  handful of test wells being drilled. We're bringing online 2 production wells, and we're in the process of drilling 2 production wells. And when I say we, Hilcorp is actually doing all of that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And any update for plans on the second cryo plant you have an ups on?","Robert C. Skaggs","No update at this point. We're still bullish and optimistic about phases 2 and 3 of Pennant, but it's just too early to provide any specificity around timing, size and that sort of thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Edwards of Credit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just real quick. I take it the year-over-year lower volumes on Columbia Gulf, that's because of the growing production up in the Marcellus?","Robert C. Skaggs","Also weather. Really warm weather conditions in 2012, so that, too, had an impact. It was not trivial, I would add.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then okay, similar -- I guess, similar for the lower wholesale electricity sales? The reason why I'm asking because it looks like -- on the weather, it looked like this year wasn't as cold as last year. I mean, it was a little bit colder than last year, excuse me, at least, on the Columbia Gulf thing. So I guess -- I mean, you are having pushback from going production in the Northeast, correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","Oh, yes. Oh, sure. We're seeing the impact of Marcellus on the Columbia Gulf volumes. And I mentioned earlier, that's why the team continues to look at opportunities to optimize Columbia Gulf and move gas north to south, and the West Side Expansion is a good example and the team pursues other opportunities.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I'm sorry, and then on the wholesale electricity sales, those were down. Is that a weather issue also? Or...","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, we're going to have to get back to you with specificity around that. Frankly, I don't track it that much because it's just not a big part of the business. But it could be a variety of factors. And we'll have to ask Randy to provide that detail.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On Senate Bill 560, what came out of the Senate? Is that -- does that address generation and distribution? Or was that trim down coming out of the Senate?","Robert C. Skaggs","It's primarily T and D sort of investment opportunities, as well as natural gas and in particular expansion of gas, natural gas service to rural areas or underserved portions of Indiana.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So this would be a tracker that would emulate like the gas tracker pipeline?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Modernization investments and transmission distributions, storage, natural gas, rehabilitation and the like. That's what the tracker is designed to promote those sorts of investments. Legislation also provides for future-looking test year, statutory deadline to deal with rate cases, things like are included in the legislation as it currently is drafted.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And it's now going to the House?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, the bills will cross over from the Senate to the House and vice versa in March.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned an AC cycling program. Is that one of these programs with the smart thermostats?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. For the most part, it is.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And who owns those? Do you? Or is that something that can go into rate base or not material?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, we own those. And by the way, they're not material to the overall investment opportunity, very small program.","Operator","And there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Skaggs for closing remarks.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thank you. And thanks for everyone participating this morning.

I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Randy Hulen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Randy G. Hulen","Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of NiSource, I would like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As you know, the focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the first quarter of 2014, as well as provide an overall business update. We will then open up the call to your questions. At times during the call, we will refer to the supplemental slides that are available on nisource.com.","I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thank you, Randy. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. As we noted in this morning's release, our team delivered another quarter of solid performance. Today, we'll summarize a number of execution highlights and discuss how they position NiSource for continued growth in 2014 and beyond.","Then Steve Smith will review our financial results. We'll also provide updates on key initiatives across each of our businesses, and, of course, we'll leave plenty of time for your questions.","With that agenda in mind, let's start with some key takeaways from the quarter. You'll see these listed on Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning.","As you saw is in this morning's news release, our NiSource team delivered another strong quarter. Each of our business units steadily advanced our well-established agenda of regulatory and legislative programs, paired with significant infrastructure investments and long-term system enhancements.","In particular, at Columbia Pipeline Group, we saw a strong quarter of pipeline and midstream infrastructure project origination and execution. Touching on a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered earnings per share of $0.82 in the first quarter, that's in line with our 2014 guidance of $1.61 to $1.71 per share, non-GAAP.","In addition, our 2014 capital program target -- targeted at $2.2 billion remained solidly on track, with our infrastructure investment programs now moving into high gear.","On the regulatory front, we placed new rates in effect in Massachusetts, following the decision by the DPU in early March. Our team also filed a new rate case in Pennsylvania as we continued to deliver system modernization investments in the Commonwealth.","And as we mentioned in our year-end call, we received FERC approval to begin recovery of our Columbia Gas Transmission modernization investments from 2013. We began recovering on the first $300 million of those investments in February.","In parallel, with these foundational regulatory and system modernization programs, we continued to originate new growth in midstream opportunities across our pipeline segment. We've had significant developments on that front, which I'll touch on in a few minutes.","With those highlights, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to take a closer look at our financial results on Page 4 of our supplemental slides.","Stephen P. Smith","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, the NiSource team delivered a strong first quarter. We generated annual non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $258 million or $0.82 per share, which compares to about $215 million or $0.69 per share in 2013. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $80 million when compared to the same period in 2013.","On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $266 million for the first quarter of 2014 versus $216 million in 2013.","At the segment level, you will see that each of our 3 core business units delivered solid earnings growth during the first quarter. Columbia Pipeline Group, or CPG, delivered operating earnings of about $159 million compared to about $133 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $20 million, primarily as a result of growth projects placed in service and increased mineral rights royalty revenue.","Earnings for the quarter were also up at NIPSCO's electric operations, where earnings came in at about $74 million, compared with about $65 million for 2013.","Net revenues, again, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by $18 million, primarily due to an increase in off-system sales, environmental investment cost recovery and higher industrial margins. And finally, our Gas Distribution business unit delivered about $280 million in operating earnings compared to about $233 million for the prior year.","Net revenues, excluding trackers, were up about $54 million, primarily due to regulatory and infrastructure replacement efforts. All in all, another solid quarter. Full details are available on our earnings release posted online this morning.","Now, turning to Slide 5, I'd like to quickly touch on our financing and liquidity highlights. As you can see, we retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.7 billion of net available liquidity at the end of the first quarter. And as Bob mentioned, I am pleased to reiterate that our capital program for 2014 remains on track at about $2.2 billion. As we've indicated in the past, the majority -- actually 77% of our investments remain focused on track and other revenue-generating opportunities. In addition, we are on track to deliver earnings squarely within our 2014 guidance range of $1.61 to $1.71 per share.","Looking ahead, our financial strategy continues to be balanced, straightforward and fully aligned with our robust long-term capital investment outlook, and we remain strongly committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, as well as sustainable earnings and dividend growth.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob to cover some of our business unit initiatives and execution highlights.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Steve. Before opening the call to your questions, let me quickly hit on some key markers at each of our business units. Let's start with CPG on Slide 6.","Our CPG team continues to originate and execute on an expanding mix of projects. That includes new and ongoing customer-driven growth projects, as well as our landmark modernization program. From a system modernization standpoint, as I noted earlier, we began recovering our 2013 investments in February. This year's program also is on track, with about $300 million in investments planned. As you know, our customers have agreed to the initial 5 years of the program, with an opportunity to mutually extend the agreement. Overall, we've identified a total modernization investment opportunity of more than $4 billion. Meanwhile, CPG's midstream team is continuing to capitalize on our strategic position in the Marcellus and Utica regions.","Recently, the team announced a new project supported by a binding agreement with Range Resources to build additional gathering pipelines and compression facilities in Washington County, Pennsylvania. That project, an investment of about $120 million, will transport wellhead production to a nearby Columbia Transmission pipeline. NiSource Midstream's natural gas liquids pipeline, currently under construction as part of our Pennant Midstream venture, remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter of this year. The line will ultimately deliver up to 90,000 barrels of liquids per day.","Meanwhile, our joint resource development arrangement in the Utica Shale is accelerating. 25 wells are now in various stages of drilling, and another 10 wells are currently in production. We now anticipate that more than 30 wells will be completed this year, with the production dedicated to the Pennant Midstream gathering and processing facilities.","In addition to our midstream progress, our CPG team is advancing an array of supply- and market-driven growth projects. In fact, our CPG project, set to begin service this year, will add almost 1 billion cubic feet of capacity to our system. That includes our Warren County, West Side Expansion, Giles County and Line 1570 projects. Our East Side Expansion project remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter of 2015. The first quarter also saw significant progress on several new projects. We're in advanced discussions with customers following the positive open season for our Rayne and Leach XPress projects. Together, these projects will transport about 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, providing a major new pathway for connecting shale production with markets on Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf Systems and well beyond.","In a separate, recently completed open season, we're exploring strong consumer interest around our WB XPress project, which would involve the transportation of more than 1 billion cubic feet of Marcellus Shale production.","We'll keep you posted on the progress of each of these XPress projects as customer discussions mature. On these projects, I'd like to add a brief footnote. The Rayne and Leach XPress projects are maturing nicely, and we expect to be able to provide additional details before the end of the third quarter.","On the WB XPress project, that, too, is moving along nicely. However, it's a little earlier in the process. It could be closer to the end of the year when we'll have more tangible details to share.","As you can see, the CPG team is executing on an impressive array of initiatives and projects. We expect those efforts will result in a capital investment of more than $800 million for CPG this year.","Next, let's shift to our Indiana electric business summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO continues to advance a broad agenda of customer service, reliability and environmental improvements. Following the February approval of NIPSCO's $1.1 billion electric modernization program, NIPSCO began executing on the first year of its investments under the program. The 7-year program provides for the replacement and upgrade of underground circuits, transformers and poles, helping to increase system reliability and deliver economic development benefits to the region.","As you know, NIPSCO also filed a complementary 7-year -- $700 million natural gas modernization program. We expect the decision from the IURC as early as this afternoon.","Our significant environmental investments also remain on schedule and on budget. The 2 remaining FGD projects at NIPSCO's Schahfer and Michigan City electric generating facilities are slated for completion by year-end 2014 and year-end 2015, respectively.","These are part of more than $850 million in environmental investments recently completed and planned at NIPSCO's electric generating facilities. NIPSCO also is on track with 2 major electric transmission projects. Right-of-way acquisition is in progress for the company's new 100-mile, 345-kV line, and stakeholder outreach and route selection are in progress for a new 70-mile, 760-kV line.","These projects together constitute an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO, and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.","All told, NIPSCO has an inventory of more than $6 billion in long-term investments that will benefit customers and provide a platform for economic development across Northern Indiana.","During 2014, we expect capital investments in NIPSCO's electric business will total about $450 million.","Let's turn now to our Gas Distribution Operations discussed on Slide 8. Our Gas Distribution teams continue to steadily execute on their long-term $10 billion plus inventory of infrastructure replacement and enhancement programs. Following our record year of Gas Distribution investments, we're on track to invest approximately $815 million in 2014 on system modernization and capital improvements. And, as you know, we've paired those investments with complementary customer programs and regulatory initiatives.","On the regulatory front, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts received approval in March for its base rate case. The company's new rates support infrastructure modernization investments and add about $19 million in annual revenues.","Just last week, Columbia Gas of Ohio received approval of another year of the company's infrastructure replacement program rider, adding approximately $25 million annually. New rates go into effect today. And as I noted earlier, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania also has filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania Commission. A decision on the $54 million request, which would support continuation of CPA's ongoing infrastructure modernization program, is expected later this year.","As you can see, our Gas Distribution companies continued to steadily execute on our well-established agenda of long-term investment and system integrity, reliability and customer programs.","To wrap up, we're well within our 2014 non-GAAP guidance of $1.61 to $1.71 per share. I also want to reiterate that our team continues to execute against NiSource's robust infrastructure investment-driven business strategy, and we're doing so while staying true to our well-established core commitments. Those are: maintaining stable investment-grade credit ratings, preserving a strong financial liquidity position, growing the dividend each year by 3% to 5% and delivering earnings growth in the range of 5% to 7% annually.","As always, we'll communicate with you about these and all other matters of importance in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com.","Thank you for participating today, and for your ongoing interest in -- towards NiSource. Ian, let's now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Speakers, please stand by for your first question, which comes from the line of Charles Fishman at Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Bob, let me first make sure my memory is correct on this. A couple of years ago, you talked about annual EPS growth of 5% to 7%. So that's getting a little dated. Is that still the current guidance you're giving on long-term EPS growth?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, it still is the current guidance. As you know, we've aggressively stepped up our capital program over the past couple of years. And as we grow into that program and as we require financing, we still believe that the 5% to 7% growth rate range is appropriate.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, I guess, my follow-up was if my memory was correct, which it sounds like it is and I realize that's old, I mean, you've had some very good regulatory outcomes. You've stepped up your capital spending as a result of that. When might you look to revisit that as far as maybe bumping the bottom end of that or bumping the whole range up a little?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, as I suggested, we're growing quite rapidly. We need to grow into our programs. We need to grow into capital spend. We need to deal with our financing as we tend to hit a more stable run rate, if you will, then we think it would be appropriate to take another look at the range. In the meantime, we still believe that's the best guidance we can give the market.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then if you make a decision, I think you indicated later this year maybe even third quarter you'll make a decision on MLP versus equity for next year. Would that be a trigger point for maybe revisiting the EPS growth rate?","Robert C. Skaggs","Could be. I don't want to suggest that it will be, but certainly it could be. And your recollection on a decision in and around the MLP, that's correct, it would be the third quarter of this year. And I would add that our team is considering an Investor Day in or around that third quarter period. So stay tuned.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one is from Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Rayne, Leach and WB XPress, are these -- these are wholly-owned by Columbia Pipeline Group, is that correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","These are our project pay dates as they say.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, I missed that.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, these are proposed and supported solely by the Columbia Pipeline Group.","Operator","And we have another question for you, this one is from Carl Kirst at BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I don't want to put the cart in front of the horse but...","Robert C. Skaggs","You're going to do it anyhow.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I don't want to do it but that's our job, right? With WB XPress, I mean, it looks like, effectively, we're going to be broadening, if I have my PAPs correctly, Leach as well, sending even more gas west towards the Columbia Gulf. And I guess as I look at Rayne and Leach and one being 1.5 Bcf a day, but the Columbia Gulf portion only being 800 million, and then maybe we have WB a year behind it but sending even more gas towards Columbia Gulf. I guess, what I'm asking is would it be also likely that we see a follow-on Columbia Gulf expansion potentially in the mix as well? And understanding that there are a lot of pipelines out there trying to do the same: ANR, NGPL, et cetera. Just trying to figure out if there's even more sort of baking than what we're seeing?","Robert C. Skaggs","There's a lot there, Carl. Let me just begin with this. If Rayne, Leach XPress came to fruition, if WB XPress came to fruition and, as you recall, we're working on this West Side project as we speak, the entirety of Columbia Gulf would be rendered bidirectional. Now if additional -- there was additional demand, it was economic for us to construct and expand even more going South, something we would certainly consider, right? The line of sight today is West Side, Rayne, Leach XPress and WB, and rendering Columbia Gulf bidirectional. That's line of sight as we sit here today.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Great. So I think -- okay, that's very helpful. So basically, Columbia Gulf could also, in sort of this bidirectional capacity, would also have the ability to take a WB XPress? That wouldn't necessarily be a...?","Robert C. Skaggs","Oh, yes.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay, okay. Maybe just 2 other very, very small ones, if I could. One, I didn't know if it was a material amount, if you could break it out, but it was mentioned as far as what the royalties were for CPG in the first quarter? And then second on the -- basically, the Hilcorp drilling, I guess there was a little bit of -- Ohio came out and this concern over some of the earthquakes and East Ohio drilling, and I did not know if any of that impacted what Hilcorp was doing. It sounds like from the wells, and the number of wells you underscored, that it was not? But I just wanted to make sure I was clear on it.","Stephen P. Smith","Carl, this is Steve. I'll take the first question and I'll let Bob answer the Hilcorp question. The mineral rights royalty revenue for the first quarter was $7 million.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay, excellent.","Robert C. Skaggs","And Carl, with regard to Hilcorp, Ohio regulatory activities in and around fracking, first of all, we believe Ohio's response, stable house [ph] response to concerns was constructive, measured, reasonable. And we don't see it materially impacting Hilcorp's drilling program in Ohio. Having said that, Hilcorp is concentrating most of their activity -- current activity in Pennsylvania.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay.","Robert C. Skaggs","Let me just maybe add a little bit more clarification around WB. Going west, one key point of intersection for the WB expansion is at Broad Run, or what we call Broad Run, and that's an intersection or delivery point into Tennessee. So that's a path that's included within the scope of WB. If we put additional gas to our Leach point, that is the northern end of Columbia Gulf, we would have additional opportunities to send Gulf gas out, additional opportunities to invest. Does that help, Carl?","Operator","We have another question for you. This one is from John Edwards at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just following on Carl's question and your discussion. I mean, with the possibility of making Columbia bidirectional, I mean, just -- is there any kind of ballpark capital that we could be thinking about in terms of what that might cost?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. I'd ask you to bear with us on both Rayne, Leach XPress and WB XPress on capital, shippers, and the like. I would, though, suggest that if you look at the open seasons on Rayne, Leach XPress', on WB XPress', you'll see significant volumes, significant quantities involved in both projects. You'll also see the advertised rates for those projects. And I think as you look at that information and as you think about modeling, you can develop some scenarios that I think would be reasonable in and around CapEx.","John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. Fair enough. Okay. And then the earlier question with regard to the earnings growth, have you calculated or maybe you could tell us what you think -- what kind of capital investment you think it takes to edge up that earnings growth, say, another 1%?","Robert C. Skaggs","We really haven't looked at it that way, John. I mean you clearly can do the math on every $100 million of incremental CapEx and put a multiplier on that and impute some growth. But what I would emphasize that this company has grown so quickly and has launched so many initiatives, be it regulatory, legislative, commercial, replacement, whatever. We're still in the mode of digesting and growing into that very aggressive growth rate. And once we reach stability, we're going to be in a much better position to give you a very reliable, take it to the bank, sort of prospective growth rate. So that's the way we think about it, and we do think of it on a long-term basis. In the meantime, we're going to execute against the plan and we're going to deliver the numbers that we say we're going to deliver.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one is from Becca Followill from U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","My questions have been answered.","Robert C. Skaggs","Becca, kudos on the fond reports that you all published, I think it was yesterday or last week. really well done. Comprehensive, to say the least.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one is from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions, just cleanup from me. Very strong volumes at NIPSCO on both the industrial and wholesale side this quarter. Much stronger than we've seen in quite some time in a period. Obviously, weather had an impact, but curious if there was anything sort of specific outside of weather that was influencing industrial and wholesale volumes? And if that changed, at all, your outlook for the business for the remainder of the year?","Robert C. Skaggs","I'll answer the last first. It really doesn't change the fundamental outlook of the business, and frankly, it's a little bit of a non-intuitive outcome of weather that drove the numbers. Many of our large industrial customers have self generating capabilities. Because of the severe weather, because of maintenance requirements, because of whatever, they were unable to generate as much power as they typically do. So they fell back. They relied on NIPSCO to supply that power. So that drove a big part of the number. We also had opportunistic opportunities to sell power off-system during the quarter, again, weather-related. So on a run-rate basis, we don't see either one of those as recurring. Episodically, we'll have those opportunities, but hard to see them through the balance of the year.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then maybe a question for Steve. On Columbia Pipeline, the asset sale. Noticed you had some last year, I think most of that was tied to sale of the storage base gas. So I'm just curious what the sale was in 1Q? And if you have sort of any degree of expectation for what might be in the hopper for the rest of the year at the Pipeline Group on that front?","Stephen P. Smith","Sure. The $17.5 million is associated with the modernization of leases that were incorporated into the Pennant joint venture. There are about 3,000-or-so leases that were modernized to allow for horizontal drilling today. And once those leases were modernized, we took the income associated with them in the first quarter. If you look out the balance of 2014, there's probably another $3 million or so of that modernized lease revenue that we will be receiving as a result of that activity.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Another question from Carl Kirst at BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Sorry, just a quick follow-up mainly because of the strength of first quarter results, obviously, a big delta year-over-year and understanding we're still very early in the year and so, perhaps, there is some reluctance, for instance, to move up the guidance curve at this point. But simply, with what we've seen in the first quarter, it would almost imply that the expectation for the next 9 months, for instance, is basically just flat with last year. And so I guess my question is, is there any -- is this just sort of out of an abundance of caution earlier in the year? Are there, perhaps, some timing issues that maybe shifted some earnings into the first quarter? That this is more sort of a timing or shape of the quarter curve, if you will, for the full year? I just want to make sure we've got the right read of it.","Robert C. Skaggs","To your point, a very strong quarter positions us well for the year, but as you also observed, there's 9 months to go and a lot of blocking and tackling left. So at this point, we want to take it one quarter by one quarter, and if we feel like there's a reason to move it up, we will do so. But right now, we're still within the range.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Understood. Just wanted to touch base.","Robert C. Skaggs","Carl, while I have you, one other thing I'd add about WB, and I know there's a lot of interest about both of the XPress' project. Just to be clear on the WB XPress project, while I suggested it takes gas west, which it does, it also is designed to take gas east. So just wanted to make sure you're aware of that.","Operator","Thank you very much. There's no further questions. So I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs for closing remarks.","Robert C.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Randy Hulen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Randy Hulen","Thank you and good morning everyone. On behalf of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Partners, I would like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, Chief Executive Officer and Steve Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, the primary focus of today's call is to review NiSource's financial performance for the full year and fourth quarter of 2014 as well as provide an overall business update. Following our NiSource prepared remarks, we will also share a brief overview of the predecessor results for Columbia Pipeline Partners which were released this morning. We will then open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we will refer to the supplemental slides available on our website.","I would like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings. With all those items out of the way, the call is now yours, Bob.","Bob Skaggs","Thanks, Randy. Good morning and thank you for joining us. 2014 was a watershed year for NiSource. It was anchored by focused execution of a record infrastructure investment program and the initiation of strategic and transformational growth plans. Those notably included the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners and the announcement of the Columbia Pipeline Group spinoff. If you will turn to slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you will see a few of the year's highlights. The NiSource team delivered yet another year of solid operational performance and industry-leading financial results.","In 2014, we generated net operating earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP of $1.72 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.71 per share and up nearly 9% from 2013 and we delivered total returns to our shareholders of 32%, which outperformed the major utility indices for the sixth consecutive year.","Our team executed on a record $2.2 billion capital investment program, made significant progress on various regulatory and legislative programs and originated several transformational growth projects at CPG. These initiatives synched closely with our company-wide modernization initiatives, delivered significant value to our customers by facilitating the development of significant shale resources and providing more modern, safe, efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure. They also benefit our communities through job creation and economic development and our shareholders through sustainable long-term returns.","During the year, we also expanded our projected long-term inventory of infrastructure investments which is now targeted at $12 billion to $15 billion at CPG over the next 10 years and $30 billion at NiSource's utilities over 20 plus years. As I noted at the top of the call, 2014 marked the launch of two important strategic initiatives; the separation of CPG and the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners.","On that note, our team was pleased with Columbia Pipeline Partners' $1.2 billion initial public offering in early February. The Partnership's offering was enthusiastically received by investors. Steve will provide a brief update on the partnership as part of this morning's call. We remain on track with the NiSource CPG separation process. A couple of weeks ago, we filed our initial form 10 registration statement with the SEC, have announced key expected board members and the majority of executive team members for both companies.","Following the separation, both companies are expected to move forward as independent, investment grade pure play entities with experienced teams focusing on executing and elevating well-established platforms for growth. As we look ahead to NiSource and CPG operating, independent companies, I wanted to briefly highlight their growth expectations. As we first announced in our 2014 investor day, NiSource as a pure play utility expects its average annual long-term earnings and dividend to grow at 4% to 6% over the long term.","As a pure play pipeline company with an MLP, CPG is targeting its annual adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid- to upper teens over the next several years. Its annual dividend growth is expected to be commensurate with this robust EBITDA growth. With these very strong growth rates and deep investment inventories, both companies will be positioned in the top tier of their peer groups. As the separation date gets closer, both NiSource and CPG will conduct roadshows to provide additional details on their projected performance profiles.","And just to expand on the growth for one moment, we wanted to be absolutely clear on the fundamental baseline commitments of each company. Therefore, we provided earnings and dividend outlooks as well as capital expenditure outlooks. We wanted to be clear on what long-term drivers are for each of the businesses. We wanted to be helpful versus academic.","And as you know, 2015 will be a split year for NiSource and CPG with significant developments unfolding during the first half of the year, including the IPO of CPPL, the recapitalization of CPG and NiSource, as well as the separation itself and the ongoing development of Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress. Again, we wanted to provide what was helpful, what was most constructive, therefore our key commitments are key fundamental drivers.","As we mentioned, roadshows will occur prior to separation to provide additional detail on 2015, 2016 and the long term. Now with that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our 2014 financial results highlighted on page 4 of our supplemental slides.","Steve Smith","Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we've exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $125 million. By GAAP comparison, our income to continuing operations was about $530 million for 2014 versus about $490 million for 2013.","At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our three core business units delivered solid financial results. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $491 million compared to about $441 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues excluding the impact of trackers were up about $80 million.","NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $288 million in operating earnings compared to about $265 million for the prior year. Net revenues excluding trackers were up about $47 million. And finally, our Gas Distribution business unit came in at about $517 million, compared to about $449 million in 2013. Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $126 million.","As our numbers attest, it was another strong year for the NiSource team. Full details of our results are available on our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.","Now turning to slide 5, I would like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity positions. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $720 million of net available liquidity at the end of the year. Of our record $2.2 billion capital investment program, approximately 76% of these investments were focused on revenue-generating opportunities.","Our debt to capitalization came in at about 62% of the end of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource CPG separation. In that regard, we have taken several key steps to establish a strong financial foundation for both companies. The first step was to secure two separate credit facilities that will become effective at the separation. We entered into two $1.5 billion five-year credit facilities, one for NiSource and the other for CPG. These facilities will replace NiSource's existing $2 billion agreement.","At the same time we entered these agreements, we also entered into a $500 million five-year facility at Columbia Pipeline Partners which went into effect at the time of the IPO. The next major step in this process is the recapitalization, which is on schedule to commence in the second quarter. We will provide additional updates on this process in our first quarter earnings update and through other public announcements.","With that, I will turn the call back to Bob to discuss a few execution highlights from each of our business units.","Bob Skaggs","Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next 10 years, with most major projects currently in execution or in advanced stages of development.","During 2014, CPG placed more than $300 million in system expansion projects and service, adding approximately $1.1 billion cubic feet of system capacity. An additional $200 million in midstream projects were put in service during the year and CPG's modernization work approached $320 million.","So in total for 2014, we added more than $800 million in new revenue-generating assets in service all on time and on budget. Meanwhile, the CPG team is in full execution mode on several ongoing and transformational growth projects.","In December, the FERC approved the construction of the East Side expansion project which will provide approximately 315 million cubic feet per day of additional capacity for Marcellus supplies to reach growing mid-Atlantic markets. This $275 million project is expected to be placed in service later this year.","In addition to the East Side expansion, CPG has more than $3 billion of growth projects in progress that will add approximately 4 billion cubic feet of transportation capacity. These projects include the Leach and Rayne XPress projects, the WB XPress project and the Cameron Access project. The Rayne and Leach projects collectively involve about $1.8 billion in system expansion, creating a major new pathway for transporting shale production to attractive markets and liquid trading points. Both projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2017.","WB XPress is almost a $900 million project to transport about 1.3 billion cubic feet of shale gas to East Coast markets and various pipeline interconnects including access to the go point LNG terminal and Cameron Access is a roughly $300 million investment that involves new pipeline facilities to connect with the Cameron LNG terminal in southern Louisiana. The project will offer initial capacity of up to 800 million cubic feet per day.","Our Columbia midstream team also is continuing to capitalize on CPG's strong asset position in the Marcellus and Utica regions. Midstream projects currently in progress include $120 million Washington County gathering project and the $65 million Big Pine expansion project. Big Pine in the first phase of Washington County will be placed in service before the end of the year.","As you may recall during our prior discussions, we've outlined plans for the potential Mountaineer XPress project. We're now in advance commercial discussions with customers on this major project, as well as a complementary project called Gulf XPress. If implemented, these projects would provide substantial transportation capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. These two projects could involve an investment as large as $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We hope to complete commercial terms and clear all contractual outs by July.","As you can see, on all fronts, the CPG team is executing against an impressive and indeed transformational growth agenda. In 2015, we're targeting a capital investment level of approximately $1.1 billion of CPG. As you've heard us say before, our intent is to triple our net asset base over the next five years.","With that, let's now shift to our utility businesses starting with NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business summarized on slide 7. NIPSCO is continuing to deliver on its commercial and customer strategy with an inventory of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20 plus years.","2014 was a strong year for NIPSCO as well. In the first half of 2014, NIPSCO commenced its seven-year natural gas and electric infrastructure modernization programs now expected to reach an investment level of nearly $2 billion and completed approximately $120 million of projects in 2014. These investments will help improve reliability, maintain system safety for the next generation.","On the environmental front, in December NIPSCO placed the final FGD new unit in service at Schahfer Generating Facility. This unit, like the one placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2013 was delivered on time and on budget. A third FGD unit at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generation Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City units, all of NIPSCO's coal burning facilities will be fully scrubbed.","On the growth side, progress also continued on two major NIPSCO electric transmission projects. Right of away, acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects and preliminary construction will begin on the 345 kV Reynolds to Topeka line in the first half of this year. If you recall, these projects involve an investment of about $0.5 billion for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.","Finally, in addition to the continuation of NIPSCO's electric energy efficiency programs, the IURC approved the extension of the green power rate program. NIPSCO also reached a settlement on the continuation of its feed-in tariff program.","NIPSCO's agenda in 2015 remains focused on enhancing the reliability and environmental performance of the systems through modernization and replacement investments. In addition to delivering customer programs that help reduce energy usage and manage bills, these investments expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015 deliver significant economic development and job creation activity in northern Indiana, while at the same time delivering value to our investors.","Turning to our Gas Distribution Operations on slide 8, you can see a similar story of large-scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary regulatory and customer initiatives. ","Touching on a few highlights from the year, in November, the Pennsylvania Commission approved the settlement in Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case. The case provides for recovery of CPA's investments in its well-established infrastructure modernization program and will increase annual revenues by approximately $33 million. New rates went into effect in December.","Also in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia reached a settlement with customers for its rate case, which if approved would increase base rates by about $25 million. Notably in January, the hearing examiner in the case recommended approval of the settlement. Final commission decision is expected by the end of the first quarter. These rate cases, along with one completed in Massachusetts, provide for continued recovery of investments related to our well-established infrastructure programs which are designed to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our systems.","Also in the fourth quarter, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed its 2015 system, gas system enhancement plan under new legislation authorizing accelerated recovery of gas infrastructure modernization investments. If approved as filed, cost recovery would increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million.","Across the gas utilities, we expect to invest almost $900 million in 2015. Together, NiSource's industry-leading platform for utility growth provides significant reliability, safety and environmental benefits to our existing and new customers while also delivering shareholder returns through transparent recovery mechanisms.","Shifting to slide 9, our key takeaways for 2015, we plan to execute our current business and customer plans while at the same time delivering the CPG spinoff on schedule in mid-2015. We're moving ahead with another year of record capital investments, targeted at $2.4 billion across our utilities and pipelines and a complementary regulatory and customer service agenda.","As for the separation, we're well on our way to standing up two premier companies, with an experienced slate of management and directors at both companies. CPG and NiSource will be well-financed and strongly positioned to execute on their distinct strategies and deliver enhanced long-term earnings and dividend growth. As I mentioned, both NiSource and CPG will conduct roadshows prior to separation to provide detailed business profiles.","With those highlights for NiSource, we will now shift to slide 11 in the NiSource deck and Steve will discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners IPO and its predecessor results. Steve?","Steve Smith","Thanks, Bob. With the launch of CPPL, we've introduced a best in class MLP to the market. One with a strong supportive sponsor, stable and predictable cash flows that are virtually insensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes, a robust growth profile with a deep inventory of long-term infrastructure investments.","The strategic footprint overlaying the Marcellus and Utica shale production areas. The financial strength and flexibility and a premier execution focused and experienced leadership team. Our offering was very well received and we're very pleased with the continued positive response.","Let's quickly touch on our IPO and predecessor results on page 12. The offering of approximately 54 million units at $23 per share raised nearly $1.2 billion. The pricing offering on February 5 and subsequently began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPPL the following day. These units include the full [inaudible] allotment executed by the underwriters. And as I mentioned previously, our $500 million five-year revolving credit facility we entered into in December came effective upon the IPO.","Now let's turn to our predecessor results issued this morning for periods prior to the IPO. As we outlined during our earlier NiSource remarks, Columbia Pipeline Group executed on and placed into service a wide variety of high-value projects during the year. These projects recorded CPPL's predecessor growth and will serve as the model for the partnerships growth in 2015 and beyond.","The predecessor reported net income of about $269 million for 2014 compared to about $267 million for 2013. The increase is primarily a result of new growth projects placed in service, new firm contracts and higher mineral rights royalties.","On an adjusted EBITDA basis, the predecessor reported about $599 million in 2014 versus about $543 million in 2013. These results provide us with a solid footing as we move forward with CPPL's strategy. Bob?","Bob Skaggs","Thanks Steve and thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Partners. With that Nicholas, we're ready to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Barta with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","John Barta","Bob, thanks for the color on the Columbia kind of growth rates there. First off, are there any certain milestones we should be looking for regarding Mountaineer and Golf pipeline or did you say everything was going to be finalized in July?","Bob Skaggs","Yes, we mentioned we hope to clear all of our contractual outs by July. At the moment, we're still working on agreements with the foundation shippers. One event that we would point you to is open seasons, both Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress. If you see those in the coming weeks, or so, that would be a positive sign that the projects continue to be moving forward. I would add those open seasons will be binding open seasons. That would be one guidepost.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Carl Kirst","If I could just maybe stay with Mountaineer and Gulf XPress for a second but perhaps ask it in a way to see if there has been any shift in tone in producer conversations and in particular, if you've seen any reticence or pulling back midstream versus pipeline? Certainly your enthusiasm for the pipelines to hopefully have contracts by July would indicate that they are staying pretty positive and constructive. But I just wanted to make sure I'm getting the right read here.","Bob Skaggs","Yes. You've hit the nail on the head. It remains positive, constructive. We have been in very, very close contact with our producer shipper customers both on the big work projects as well as the midstream projects.","Carl Kirst","Do you find a difference in the tenor of conversations between the midstream and the pipelines, or just given the exposure to the region, both are continuing to move forward?","Bob Skaggs","It's the latter. There is not a material difference in tone. As you know, folks are being prudent with their CapEx for 2015. Having said that, they still remain fully committed to the Marcellus and Utica and they still focus on take away capacity particularly when you get into the 2017, 2018, 2019 timeframe.","Carl Kirst","And then maybe one last question on the larger pipes and recognizing hopefully we have a binding open season not too far away. I guess should we think about the risk to the project? Is this more of a -- do you guys feel like you are in a competitive shootout with anybody, or is this just a matter of getting the producers comfortable with the economics and trying to get to the right region, but once they make that decision, you guys or these projects are the obvious choice? I just want to make sure I got a good sense of that.","Bob Skaggs","I wouldn't go so far as to say obvious choice, but I would say that the focus tends to be on your latter point. That being the economics, the in service date and the like.","Carl Kirst","And then last question if I could and then maybe one for Steve. I know of very tiny thing, but I'm just curious given the difference of commodity prices, is there any way we should think about the delta or the change in mineral or royalties that you guys are getting from the upstream exposure between 2015 and 2014?","Steve Smith","This is Steve. I would say it's immaterial to the overall results going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Sighinolfi","I just wanted to follow-up on of couple things. I appreciate your color and comments on the CPG ex EBITDA and dividend growth profiles. I was just curious assuming that you're not going to answer a question as to where the starting point is for 2015, if you could just help us frame as you think about it and the board thinks about it the policy considerations around the initial level. I get the growth rate, but as we think about where -- the variables that might shape where you guys ultimately set the starting point upon which we're going to grow at that mid to upper teens level. Can you just give us some additional color on that front?","Bob Skaggs","Yes. Two key considerations. Number one, as you know we're very sensitive to credit. We're fully committed to investment grade credit. We need to go through the credit rating process in the March timeframe as we prepare for recap. So that starting point quite frankly is somewhat sensitive, somewhat dependent on credit considerations.","The other is that the huge CapEx needs we have and so it's balancing credit, CapEx and financing coming out of the gate. Those are the key considerations for starting point.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And so to dovetail on prior questions, if some of the projects that are currently in discussion, sounds like they are moving forward into execution, like Mountaineer and Gulf that could be significant capital deployment. I would imagine then that would be part of this conversation.","Bob Skaggs","Correct. As I pointed out in my prepared remarks that we do have the significant events as we come up to separation and that's certainly a huge, huge variable as we look at the financials and the outlook for the business.","Chris Sighinolfi","Perfect. And I guess switching and perhaps this is a question for Steve. Given the IPO, I know priced 15% or so above the range and I'm imagining the full overallotment exercise. Does that change at all the amount you had talked previously about a $3 billion debt recap. Does that shape at all the expectations around that modestly or at all?","Steve Smith","Not to a large extent. I mean, it does help obviously from a credit perspective, so we're very pleased with the outcome of the IPO. With respect to the recapitalization, it is not going to move the needle too dramatically either way.","Bob Skaggs","We suggest still thinking in terms of $3 billion.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And that I imagine will be profiled out in various tranches the various duration. Am I incorrect in thinking that?","Steve Smith","That is correct. Our current debt portfolio has a weighted average life of approximately 13.5 years. We would shoot for something north of 10 years, weighted average life. So probably issue a basket of 5, 10 and 30s to achieve that.","Chris Sighinolfi","One final question for me, there was a slight uptick even if I exclude the transaction costs for the fourth quarter that you reported in your corporate segment. There was an uptick in the corporate line item. Is there anything specific that's driving that or is that just a variance from year-to-year?","Bob Skaggs","That's just a variance from year-to-year. We have a bit more outside services costs in there as well as a result of all the activities we have going on here currently with respect to the separations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Becca Followill","The growth rate that you've outlined for CPG of mid- to upper-teens, over what time frame is that?","Bob Skaggs","Next three to five years.","Becca Followill","And are you willing to talk at this point about what type of payout ratio that assumes?","Bob Skaggs","Not at this point, Becca.","Becca Followill","Okay. I understand. And then the large CapEx program that you have at CPG, how do you finance that going forward?","Bob Skaggs","Well, the MLP is the sole source of equity through the period and we will be using it frequently to support that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","I assume you will take a couple questions on NIPSCO. Slide 7, Bob, the $67 million of the electric modernization plan to be expected to be spent in 2015. 100% of that is covered by trackers?","Bob Skaggs","That's correct.","Charles Fishman","And then I would assume if my math's correct $1.1 billion over seven years, that's probably likely going to accelerate that number in 2016 or is this thing backend loaded?","Bob Skaggs","It gradually steps up and you may have heard us say in prior calls, prior discussions, as we complete the scrubber program, the modernization program begins to tick up or step up.","Charles Fishman","Okay. And then last question on NIPSCO, the clean power plan, if you look at what the EPA is proposing for Indiana, a lot of coal plant heat rate improvement, a lot of renewables, a lot of efficiencies at the customer level. Not a lot of gas CCDTs, but have you had any initial discussions with Indiana about what, what would be expected of NIPSCO if this thing comes in even close to what they are proposing?","Bob Skaggs","Yes. We're in constant communications with our stakeholders, with the state. At this point nothing definitive has really been exchanged or decided. But clearly we're working day to day with all those folks.","Charles Fishman","Now in the CPP plan for Indiana, a lot of renewables, is that something that's even on the radar screen as far as the electric utility or the NIPSCO that's after the separation that that's an investment opportunity that they might consider?","Bob Skaggs","Yes, it could be down the road, but I would say over the next few years, still continues to play a modest role in the portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. And with no further questions in the queue, I will now like to turn the call over to the speakers for any closing remarks.","Bob Skaggs","Thank you and thank you once again for your ongoing interest in NiSource and your ongoing support. We greatly appreciate it. Have a good, safe day. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a good day, everyone."],"15554":["NiSource, Inc. (NYSE:NI) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February 22, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Randy G.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call will be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Randy Hulen, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Randy G. Hulen - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you, Catherine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer. The purpose of today's call is to review the NiSource financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2016, as well as provide an overall update on our utility operations and growth drivers. We'll then open the call up to your questions.","As a reminder, we will be referring to our supplemental slides during this call. These slides are available on our website. Also available on our website is a document that contains segment and financial information to accompany this presentation.","Before turning the call over to Joe, just a couple of reminders, some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","In addition, some of the statements made on this conference call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment and financial information available on NiSource.com. In that document, you'll also find our full financial schedules that have historically been available in our earnings release.","One final reminder, when comparing our full year 2016 results to 2015, keep in mind that we successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015, and those results for CPG are now classified as discontinued operations.","So, with all that out of the way, the call is yours, Joe.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 marks the first fiscal year for NiSource operating exclusively as a regulated utility company, and the financial and operational results that our team produced during the year demonstrate the enduring strengths of our long-term infrastructure investment strategy.","The customer-focused investments we're making are enhancing the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our systems, as well as customer service and employee training, all of which supported earnings and dividend growth for our investors.","Let's look at slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2016 and early 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $1.09, which compares to $0.94 in 2015, and is near the upper-end of our 2016 guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. We invested a record $1.5 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our seven states. The value these investments deliver included replacement of 406 miles of priority pipe, 12% more than in 2015, driving continued reductions in leaks, outages and emissions. In addition, we replaced 60 miles of underground cable and more than 1,200 electric poles, improving electric reliability for our Indiana customers.","We also completed significant regulatory initiatives supporting these investments across our footprint. These included gas base rate case settlement approvals in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania, and just last month reaching a settlement agreement in Virginia, as well as approvals of settlements in a long-term electric modernization program and electric base rate case in Indiana, and finally, infrastructure tracker updates in several states.","We're committed to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through these continued gas modernization investments and planned coal-fired plant retirements as we diversify our electric generation portfolio. In fact, in early 2016, we became a charter member of the U.S. EPA's Methane Challenge Program, committing to reduce our methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet over five years.","We also added about 33,000 new customers in 2016, our best year for customer growth in a decade. The growth was driven by a number of factors, including an increase in gas conversions from other fuels, recovery in the new housing market, and low customer attrition.","With our continuing track record of producing strong results and the confidence that we have the right business plan and the right team in place, we are reaffirming our net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 per share to $1.18 per share for 2017. In addition, we now expect to invest about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our infrastructure this year, up from our prior estimate of $1.5 billion. The increase is driven primarily by investments on the electric side related to increasing service reliability and repositioning our generation fleet. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments we first outlined in 2014.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 4, as Joe mentioned earlier, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016 compared with about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $894 million for the year, which is an increase of about $62 million over the same year in 2015.","On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $858 million for 2016 versus about $800 million in 2015. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure investments.","Now, let's take a closer look at our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016, an increase of about $30 million from 2015, and our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $302 million in 2016, an increase of about $23 million from 2015. These increases were driven primarily by higher net revenues from returns earned on our infrastructure investments across our seven states.","And as Joe mentioned, our net operating earnings for the year came in near the upper end of our guidance range, and our solid overall results demonstrate the strength of our investment-driven plan. For full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at NiSource.com.","Now, turning to slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.9% at the end of 2015. At the end of the year, we maintained net available liquidity of about $684 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility.","I'll note that we increased our credit facility by $350 million to $1.85 billion during the fourth quarter to provide additional liquidity and support for our capital investment program. It's also worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the three major agencies are investment-grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+; Moody's at Baa2; and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook.","Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised (09:50) for continued growth. But before turning the call back to Joe, I'd like to briefly address federal tax reform, which we know is a topic that many of you are tracking closely. As with any potential legislation that could affect our customers and shareholders, NiSource is actively monitoring the discussion and working with our industry partners at AGA and EEI as well as elected officials help shape a balanced and constructive outcome.","Our objectives in this policy efforts are to retain interest deductibility, ensure fair and effective transition rules, while also balancing the interest of our customers and our shareholders. I'd also say, it's way too early to comment specifically on tax reform. However, I would note that as a 100% regulated company, most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and has minimal to no impact on regulated earnings.","Sorry, I think we're having a fire drill here. We're going to check on that. I'll continue until we get noticed. So, where was it, say, it's too early \u2013 we are a 100% regulated company, and so, most tax changes would be reflected in customer rates and has minimal to no impact on regulated earnings and only a modest potential impact on cash flow.","The primary exposure NiSource has under some current proposals is related to a portion of our corporate level debt, not capitalized and regulated operating companies, or our current investment programs. Therefore, eliminating the deductibility of interest and\/or reducing the corporate tax rate below the current 35% would have a modest dilutive impact on consolidated earnings.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment, and regulatory highlights.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Donald. We've continued to execute on our well-established, customer-focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, we're focused on delivering our results the right way with our customers, communities, employees, and investors in mind.","In 2016, we received several recognitions for doing just that. For instance, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the third straight year. The Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the World's Most Ethical Companies for the fifth year in a row. And we were named by Forbes Magazine as one of America's Best Large Employer, an honor based on independent surveys of employees at the nation's largest organizations.","We're also continuing to provide programs and services that can help our customers reduce energy usage and manage their bills. For instance, in December, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a plan by Columbia Gas of Ohio to continue offering its energy efficiency programs for another six years. We expect that approximately 700,000 customers will benefit from these programs during that period, helping them save money by reducing their gas, electric, and water usage.","Since the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015, NiSource has produced a total shareholder return of nearly 41%, outperforming the Dow Jones Utility Index, and in November we were ranked number one for total shareholder return among mid-cap electric companies over a five-year period by the Edison Electric Institute.","Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter from our Gas Operations on slide 6. New rates became effective December 19 at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania following Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval in October of a joint settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the continued upgrade and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The new rates increase annual revenue by $35 million and the settlement includes incentives to expand gas service to commercial customers.","In Virginia, we reached the settlement in January with all parties to our base rate case pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The settlement, if approved, as filed would allow for about a $29 million annual revenue increase. We filed the rate request in April 2016, seeking to adjust base rates to recover investments that improve the overall safety and reliability of the distribution system. The case also supports the growth of our Virginia system, driven by increased customer demand for service. Updated interim base rates subject to refund were implemented in September. On February 8, the hearing examiner recommended approval of the settlement without modification and a Commission's decision is expected in the first half of 2017.","In Kentucky, we implemented new base rates on December 27, following Kentucky Public Service Commission modification and approval of our base rate case settlement agreement. The approval includes an annual revenue increase of about $13 million and will allow for continued system modernization and pipeline safety investments.","In Maryland, we implemented new base rates on October 27, following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approval increases annual revenue by about $4 million and supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and increased pipeline safety investment.","In Massachusetts, we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. The settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emissions, while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably.","[Technical Difficulty] (16:56-24:53)","Randy G. Hulen - NiSource, Inc.","Hello, Catherine. This is Randy Hulen again. We are back in the building and ready to reconvene. So, we apologize for the inconvenience to everyone, but we appreciate your patience. So, as soon as Joe grabs the seat, we'll restart where he left off. Thanks.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Randy, and thanks, Catherine. And again, our apologies for that. Although I will say as we keep safety as our top priority in all that we do important that we respond to these kind of incidents appropriately, so thanks for your patience and we'll pick up right where we left off. I was updating on our gas business segment and regulatory activity had gone through a number of the states, I will resume with the Massachusetts story where we implemented revised rates under our 2015 base rate case settlement. That settlement provided for about a $4 million incremental annual revenue increase effective November 1, 2016, which was in addition to the approximately $33 million increase that took effect on November 1, 2015. The settlement supports our continued efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure and reduce emission while positioning our Massachusetts operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably.","In Indiana, we continued to execute on our seven-year $824 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. On December 28, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved our semi-annual tracker update covering about $67 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2016 under this program.","Several other NiSource utilities also filed annual tracker updates related to their gas infrastructure modernization programs. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement Program, Columbia Gas of Virginia under Virginia's SAVE Act Program, and Columbia Gas of Maryland under its Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Program. Combined, these filings provide for recovery of about $125 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability.","The SAVE and STRIDE updates were approved in December. In Massachusetts, we expected a Department of Public Utilities order prior to May 1, 2017 when the update is scheduled to be implemented. As you can see across our gas utilities, we had a robust list of accomplishments on the regulatory, customer, and infrastructure fronts to wrap up 2016.","Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on slide 7. On November 1, NIPSCO submitted its Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC. It outlines NIPSCO's plans to meet its customers' anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan focused on providing customers affordable, clean energy while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes.","Under the plan, NIPSCO would retire 50% of its coal-fired generating fleets by the end of 2023, including Bailly Generating Station Units 7 and 8 and R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Units 17 and 18. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator has approved closure of Bailly Units 7 and 8 by mid-2018. Also, as outlined in the plan, on November 1, NIPSCO requested IURC approval to invest approximately $400 million in required environmental upgrades at its Michigan City Unit 12 and Schahfer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities.","New rates became effective October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement, which was approved by the IURC on July 18. The settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments and service improvements for customers and increases NIPSCO's annual revenues by about $73 million.","We're also focusing Indiana on executing our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution systems, designed to improve safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of investments to be made through 2022. We began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments this month.","And finally, our two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile, 345-kV and 65-mile, 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower construction are underway for both projects.","Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to remind everyone of our Investor Day scheduled for March 8 in New York City. That's in two weeks. The event will begin at 8 o'clock AM Eastern Time and I will be joined there by other members of NiSource's senior management team to discuss in detail the company's regulated utility infrastructure investment strategy. The event will be webcast live on NiSource.com.","As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways for the year and our long-term investment proposition. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to enhance value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.12 per share to $1.18 per share in 2017, with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend every year, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now, let's open the call to your questions. Catherine?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Joe Hamrock, CEO, for any closing remarks.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you, Catherine. I appreciate that. We'll take that not as a sign of no questions, but as an indication that we'll have a chance to talk in a couple of weeks and we do look forward to that. Thanks again for your interest in NiSource.","Once again, a reminder about our Investor Day on March 8 in New York City. It will be a great opportunity to do a deeper dive into our business and give you a chance to hear from some other members of our senior team. Thanks for your interest today, and have a great and safe day. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Hulen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Randy Hulen","Thank, Andrew and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer.","The purpose of today's call is to review NiSource's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, as well as provide an update on our business operations and growth drivers. We'll then open the call up to your questions. During this call, we will be referring to our supplemental slides; these slides are available on nisource.com.","Before turning the call over to Joe, just a quick reminder; some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","In addition, some of the statements made on this conference call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment and financial information which are also available on nisource.com. In that document, you'll also find our full financial schedules that have historically been available in our earnings release.","With all that out of the way, the call is now yours, Joe.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us.","2017 was the year of solid execution across all facets of our business plan with industry leading employee safety performance, improved customer satisfaction across all NiSource utilities, record infrastructure investments, increased customer growth, more recognition as the best place to work and sustained earnings per share and dividend growth for our investors.","Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight some of our significant achievements in 2017. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.21 compared to $1.09 in 2016. This was slightly above our guidance range for 2017. We invested a record $1.7 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2017, part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. This investment included replacing 377 miles of priority natural gas pipeline which drove continued reductions in leaks and methane emissions. We also replaced 68 miles of underground electric cable and about 1,300 electric poles improving electric service reliability for our customers in Indiana. We achieved industry top docile [ph] performance in our core employee safety metrics and I'm proud to say that 2017 was our safest year ever.","Customer satisfaction scores improved across all NiSource utilities. JD Power & Associates recognized Columbia Gas of Virginia as one of the nation's top gas only brands and NIPSCO as one of the most improved electric brands, and we added nearly 28,000 new customers which growth driven by increased conversions to gas from other fuels in a healthy housing market. We successfully completed key regulatory initiatives with approvals of gas base rate case settlements in Maryland and Virginia and our power generation environmental investment plan in Indiana. We refinanced nearly $1 billion in long-term debt at more favorable rates which will result in significant interest expense savings over the next several years. We established aggressive environmental targets supported by our business strategy including a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2025.","We earned global recognition as the 'Best Place to Work' as well as for our inclusive and diverse culture. NiSource was the top ranked utility in Forbes Magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017, and for the first time was recognized as the Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. And in early 2018, we were one of 104 companies in the world named to the inaugural Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. And we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 19% for 2017, significantly exceeding the two major utility indices.","As you can see, NiSource's performance in 2017 created value for our customers, the communities we serve, our employees and our investors, and we're well positioned for continued growth. Before turning the call over to Donald, I'd like to note how pleased I am with the targeted solution for the regulated utility industry that Congress included in Federal Tax Reform. Because this solution supports the continued investment in critical utility infrastructure that provides long-term benefits for our customers and communities. We're working with our key stakeholders and regulators in all 7 states to shape the most balanced and constructive approach to pass the benefits of tax reform back to our customers. This effort should play out over the next 6 months or so.","To highlight a few examples of this effort; in Indiana, we amended the NIPSCO gas rate case to reflect the impact of tax reform lowering the requested increase by approximately $26 million. In Ohio, we expect to include customer benefits from tax reform as part of our discussions around the capital expenditure program filing that requests the writer to recover deferred capital investments made since 2011 and which are not being recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker. As I said, these efforts as well as others across the remaining jurisdictions will take shape over the next six months or so. With this clarity about the new tax law and the expected regulatory implementation of its provisions, we're confident in our ability to meet our commitments to the financial community and continue to create solid shareholder value.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?","Donald Brown","Thanks Joe, and good morning everyone. I'd like to start by adding a few more details around tax reform which we know has been a great interest to investors over the past year.","Turning to Slide 4, with the adoption of the tax cuts and jobs act, we revalued our net operating loss carry forward to $508 million which is expected to continue to provide nice source of cash tax benefit beyond 2025. I would also point out that the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities increased our regulatory liabilities by approximately $1.5 billion which will provide a benefit to our customers. As Joe mentioned, the new tax law is positive for our customers since it lowers their costs and supports our continued investment in critical utility infrastructure which benefits all stakeholders by enhancing safety, service reliability and the environment performance of our system.","As we get more clarity on the regulatory implementation and work through business initiatives focused on efficiencies, we will better understand the impact of tax reform on our credit metrics, specifically funds from operations to debt. With this clarity, we will then finalize any necessary changes to our financing plan which may include utilizing a mix of hybrids, convertibles, debt and equity. I would add that any necessary changes will be within the context of delivering on our stated financial commitments, including every effort to maintain our current investment grade credit ratings. It puts confidence in our plan and the levers in flexibility that we have available to us to manage this near-term impact, and that we are reaffirming our 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32.","We also continue to expect to grow our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share and dividends by 5% to 7% each year through 2020 and to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs through 2020.","Moving on to our results in Slide 5; we've delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $398 million or $1.21 per share in 2017 compared with about $351 million or $1.09 per share in 2016. The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would note that our GAAP results were impacted by certain balance sheet adjustments and other items related to federal tax reform.","Let's now turn to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our gas distribution operations segment had operating earnings of about $587 million for the year compared with operating earnings of about $598 million in 2016. Net revenues were up about $164 million driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increased revenue was more than offset by operating expenses which increased by about $174 million. Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of $377 million for the year, an increase of about $75 million from 2016. Net revenues were up about $122 million driven by new rates from the 2016 base rate case and increased investment in the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by an approximately $48 million increase in operating expenses.","As we've discussed previously, the planned 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses were largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. We're managing these expenses closely and we're on-track for flat O&M expenses compared with 2017. Full details of our results included details of our fourth quarter performance earnings available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.","Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9 billion of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than at separation. This reduced cost to capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. At the end of 2017, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.","Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investments and regulatory highlights.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks for that update Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early 2018 from our gas operations on Slide 7.","Our gas base rate case in Indiana remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. In January, we made a supplemental filing which incorporates the customer benefits of federal tax reform lowering our annual revenue increase request by nearly $26 million if approved as filed. The case supports continued investments in systems upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increased pipeline safety and system reliability. An order is expected in the second half of this year.","In Ohio, the public utilities commissioned in January approved the five-year extension of Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure replacement program. This well-established program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. Also in Ohio, we filed an application in December for a capital expenditure program tracker which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 and not currently recovered in rates. Our application seeks to increase annual revenue by $29 million in 2018 and new rates under infrastructure modernization tracker program updates took effect last month in Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. Investments under these programs are designed to further improve system reliability and safety while efficiently recovering associated costs.","Now let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 8. The IURC in December approved our environmental settlement agreement covering approval and cost recovery for investments related to handling coal-ash residuals from certain units at our Michigan City and Schaefer generating stations. Construction work on these projects is underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2018. We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve systems safety and reliability. Approximately, $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022.","New rates took effect in November under our second semi-annual tracker update. The latest tracker update request was filed last month and covers approximately $75 million of investments made from May through November of 2017. And construction of our two major electric transmission projects is expected to be completed in mid-2018. The 100 mile 345 KV and 65 mile 765 KV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.","As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers, communities and shareholders and are sustainable for the long-term. For 2018 we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of a $1.26 to a $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on-track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now let's open the call to your questions. Andrew?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Paul Ridzon","Joe, since you took the helm, you've kind of laid out a pretty solid story of sustainable growth, protecting the balance sheet, predictability and that kind of -- recently we saw a headline that suggested you might be taking a different tact; can you comment on that?","Joseph Hamrock","I'm not sure what headline you're referring to Paul but [indiscernible] -- got you. So I won't speculate or comment on M&A activity or market rumors; I'll say that NiSource has always had a disciplined approach to growing shareholder value and the most recent example of that was last year when we elevated our CapEx program announced at Investor Day, that should result in an increased long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. And our current focus to grow shareholder value calls for continued execution of the $30 billion of long-term identified investments that as you know will benefit our customers and communities and underpins the sustainability of our plan, our focus remains there.","Paul Ridzon","And because NiSource is a little bit of a unique structure from the corporate structure standpoint, can you just give us a little bit more detail around how you've addressed tax reform issues and interest deductibility?","Joseph Hamrock","Sure. As I noted earlier, as I mentioned and Donald touched on this as well, we're very pleased that the new framework reflects the targeted solutions with so many of us advocated for -- across the industry throughout 2017, fundamentally because it benefits our customers and supports economic growth which underpins our business and it enhances the sustainability of our infrastructure modernization strategy by reducing one of the pass-through cost and customer bills. So while there is near-term adjustments to cash flow that we'll need to navigate, we're confident in our ability to do that. And as evidenced by our reaffirmation of 2018 guidance back in December, Donald can provide some additional insights and details but one of the things that we've looked at is the key to the retention of interest expense deductibility and we're able to retain that through one of the elements of legal entity restructuring at the subsidiary level that we initiated in early 2017. Among other changes, this effort includes the conversion of NIPSCO to an LLC which was completed just last week, so note that this minor restructuring has no effect on either investors or customers but helps us to retain the overall framework that's so important to us. Donald, any other additional details on our positioning on that?","Donald Brown","I think when you think about the other impact of interest deductibility it did lose some value from the interest tax shield going from 35% to 21% but we've got levers from an O&M standpoint and financing standpoint and regulatory mechanisms that allows us to offset that and maintain our earnings commitment for 2018 and going forward.","Paul Ridzon","Donald, you indicated you hedged $1 billion of interest rate risk; did you expense that in '17 or will that be amortized over the pedal [ph] as you put it in place?","Donald Brown","That will be amortized over a bit late [ph].","Operator","Our next question comes from Shah [ph] with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","One question on the Holdco debt, the $2 billion that historically is in like an inter-company loan to the utilities. Joe, just -- so basically, by NIPSCO turning into a LLC you classified NiSource as a regulated utility which is how you sort of got that carve out?","Joseph Hamrock","That's a fair characterization.","Unidentified Analyst","And then, let me just -- sort on over the equity, and you guys have historically have guided to $200 million to $300 million in equity through internal programs, and you've talked about sort of being opportunistic depending on where your balance sheet metrics got to shake out. Just remind us, what's the status of the internal programs for '18? Is there any preliminary indications that this range could change? And sort of more importantly, as you guys are having discussions with the commissioners, is there sort of any prelim talk about potentially retaining some of the tax savings and maybe deploying it into needed infrastructure; so, i.e. accelerate some spending versus immediate credits to the repairs [ph]?","Donald Brown","I think it's orally -- we're in 7 states having conversations with our regulators regarding tax reform and those impacts. In most cases, we have made filings to provide information around those deferred tax adjustments and what those impacts could be on customers. I think what we've got is flexibility, at this point if you think about being in 7 states having the number of infrastructure programs we've got in places, as well as the NIPSCO gas case and the Ohio CEP program that -- I think we've got an ability to manage the cash impact overtime through those different programs and maintain our earnings and dividend growth commitments.","Unidentified Analyst","You guys have utilized your levers extremely well, so whether it's on the O&M side or whether it's been sort of their refinancing program, is there anything first of all left on the refi program? And then are you still comfortable sort of guiding towards flat O&M profile, even beyond your current outlook, especially when you sort of utilized the levers of the NIPSCO in Columbia Gas merger?","Donald Brown","So, I'll start first on the refinancing. When we refinanced the debt last May, we only refinanced about half of that debt, there are still maturities in 2019, 2020 and 2022; so we'll continue to look at those and see if there is opportunity to refinance that and provide savings and value for our shareholders but that is not contemplated in our earnings guidance at this point.","Joseph Hamrock","On the O&M side, as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters, the O&M increases in 2017 were largely due to the commitments we've made in the areas of safety, reliability, trainings and pretty significant commitments there; all aimed at sustaining value for our customers. In that vein, we also had planned increases to support our customer growth initiative and our customer value strategy which are both off to a great start and underpinned our confidence and the sustainability of our plan and the expectation of flat O&M in 2018 off of the 2017 base; so we're in a really good spot there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein","Could you comment a little bit about any equity that might be needed in order to strengthen the balance sheet as a result of tax reforms and I realized that that might be dependent somewhat on your discussions with regulators throughout the year? And how that discussions go regarding preserving cash flows or amortization regulatory assets and things like that? Can you talk about the need for equity and perhaps the timing of when you would be able to announce that need and more specifics around that?","Donald Brown","As I said, we're working across the 7 states, I think it will take some time. I would expect it's going to be the next 4 to 6 months before we have any clarity from a regulatory perspective on the timing of that path back. At the same time we are having conversations with rating agencies and showing them our plan, as well as scenarios around financing depending on cash flow changes. Again, I think we've got levers in terms of financing that's not just equity, we would look at debt in terms of tenures, historically we've done mostly 30-year debt and so if you shorten that into 3s, and 5s, and 10s; that would provide some savings in FFO. We'd also look at hybrids and preferred that provides you some equity content as well as equity. So I think it's probably 4 to 6 months in terms of the regulatory, that's the part that we're really focusing on at this point and then the financing plan will come out of that.","Michael Weinstein","To what extent are these plans already contemplated inside the 5% to 7% earnings growth rate?","Donald Brown","All of those plans are contemplated. So I think it's coming out in late 2017 right after tax reform was to reaffirm our confidence in our plan and having flexibility and levers to hit our earnings guidance for 2018 as well as long-term.","Michael Weinstein","And does it move it around in a range at all? I mean, what's the low end of the range as a result of any equity that might come out or is this something that had been planned so well in advance that there is essentially no change to 5 or 7; which is it?","Donald Brown","There is essentially no change to the 5 to 7, we think we've got -- we believe we've got levers to hit that range. If you think about what we've always said around the range, lower versus higher, what really drives our earnings year-to-year are regulatory programs and our execution on those regulatory programs. And so that's still the case going forward here, our execution on those programs would get us to the higher range because of timing on those programs or at least how we come out. So no concerns with hitting the high range or at all going forward.","Joseph Hamrock","Couple of things I'd add just to add a little context around that whole picture is, keep in mind that the targeted solution reflects the advocacy work that we were all involved in a year ago. So had a pretty long runway to take it into account all of the various factors that ultimately did show up in the tax reform package; so our plans have been well developed over a year or more now. And then, I'd add to that, on the regulatory side with our -- the puzzle of 7 jurisdictions and [indiscernible] rate mechanisms but it's a little hard to predict specific timing across each of those but given our relatively rapid regulatory cadence across our 7 states, we have every expectation that most of those are settled going into 2019 and that we have essentially build into rate the full effect of the tax reform and reduced interest rates into customers rates going into 2019. So those two kind of book ends to the strategy might help think about how we're framing everything.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Turnure","Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to ask you if you have an update to your rate base growth CAGR long-term of 8% to 10%? And I'm assuming that that's going to be a bit higher now? Is there a confidence that you guys have that given that that's going to positively impact you in the long-term that some of these shorter term things that you're doing to offset the pain of tax reform will kind of transition into that, and in other words, there won't be a year or two where you have the negative of tax reform but you don't have the positive benefit of the higher rate base?","Donald Brown","It's a little early to think through or guide through those. We remain committed to the guidance we provided, previously the 8% to 10% rate base growth from last year. We'll continue to look at our plan as we go through the year ahead, especially with all of the regulatory activity related to tax reform but as we sit here today, the current guidance holds.","Joseph Hamrock","And I'd add that certainly all things being equal, rate base will be higher because of this tax reform. We're just not at a place to -- with the regulatory implementation that needs to take place to state what rate base growth will be. I'd also say that we're not at a point where we would change our CapEx plans, we're still committed to the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion a year.","Christopher Turnure","Just a follow-on from the last question; I think the timing of the next couple kind of key decision tree you guys and regulatory or investor disclosures. You highlighted that the regulatory elements that are probably the most important thing but we also have possibly the IRS coming out with clarity on interest deductibility and then at some point in these three you guys possibly look beyond 2020 for your long-term guidance. So do you think we might kind have a mid-year point in time where there is enough to give us a full update there or we'll have to wait till early 2019?","Donald Brown","I'd say from a long-term plan we have big point of guiding through -- our 2020 was our long-term plan, looks at replacement of our generation capacity. Last year we talked about retiring some of our coal units in 2018 and 2023, and so long-term we need to make some decisions on the replacement of that coal capacity, we're kicking off that IRP program this year and I think by the end of the year we should have clarity on what that CapEx plan if any looks like -- and be able to guide past 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Gregory Gordon","When you expressed confidence in your ability to meet the 5% to 7% growth rate for 2020, I presume you've done the scenario analysis. It looks that while you're up, that metric is today -- will form the [indiscernible] form of what regulatory outcomes will be in the next 12 months or so and then sort of ultimately be solving for differing assumed equity meetings and most of all of those cases your sum is around either 7% range; is that the right way for me to think about it as I try to back path [ph] your confidence and your ability to continue to meet debt earnings targets?","Donald Brown","That's exactly right, Greg. As we started thinking about tax reform and the path back of those savings, we're really looking state by state, trying to understand what those changes could be, what the impacts could be, looking at O&M as well because that impacts FFO, and then as you've said kind of back flopping to see what type of financing would provide us to hit our rating commitments with our agencies, as well as our 5% to 7% earnings growth commitments.","Gregory Gordon","So there the scenario is will you get constructive rate outcomes, there is minimal equity needs and you're at the high end of the range in those -- because other outcomes where you get less constructive outcomes and you hold off the cost levers more but you need more equity and you might trip towards the middle of low end of the range; is that the right way to think about it?","Donald Brown","Yes, certainly you could have scenarios in all of those directions.","Joseph Hamrock","In any given year that's true.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman","On the dividend increase, you had certainly a terrific increase last month. Can I assume the 5% to 7% dividend increase, annual dividend increase growth is based on that new dividend?","Donald Brown","That is correct. We've raised the dividend and what we've always stated was that we'd have -- we target about a payout of 60% to 70% with our earnings growth from 2016 to 2017 as well as our guidance of $1.26 to $1.32. For next year the 11% increase was really in line with our long-term commitments around growth in dividend payout.","Charles Fishman","Second question; you've had $10 billion of identified long-term infrastructure for your Indiana electric operations for quite some time and I realized you're in the middle of IRP but does that -- does the $10 billion, is that more than just T&D? In other words, is there any other coal plan environmental projects that are in there, is there any new gas plan in there? What is it in that $10 billion?","Joseph Hamrock","We've refreshed that at Investor Day last year, so that was -- that number is about a year old at this point and it does reflect the full suite of investments across generation transmission and distribution, predominantly on the T&D side but if you look at our generation strategy, there is the anticipation of new generation inside that number as well as -- I call it a tail on the environment spend, the EOG spend is in the next decade. So you'll see a little bit of all of that mixed into that picture, as well as some customer growth.","Charles Fishman","When you say the tail of the environmental spend; is there other units at Schaefer and Michigan or that are still out there that need some work [ph]?","Joseph Hamrock","No, we're in the CCR investment cycle right now, so that piece is a part of that. Keep in mind, we filed a $400 million CPCN last year for environmental retrofits, both, CCR and EOG compliance related investments, we have a settlement and approval on the CCR side but the EOG rule has been stayed. So that spend is still anticipated, it was included in the $10 billion and likely falls out beyond 2020.","Charles Fishman","So it sounds like you just have a plug in there for potentially a new gas plant and obviously the outcome of the ROP [ph] might drive that? I hope you refine it.","Joseph Hamrock","That's correct, yes. In the last IRP we did show a combined cycle plan, so it's consistent with the last IRP but as was noted earlier, Donald touched on this; we will go through a new integrated resource planning cycle this year starting next month, first stakeholder meeting next month and so we'll go through a full market analysis, we'll do an RFP to see what's available in the market, look at our build options and as we cycle through that around the end of this year we should have a much more updated picture of those expectations but that was included in the $10 billion -- about $800 million or so in the $10 billion.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next comes from Faisal Khan with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Ryan [ph] for Faisal. Do you anticipate changing the duration or tenure of your debt obligations to help manage your earnings group outlook? I heard your comments around financing and adjustments to help achieve your guidance?","Donald Brown","Yes, I think it's one of the options that we're looking at is the tenure of future financings going shorter, if necessary to manage our earnings and debt commitments around our ratings.","Unidentified Analyst","And then what was your ATM issuance in the fourth quarter so far this year?","Donald Brown","So last year we did $315 million for the year, in the fourth quarter we did it forward. So part of our ATM program when we established it was a forward mechanism, we did a forward of about $170 million debt, we would close by the end of 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Was there any issuance in the last few months?","Donald Brown","There was not. So $314 million for the total year of 2017 and the we did a forward for $170 million for 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","And has there been any updates around the status of the IRP process with stakeholder engagements in Indiana since the last earnings call? I think you had the meeting next month but any color you can provide around, it's been more of a formal conversation.","Joseph Hamrock","Ryan, no update. We haven't actually initiated the process, the first stakeholder meeting is next month, so we'll set up the process there. Our intent is to go through a full look at diverse portfolio, solution sets including build buy alternatives, and work through that, including an RFP into the market and probably in the second quarter we'll do that. So I'd watch the first second quarter updates for status updates on that, there is not a lot to say about it except it is a very open balanced picture that we want to create to guide that decision.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Joe Hamrock, CEO, for any further remarks.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you, Andrew.

Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs. Please proceed, sir.","Glen Kettering","Thank you, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of NiSource, we\u2019d like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Smith -- Randy Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","As you know, the focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013 and to provide a business update as we enter 2014. We'll then open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we'll refer to the supplemental slides available on nisource.com.","I'd like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Bob Skaggs","Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we noted in this morning\u2019s release for NiSource, 2013 was another year of solid execution, notable achievement and industry leading growth in shareholder value.","On our call today we\u2019ll highlight a number of these achievements and discuss how they position NiSource for continued growth in 2014 and beyond. Then Steve Smith will review our financial highlights. We will also provide updates on key initiatives, outline our 2014 earnings and capital investment guidance, and then of course, we will have plenty of time for your questions.","With that agenda in mind, let\u2019s get started with some key 2013 takeaways. These are listed on slide three in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning.","As you can see our team continued to execute on NiSource\u2019s well-established strategy, generating long-term growth through disciplined infrastructure investments supported by complementary commercial and regulatory initiatives.","Notably, our team delivered earnings in line with our guidance for the seventh consecutive year and we produced total shareholder return of 36%, which outperformed the broader utility indices by a wide margin for the fifth consecutive year.","The foundation of this progress continues to be our deep inventory of long-term accretive modernization and growth investments that investment inventory exceeds $30 billion and continues to grow.","During 2013, our teams delivered against this inventory by executing on a record $2 billion capital program that includes key system modernization, growth in environmental investments.","We saw clear evidence of the value of these investments during this winter's extreme cold weather. Our service territory has been particularly hard hit and our systems have been tested at historical levels.","I'm pleased to report that the system and our teams have performed extraordinarily well. The key factor in that success was our ongoing commitment to fundamentally strengthen and modernize our core infrastructure.","Unfortunately, despite this strong performance, we had an incident on the Columbia Gulf system in Adair County, Kentucky last week, while we are able to meet our commercial commitments, we are disappointed the incident occurred. We've been working closely with them to determine the cause. In parallel with that review our immediate priority is to address the needs of those affected in the surrounding community.","With that, let's turn back to the key takeaways, one of the core pillars of our growth strategy is NiSource\u2019s thoughtful and disciplined financial approach. During 2013, we further strengthen NiSource\u2019s financial foundation and maintained our strong liquidity position, and I am pleased to note that we did so while also providing about a 4% increase our dividend. In addition, just a few weeks ago Moody\u2019s upgraded NiSource\u2019s investment-grade credit rating to Baa2 from Baa3 noting the significant regulatory advancements across our company.","We\u2019ll touch on our financing strategies and core commitments again a bit later but suffices to say we are well-positioned to continue delivering strong performance and steady growth in 2014 and beyond.","With those highlights, I will now turn the call over to Steve Smith to take a look at our financial results on page four of the supplemental slides.","Steve Smith","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, by any measure the NiSource team delivered strong results in 2013. We generated annual non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $494 million or $1.58 per share. That was at the upper end of our guidance range, compares with earnings of about $426 million or $1.46 per share in 2012.","On an operating basis, NiSource was up about $77 million when compared to 2012. On a GAAP comparison our income from continuing operations was about $491 million for 2013 versus about $409 million in 2012.","At the segment level, you will see that each of our three core business units delivered solid earnings growth. Columbia Pipeline Group or CPG delivered operating earnings of about $441 million, compared to about $398 million in 2012.","CPG\u2019s net revenues excluding the impact of trackers, we\u2019re up about $59 million, primarily as a result of 2012 impacts from our system modernization customer settlement. We also saw increased revenues from new growth projects and higher royalties from mineral rights.","Earnings were also up for NIPSCO\u2019s electric operations where earnings came in about $265 million, compared with about $238 million for 2012. Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers were up by about $38 million, primarily due to an increase in environmental investment cost recovery and higher industrial and commercial margins. And finally, our gas distribution business delivered about $449 million in operating earnings, compared to about $438 million for the prior year.","Net revenues, again excluding trackers were up about $77 million, primarily due to regulatory and service programs related to our infrastructure placement efforts. All in all, another solid quarter in year, with full details available in our earning release posted online this morning.","Turning to slide five, I\u2019d like to quickly touch on our financing and liquidity highlights. As Bob noted, our liquidity position remained strong at approximately $1.6 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter.","We took several steps to strengthen NiSource\u2019s financial foundation during 2013. This included issuing $1.25 billion of 30-year debt at attractive rates and our team also increased the size of revolving credit facility by $500 million to $2 billion and extended its terms until September of 2018. Overall, we ended 2013 with the debt to capitalization of 60%.","As Bob mentioned, another significant milestone, Moody\u2019s recently upgraded our credit rating to Baa2 from Baa3. In December, Fitch rating affirmed our credit rating of BBB minus and we anticipate hearing from Standard & Poor in the next few weeks.","Looking ahead, our financial strategy continues to be strong, sustainable and fully-aligned with a robust long-term capital investment outlook.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bob to cover our business unit initiatives and our 2014 guidance.","Bob Skaggs","Thanks, Steve. Before opening the call to questions, we will quickly hit on some key marker across each of our business units. Let\u2019s start with the CPG highlights on slide six. Our CPG team continues to deliver on all fronts, from modernization to midstream to regulated pipeline growth projects. From a modernization standpoint, I\u2019m pleased to note that we received FERC approval in late January for recovery of CPG\u2019s first year of modernization investments. That -- that included more than 30 projects representing a total investment of about $300 million. We started recovery on those investments on February 1st.","Meanwhile, our CPG team is fully engaged in this year's modernization program which includes another $300 million in investment. As you know, our customers have agreed to the initial five years of the program with an opportunity to mutually extend that agreement. Overall we indemnify the total modernization opportunity of more than $4 billion.","In the late breaking news category, I'm pleased to announce that CPG has entered into binding precedent agreements for a major new project, the Cameron Access Project. In addition, the upgrades on the existing Columbia Gulf System in Southern Louisiana, this project involves construction of the new pipeline connecting the gulf system with the planned Cameron LNG Terminal in Southern Louisiana, which received Department of Energy Export approval just last week.","This is a $300 million plus investment for CPG that will connect numerous shale basins to the LNG export facility. The Cameron Access will have an initial capacity about 800,000 dekatherms per day. It is expected to be in service by the end of 2017. Meanwhile CPG\u2019s midstream team is continuing to capitalize on our strategic position in the Marcellus and Utica regions.","In December, we began operating Hickory Bend gathering and processing facility in Eastern Ohio. You may recall that project will provide about 600 million cubic feet per day of new gathering capacity and about 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in that region.","Our team also is moving forward with other related facilities in the Hickory Bend area, including a separate natural gas liquids pipeline that connects to the Hickory Bend plan to the UEO Kensington facility in Columbiana County, Ohio. Starting in the third quarter this year, the line will ultimately deliver up to 90,000 barrels of liquids per day. As a reminder, these projects are part of our joint venture with Hilcorp Energy.","Speaking of Hilcorp, our joint resource development arrangement in the Utica is moving forward consistent with our plans. 20 wells are now in various stages of drilling and another 10 wells are currently in production. We remain encouraged that the initial production flows are consistent with some of the better flows reported in the area.","Drilling activity will continue to accelerate in 2014. We anticipate that beginning this year we will be completing 25 to 30 wells annually. All in all, it's very much in line with our expectations and strongly supportive of our complementary infrastructure investments. As a reminder, the production is dedicated to the Pennant Midstream gathering and processing facilities.","Shifting to the Marcellus region, NiSource Midstream recently entered into an agreement with Range Resources to provide firm transportation services on the Big Pine gathering system, which was placed in service in April 2013. The agreement provides for transportation of up to 100 million cubic feet per day. As a reminder, the project was anchored with long-term gathering contracts with XTO Energy and Penn Energy. Big Pine is capable of transporting up to 425 million cubic foot per day of Marcellus production.","Finally, a quick touch on several key supply and market-driven growth projects being advanced by CPG. In total, our team is executing on more than $0.5 billion worth of projects that will add about 1 billion cubic feet of capacity to our system over the next two years. Looking a little further out, this number doubles in investment and doubles in capacity.","Most recently, the team received FERC approval on its Line 1570, Giles County projects that we previously discussed. We also recently completed a key portion of the West Side Expansion project when we reversed the flow on a portion of the Columbia Gulf System. That enables our 500 million cubic feet per day of shale gas to flow south from our Leach, Kentucky interconnect toward Rayne, Louisiana.","CPG also successfully completed non-binding open seasons for two companion projects, the Leach XPress and the Rayne Xpress. Those projects would further connect shale production with markets on Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf. We\u2019re currently in active discussions with potential anchor shippers and will keep you posted as these exciting projects move forward.","As you can see, CPG team is executing on an impressive array of initiatives. Those efforts will result in a disciplined capital investment of about $800 million at CPG this year.","Now let's shift to our Indiana electric business summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO continues to advance the broad agenda of customer service, reliability and environmental improvements, just yesterday another vitally significant milestone for us, the IURC approved NIPSCO seven-year electric modernization plan, which encompasses approximately $1.1 billion of investments to modernize the electric infrastructure in Northern Indiana. Initial investments under this program will begin by mid-2014.","NIPSCO\u2019s $700 million gas modernization filing remains on schedule with the IURC, with the decision expected by midyear. Both the electric and gas plans are closely aligned with Indiana legislation, providing for timely recovery of qualifying modernization investments.","Another significant milestone is the installation of the two new scrubber units at our Schahfer generating station. The first FGD was completed on budget and ahead of schedule late last year, and the second unit is on track for completion by the end of this year. Work has also started on third FGD project at our Michigan City station, that project is slated to be complete by the end of 2015.","In total, more than $850 million in environmental investments are moving forward at NIPSCO. NIPSCO also is on track with two major electric transmission projects, a 100 mile, 345-kV line and 66 mile, 765-kV line. These projects together constitute an investment of approximately $0.5 billion for NIPSCO, and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.","All total, NIPSCO has an inventory of more than $6 billion in long-term investments that will benefit customers and provide a platform for economic development across Northern Indiana. During 2014, the capital investments in NIPSCO\u2019s electric business will total about $450 million.","Let's turn now to our Gas Distribution Operations discussed on Slide 8. Our Gas Distribution teams continued to steadily execute on their long-term $10 billion plus inventory of infrastructure programs. In fact during 2013, our Gas Distribution capital investments reached a record level at $790 million with the largest portion of that investment committed to modernization programs.","Under those programs, our Gas Distribution teams replaced more than 360 miles of aging pipelines last year and as always, we paired those investments with complementary customer programs and regulatory initiatives. On the regulatory front, Columbia Gas Kentucky received approval in December for its rate case settlement. The company's new rates, which took effect December 29th, provide for an increased fixed customer charge and about $8 million in additional annual revenues. The rates support the company's ongoing modernization investments.","The Columbia Gas Massachusetts rate proceeding also remains on track with the decision expected in new rates in effect by March 1st. You recall that CMA is seeking increase revenues of about $30 million to support the company's expanded modernization plans. Our distribution team also continues to execute on organic and market-driven growth opportunities.","This includes development of a $15 million project that will serve a major Columbia Gas of Virginia industrial customer starting in late 2014. As part of the same project, Columbia Gas Transmission will separately invest about $25 million to extend its system to interconnect with Columbia Gas of Virginia.","As we roll into 2014, we are confident our Gas Distribution team\u2019s well-established approach for creating shared value for customers and key stakeholders will continue to deliver solid results. We target about $815 million of Gas Distribution capital spending for 2014, again, focused primarily on modernization and growth initiatives.","Before turning to your questions, let's quickly touch on our guidance for 2014 and a couple of key takeaways. With over $2 billion in capital investments underway for 2014, we fully expect to deliver on our core commitments including consistently generating earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range over the long-term.","For 2014, we expect to deliver net operating earnings within a range of $1.61 to a $1.71 per share non-GAAP. I\u2019d also reiterate that we\u2019ll execute on this proven strategy, while staying true to our well-established core commitments. We will maintain stable investment-grade credit ratings, strong financial liquidity and dividend growth in the range of 3% to 5% annually.","As always, we'll communicate on all matters with importance in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and in support of NiSource.","Patrick, we can now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And gentlemen, our first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Good morning.","Bob Skaggs","Hey, Paul, how are you?","Steve Smith","Good morning, Paul","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Hi, thank you. Leaching rain, how big a capital opportunity is there?","Bob Skaggs","Assuming we can drive this home, it\u2019s going to be a major, major investment. You can see that we have work on Columbia Gas Transmission that typically requires a relatively large investment. We\u2019ll also be investing on Columbia Gulf and big scheme of things, that\u2019s relatively small, expect the spends to be unfolding in \u201916 and \u201917, again assuming we can close these deals.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And then, just on the modernization besides your settlement, have you started talking about an extension of that and what\u2019s the outlook to may be go above 300 when you do extend it, if you extend it?","Bob Skaggs","Well, like when we extend it. Paul, a little bit too early to get into those sorts of discussions with our customers and other stakeholders. Clearly we\u2019ve only been at this year. We have been very pleased with the performance of the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We think the investments have shown their value to the customers. So we felt like we need to get one year of construction, hard winter under our belts, and another construction season in the ground. And then, it will be appropriate to begin discussions with the stakeholders. So stay tuned.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And lastly, just latest thoughts on some of the hurdles around forming alternative structure in MLP?","Bob Skaggs","Oh, the MLP? Yeah, this discussion will be consistent with our prior discussions. We still consider the MLP vehicle to be very viable for NiSource, it\u2019s a viable approach, a viable option. We can\u2019t continue to closely study it, closely work the consideration among the management team but also the board.","Paul, I would add true to our form, it\u2019s going to be a thoughtful, thorough sort of discipline consideration. We continue to indicate to you and others to expect the decision circa third quarter of 2014. And I would just make the observation, not coincidently, that\u2019s about nine to 12 months in advance when we believe we will need equity or an equity alternative in 2015. So in the mean time, as you can tell the team is focused on projects development and our initiatives. So just stay tuned.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed your line is open.","Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bob Skaggs","Hey, Steve","Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley","I had two questions on the quarter and one on growth. Can\u2019t be apply the small drop in earnings and about $8 million in the quarter and you talked about really shorter-term -- decreases in shorter-term transportation services. How much impact was that in the quarter? And then an increase in other revenues in that segment, is that from midstream?","Steve Smith","Yeah, I would say -- this is Steve, I would say the decrease in revenues for -- net revenues for CPG was around the $5 million for the quarter. And midstream did drive some benefits to us, but again it was in the couple of million dollar range, nothing too significant.","Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then looking in terms of throughput on Columbia Gulf, just want to understand you saw like a book to bill of 30% year-on-year decline in the numbers 4Q over 4Q. Can you just give us some more color there and what\u2019s the outlook, is it somehow related to part of the West side expansion, reversing flow or what are we looking at with those numbers there?","Steve Smith","Yeah, Steve, I think in the macro sense, you are seeing what the entire industry is seeing with Marcellus and Utica that customers are relying less on Gulf region gas and they are relying on gas that\u2019s in \u201cThe Northeast\u201d and that\u2019s what you are seeing and you are seeing Marcellus and others look at ways to repurpose, turnaround, go by directional on these long line pipes from the Gulf region to the market region.","So we believe our efforts and example would be the West side which renders one of our line bidirectional. It\u2019s a great example of what we are attempting to do to move gas north to south fully utilized Columbia Gulf. What Paul also mentioned the express is open season is really a variant on that as well, moving gas out of the Marcellus, Utica region to liquid points of interaction, west on the Columbia Gas Transmission and then all the way down the Gulf system. So it\u2019s just a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the market.","Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Appreciate that. And then final for me on Pennant Midstream, just the thoughts on the 600 million cubic feet a day of gathering, 200 of processing, in terms of how we should think about the volume ramp? And then sort of the reminder, are those capacities spoken for or are we expecting a volume ramp to get to those numbers over \u201914 and into \u201915 and does the same hold true for that NGL line?","Bob Skaggs","Hilcorp would be the primary driver of the initial phases of volume ramp. So they are really driving the project. Now are we looking at opportunities to bring additional volumes onto the Hilcorp or onto the Pennant System? That would be yes.","But again I repeat Hilcorp is really the key driver in gathering volumes and the processing volumes. And Hilcorp\u2019s intent, you see reflected in their drilling program. First things first, they want to fill up the 200 million a day processing facility. So that's what they're attempting to do first and foremost and as quickly as they can.","And then phases two and three would be additional processing facilities of the Hickory Bend site. So that\u2019s the game plan. And again if we\u2019re successful in bringing additional volumes in our activity to Pennant, then you might see that schedule accelerated.","Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley","Okay. I appreciate it guys. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Good morning guys.","Bob Skaggs","Hey Faisel.","Steve Smith","Good morning Faisel.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Good morning. So wondered if you guys could discuss some of the taking place in the market over the last couple of months. I guess, there was a trade publication article talked about how Dominion was looking for a Midwest utility when it was raising capital to possibly buyout utility in Midwest. And at the same time, I guess, around the same time, I\u2019m not sure if this is related or not. You guys change your change in control in termination agreements. So can you again discuss how you and the board are thinking about M&A. And if any of the stuff is related to sort of what\u2019s out there in the market?","Bob Skaggs","Yeah, let me talk about the change control agreements. Every year as we expect the boards looking to change control agreements and what we did with those was simply to remove the gross up provision in those change of control agreements to make them contemporary or leading edge with good corporate governance. That was absolutely all that was involved in that. Again it\u2019s an annual process that we do with the board or comp committee.","Now rumors, as you would expect, we don't comment on rumors but maybe I can make couple of observations. Number one, we\u2019re an $11 billion equity value company with I think extraordinarily strong standalone plan. So everything we do is kind of measured against what I think is a really, really strong, strong plan that we know we can execute on.","And then the second observation is we\u2019re always going to do the right thing for the shareholder. So that\u2019s really all we can say about rumors and speculation and things of that nature.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. That\u2019s fair, I appreciate that. And then just going back to some of the comments around the Xpress projects, what\u2019s the aggregate amount of capacity that\u2019s contemplated on those? And would all that capacity be eligible to be reversed essentially out of the Marcellus, Utica down to the Gulf Coast markets.","Bob Skaggs","Well, again these are two companion open seasons activity on Columbia Gas Transmission. So in the market, in the Marcellus and Utica region and Columbia Gulf, our total capacities would be north of a Bcf a day.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay.","Bob Skaggs","As I kind of alluded to Paul, major projects assuming to goes forward, major projects assuming to goes forward.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","The entire 1 Bcf a day would be able to make it to the Gulf Coast markets.","Bob Skaggs","A little south of that, all the way down to the Gulf, but again we\u2019re looking at expansion opportunities on Columbia Gas Transmission, increase deliveries into Gulf. But then what ultimately moves south on Gulf would be more like $800 million to $900 million a day.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Got it.","Bob Skaggs","Just again, to give you the parameters and just to underscore, we are in discussions, situation is fluid, a lot of wood to chop to get from here to there what you guys sense that it's bigger than the bread box.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Last question, on your overall storage capacity in the Mid-Atlantic I guess and Midwest market. Are you seeing any sort of change in the demand for storage capacity in your area given all the production growth taking place?","Bob Skaggs","Well, our storage is fully contracted on long-term agreements, so we are absolutely sold out. And I think one thing that's constructive about this winter is how gosh darn valuables storage is of regardless what's going in the Utica and Marcellus and how valuable firm transport capacity is in this region. So, I think that it just underscores we think the value of the Columbia Gas Transmission system.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Great. Thanks Bob. Appreciate the time.","Bob Skaggs","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Thank you. If I could circle back at the MLP question again, I just want to make sure I understand that. The two hurdles you had discussed in the past were tax leakage and the lack of flexibility on the backside which we are waiting obviously we get some help from Moody\u2019s. Is tax leakage still a concern that you are going to have to progress before that happens?","Bob Skaggs","Hey, just for clarity for everybody that\u2019s listening, in the past, we\u2019ve talked about investment grade credit, how sacrosanct that is and so we\u2019ve been very mindful of credit considerations and anything that might be a negative on our credit. We have also talked about tax leakage because our assets are low basis assets.","We have also tried to consistently indicate that we are working, studying, engineering on both fronts and that we have gotten more comfortable with credit considerations in general and we have also been more comfortable in ways to manage structure in and around tax leakage.","But that\u2019s as far as we have gone. Again I eluded in my comments to, Paul, we continue to closely study, we continue to closely work and we\u2019ll be thorough in discipline as we work through those issues.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","So, let\u2019s say you have been trying to make a decision on this by later this year, third quarter, I believe you said, that would impact the amount of equity in \u201915, if that were to occur?","Bob Skaggs","Well, speaking hypothetically, if we pursued an MLP that would be in-lieu of common equity.","Steve Smith","Right.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Well, okay.","Steve Smith","We\u2019ll do one or the other?","Bob Skaggs","Yeah. Now size\u2026","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Okay.","Bob Skaggs","\u2026 as you would have to get there and make those determinations. But again hypothetically it would replace the need for common equity.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Just, Bob, I know, just in general, you have this new line going to an invest your customer in Virginia, is there other utilities talk about the impact of industrial growth, impact because of investors fair view of natural gas prices in the U.S. for an extended period of time, do you think I (inaudible) customer?","Bob Skaggs","These were -- I don\u2019t want to speak directly, but we have seen environmental considerations drive certain projects of this nature. Now, obviously, they have a strong business but there are environmental considerations at play.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Okay. Thank you.","Bob Skaggs","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Please proceed.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Bob Skaggs","Hey Carl.","Steve Smith","Hi.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Hey. Just a couple of cleanup questions I have got, one going back to the Leach brand XPress and I guess maybe, can you queue up how you see the milestones going, you mentioned Bob, maybe spending in 2016, 2017, so I would think that would mean, if this project were to move forward for filing by the end of this year? And is this a project that FDU come out of the non-binding you would take sort of first [two precedent] agreements or would you go into -- directly into a binding open season and what might you think the timing of that might be?","Bob Skaggs","All right. You have got a lot of stuff going on that front. Wow! Hey. Let me just put it this way. We are still in active discussions. And so the scenarios around a binding open season, goings with the binding agreements, just premature at this point. We are speaking with the folks, potential anchor shippers. We think those discussions are going forward on an expedited basis but it\u2019s still too early to say what the next steps are. I do think an FERC filing, I think you suggested mid-year, I don\u2019t see that being feasible at all. But I do see possibilities that this could move on an expedited basis.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Great. I appreciate the color. The second question, was just -- could you and I apologize if you had this in your opening commentary as I was taking notes down, but could you refresh my memory what the milestones are for the NIPSCO gas modernization as far as when we would expect to see a decision from the IURC?","Bob Skaggs","We believe we will see a decision on an outcome midyear of this year. Just a point of reference, we\u2019re holding or the IURC is holding a hearing on the gas filing today as we speak in Indianapolis. Now, I would also make the observation that with yesterday\u2019s order on the electric T disc, we certainly have gotten some instructions, some clarity, some insight, and hopefully that\u2019s going to be helpful as we process the gas case.","Carl Kirst - BMO Capital","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Bob Skaggs","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Good morning, everybody. Just a sort of follow-up on the MLP question. It sounds like you are getting more comfortable with the possibility of the MLP option maybe and I don\u2019t know if you had a comment on this at this point, but is there anything at this point that you think would prevent you from pursuing the MLP option?","Bob Skaggs","I think we just need to complete the process, working closely with the board and with the team and we need to work through the process.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. All right, great. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Bob Skaggs","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We have a follow-up question from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. Last time, on the last call, you talked about the fact that with SB560 because it\u2019s a new law in Indiana, there was a high probability that there would be some litigation, is that (inaudible) approval and order you\u2019ve got yesterday reduce that or do you think that\u2019s still the case?","Bob Skaggs","The decision yesterday was the product litigation. The case went through the hearing process, the briefing process, all phases of litigation, and so what the commission did was they acted on a complete record on the program and made the decision.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Okay. So there is very low probability or no probability of any continuing litigation on that?","Bob Skaggs","Well, parties would have the right to appeal and that sort of thing. We feel good about the order, we feel good the way the process unfolded, so we are bullish that we will be executing against the program beginning midyear.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Okay, fantastic. Thank you.","Bob Skaggs","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Being that there are no remaining questions in queue, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bob Skaggs for closing remarks.","Bob Skaggs","Patrick, thanks so much and thanks to everyone for your participation today, your ongoing support of NiSource. And as we mentioned, we will communicate clearly and frequently. So thank you very much. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"15369":["NiSource (NYSE:NI) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 31, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Glen L.

My name is Deluj, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs. Please proceed, sir.","Glen L. Kettering","Thank you, and good morning. On behalf of NiSource, I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy  Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","The focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the second quarter of this year and to provide a business update. We'll then open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we'll refer to the supplemental slides available on our website at nisource.com. I'd like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking and these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning those risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Glen. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Today's agenda is focused and brief with plenty of time for questions. We'll first review our second quarter earnings which at mid-year continue to be solid, sustainable and on track with our 2012 outlook. We'll then touch on key achievements across each of our business units. We'll next provide additional color on our Gas Transmission system modernization effort, as well as our significant midstream projects in the Utica and Marcellus.  Shale regions, and then we'll open the line to your questions.","Let's start with a few key second quarter takeaways, which you'll find on Slide 3 of the supplemental deck posted online this morning. As you can see, each of our 3 business units continues to deliver on a robust combination of infrastructure modernization, growth and regulatory initiatives that together, deliver significant benefits for our customers and solid value for our shareholders.","Here are a few highlights. First and foremost, we advanced several key Gas Transmission and midstream initiatives. We also saw steady earnings growth from our ongoing, industry-leading system modernization and regulatory initiatives. To date, those efforts have focused primarily on our Gas Distribution business, but we're now expanding that scope to include our Gas Transmission system. During the quarter, we also took steps to reduce our financing costs and strengthen our financial foundation. This disciplined financial strategy provides us with flexibility to support our deep and growing inventory of earnings accretive capital investment opportunities.","For 2012, those investment opportunities total over $1.4 billion. We also continued to build shareholder value when our board announced a 4%-plus annualized increase in NiSource's dividend. Great news for shareholders, particularly when coupled with our ongoing earnings growth.","And finally, as I noted earlier, our team's continued strong performance enables us to confirm that halfway through the year, we're on pace to achieve our 2012 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. So with that backdrop, let's take a closer look at our second quarter results starting with our financial highlights on Slide 4.","As you can see, NiSource delivered net operating earnings non-GAAP of almost $67 million or $0.23 per share for the 3 months ended June 30. That compares with about $47 million or $0.17 per share for the second quarter of 2011. Our operating earnings for the quarter increased from about $164 million to over $202 million. On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations for the quarter was about $71 million compared to about $41 million in 2011. Schedules 1 and 2 to our earnings release shows the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.","Let's turn now to our individual business unit results starting with our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage operations, highlighted on Slide 5. Needless to say, it was an extremely busy, productive quarter for CEO, Jimmy Staton and the entire NGT&S team, and that progress has continued into the third quarter. From a numbers perspective, NGT&S had a solid quarter, generating operating earnings of nearly $92 million compared to about $85 million for the same period last year. The primary revenue drivers were growth projects placed into service, as well as increased equity earnings for Millennium Pipeline. The team also continued to develop and execute infrastructure investment opportunities in existing and new markets including midstream projects to serve the Utica and Marcellus Shale regions. Most notably, we recently announced 2 expansive venturers with affiliates of Hilcorp Energy in the heart of the liquids-rich Eastern portion of the Utica. One arrangement is focused on developing midstream infrastructure and the other is focused on hydrocarbon development.","Now prior to discussing the dimensions of the Hilcorp bills, I need to provide a caveat and   make a pitch. The caveat is that because Hilcorp is fully engaged in the very competitive acreage acquisition mode, we simply can't provide extensive detail. However, this morning, we'll certainly provide meaningful highlights and a bit of color around the deal's key elements. And that leads to my pitch. I know that you're eager for more information on our midstream progress along with our other growth initiatives. I ask you to please stay tuned. We're looking forward to sharing additional details, un-peeling the onion, if you will, at our upcoming investor day that will be on September 12 in New York City, with an online simulcast.","So now back to Hilcorp. Hilcorp is one of the nation's leading independent oil and gas producers with an outstanding track record of operational success including deep experience in shale development and with notable financial strength. For us, an absolutely great fit. Our infrastructure JV called Pennant Midstream will invest about $300 million in its first phase within service during the second half of 2013. In the 50-50 partnership, NiSource will construct and operate the facilities and contribute half of the required capital. Once construction of the first phase is complete, the system will provide about 400 million cubic feet per day of gathering capacity and approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capabilities. I note that although the first phase of the gathering system is anchored by Hilcorp's production, the network is being engineered and built with expansion in mind. This includes additional processing capacity and pipeline facilities as producer demand in the area evolves. To that point, we're actively marketing that capacity. Ultimately, we expect the total tenant investment opportunity could easily exceed $1 billion.","Directly tied to the infrastructure JV is a separate joint arrangement with Hilcorp, focused on developing their hydrocarbon potential on a significant combined acreage position in the Utica. NiSource contributed roughly 14,000 acres of mineral rights in northeast Ohio. In return, we're receiving upfront cash and the carried interest to help fund our interest in the total combined acreage position. In effect, the arrangement provides for a self-funding, nonoperating working production interest, plus royalties. All told, these interests could amount to over 5% of the combined acreage plus the joint arrangement provides for a multiyear drilling program that's already underway, with significant base case production building in 2013. And last, but perhaps the most compelling strategic value as suggested moment ago, the entire multi-county area of mutual [ph] interest is dedicated to the Pennant infrastructure JV. So to say the least, both of these agreements are significant for NiSource. They provide near- and long-term earnings growth opportunities via core infrastructure investment as well as leverage our strategic mineral interests. They also provide a model of what we hope to accomplish across our remaining acreage position as delineation [ph], development and producer activity in the Utica region continues.","One final midstream update. Work is continuing on the $150 million Big Pine Gathering System in Western Pennsylvania. Anchored by a long-term agreement with XTO energy, this project is expected to be in service this December. In addition to our midstream progress, NGT&S continues to build an inventory of customer focus expansion opportunities along our existing system. For example, Columbia Gas Transmission and Columbia Gulf Transmission are moving forward with our West Side expansion project, which will help address changing supply and market demands by reversing a part of our system. The change will enable us to transport about 500,000 dekatherms per day of Marcellus production, originating in Southwest Pennsylvania and North Central West Virginia to Gulf Coast markets. That's an approximately $200 million project with in-service targeted for late 2014. Development is also continuing on our East Side expansion project, which I mentioned on the first quarter call. That project would also help address changing supply and demand dynamics in the highly competitive and capacity-constrained Eastern markets.","As a reminder, to help you track these projects, we have a map and project slide on Page 9 of the Appendix in our supplemental slides.","Before moving to our other business units, one final update, that's progress on the Columbia Gas Transmission modernization program. As you know, we've been engaged in a series of discussions with our customers regarding a comprehensive, long-term infrastructure modernization program. Similar to the programs at our gas utilities, we view this as a win-win from a customer and public policy standpoint. It'll enhance the reliability and flexibility of our pipeline system and ensure continued safe and reliable service. It'll also generate jobs, fuel economic growth and position our system well in advance for anticipated regulatory requirements. In total, we expect the plan could involve an investment of about $4 billion over a 10- to 15-year period. Our discussions with customers are covered by nondisclosure agreements, so I can't say much at this time other than they are advancing, and we hope to have news to share with you by Investor Day. To note, on prior calls, our goal is to reach a compressive agreement with our customers and other stakeholders and submit it to the FERC for approval by year's end. So as you can see, our Gas Transmission Storage team continues to aggressively advance a broad array of initiatives to enhance customer service, assure continued system reliability, and leverage our unparalleled strategic position in shale production regions.","Let's now shift to Indiana and our Electric business as summarized on Slide 6. Our NIPSCO electric team is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year by executing on a historic level of environmental investment, customer focus, and community and economic development.","NIPSCO's quarter was solid and squarely in line with our plan. Operating earnings came in at about $60 million compared to about $38 million for the same period last year. Revenues were up about $30 million due to increased margins as a result of regulatory initiatives and the expiration of several large customer contracts, now subject to current rates [ph].","Operating expenses increased about $8 million largely due to higher depreciation of cost associated with our Sugar Creek generating station that were deferred prior to the resolution of our electric brake case [ph].","During the recent wave of sustained high temperatures and severe southern storms, NIPSCO's operating electric infrastructure has performed exceptionally well. In fact, the company reached an all-time peak load in late June, exceeding 3,700 megawatts. One note on those summer storms, although we've certainly had our share, NIPSCO's operations and customer service teams have responded with solid efficiency, safety and concern for our customers. We've also had our share of restoration in storm repair costs, but those costs are within expectations and are not expected to significantly impact this year's earnings, tremendous work by our team.","On the customer front, NIPSCO requested Indiana commission approval of the Green Power Rate pilot program. The program would allow customers to designate a portion or all of their monthly electric usage to power generated by renewable energy sources. And of course, cornerstone of NIPSCO's business agenda is executing in our $500 million investment in new scrubber equipment at our Schahfer Generating Station. That project, which remains fully on track is part of $850 million in environmental investments that we'll make in NIPSCO through 2018. A footnote, we're expecting Indiana commission approval of a separate scrubber project at our Michigan City generating station within a matter of months.","On another positive note, we have an encouraging update on NIPSCO's 100-mile 340 KV transmission project. On July 19, we received FERC approval for construction rate incentives and cost protections. As we mentioned previously, this project is part of MISO's broad-ranging system improvement initiative and scheduled to be in service during the latter part of the decade.","Before moving to our Gas Distribution business, I want to note that several NIPSCO employees including CEO, Jimmy Staton, will be ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow to commemorate NIPSCO's 100th anniversary and our 50th year listed on the exchange, it's another great opportunity to recognize the proud history and incredible progress made by our team.","Let's now turn to our Gas Distribution Operations discussed on Slide 7. Our Gas Distribution team led by our new group CEO, Joe Hamrock, continues to deliver strong steady and predictable results from our well-established strategy of lining long-term infrastructure enhancement programs with complementary customer programs and rate design initiatives.","For the quarter, Gas Distribution net revenues were up $8 million, primarily reflecting regulatory and infrastructure programs. Going forward, the team continues to execute on our deep inventory of infrastructure enhancement projects, spanning nearly all our Gas Distribution service territory. These initiatives are part of a long-term investment program that totals at least $4 billion, and frankly, there could be even greater investment opportunities going forward. Again, stay tuned for our September 12 Investor Day.","On the regulatory front, we remain on track with the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts base rate case, which scheduled for decision in late October. That case is designed to support the company's infrastructure modernization and replacement plans with timely investment recovery.","Columbia Gas Pennsylvania also is on track to follow rate case later this quarter to reflect the new Pennsylvania Act 11 regulatory enhancements that'll support our well-established infrastructure modernization program in the commonwealth.","And on the legislative front, Columbia Gas Virginia played a key role in advancing that state's natural gas infrastructure expansion for economic development or the need legislation, which also provides gas utilities to defer costs associated with infrastructure expansion for recovery for future rate cases.","So across the board our gas distribution companies continue to deliver an innovative programs to customers and solid financial performance for shareholders.","Before moving to your questions, let me briefly touch on the status of our core financial commitments and solid financial profile. As I noted earlier, NiSource remains on track to deliver net operating earnings in line with our full-year outlook of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. We're also staying true to our disciplined financial approach and our commitment to maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rate.","During the quarter, we took a number of actions to reduce borrowing costs and support our robust capital investment program. This included extending our $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement through 2017, completing a $250 million bank term loan and issuing $750 million in long-term debt at historically attractive rates. We also remain on track to draw on our 210 -- 2010 $400 million forward equity sale in September.","So to close out, the NiSource team is continuing to execute on a proven and promising business strategy. That strategy provides for near term's earnings growth, as well as a broad and deep portfolio of long-term investment opportunity. Add to that our commitment to a solid investment-grade financial foundation providing flexibility to fund our infrastructure investment program. And top it off with a secure, attractive and growing dividend and a recent track record of providing industry-leading total shareholder return. That's a compelling investment proposition in anyone's book.","As we open the line to questions, I want to plug one more time our Investor Day on September 12 in New York City. At the meeting and via Internet simulcast, we'll share additional updates and details on our growth plans. And as always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thank you for participating today, and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Deluj, let's now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first question comes from the line of Stephen Maresca of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just hoping maybe from a bigger picture on the joint venture. Can you discuss at all any sort of commodity sensitivity that you would have around some of these joint venture arrangements or is that something that you can't talk about right now?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, again in the spirit of big picture, 50,000 feet, the exposure to commodity is nil if any [ph]. On the infrastructure side, we have the dedication of the entire multi-county area of interest. So that's going to be supported by that, that drilling program and production. It's not a percentage of proceeds or anything like that. It's going to be fee-based. Our working interest, royalty interest, again at 50,000 feet, is relatively small on the big scheme of things.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And you said you contributed on the developing of the hydrocarbon potential. You're contributing 14,000 acres. So how much more acreage do you have to contribute? Could you replicate this or is that other acreage on [indiscernible] to go towards something with Hilcorp?","Robert C. Skaggs","No, the other acreage is standalone. It's not dedicated or pledged or contracted to Hilcorp. So in the western portion of the Utica window, that acreage is NiSource's. We've mentioned in the past that we're waiting for that area to be delineated, further defined -- so while that activity that unfolds, we continue to hold that acreage.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Westside, the backhaul that you're doing, is there anything that needs to be done to your system? And do you see more of this happening as the Marcellus grows?","Robert C. Skaggs","Again, in the big scheme of things, the engineering is very, very manageable. It's relatively modest, for the entire project, both the Columbia Gas Transmission work and the Columbia Gulf work, the total is roughly $200 million. The work on Columbia Gulf is for the most part compressor station salving[ph]. And I'd add it's not a backhaul per se on Columbia Gulf. We're going to render one of our 3 Columbia Gulf legs bidirectional. So one leg would become fully bidirectional and so this gas would, in fact, move south. Your other -- the other proportion to your question, could we see more of this occurring and the answer would be yes. That's a possibility. First things first, we'll proceed with this project that was warmly received -- well-received by the marketplace, and we'll look at the other 2 legs as interest develops.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just on the Hilcorp, you mentioned $1 billion potential. Kind of how many years do you see that unfolding over or is that going to be something that we need to wait for September 12 for?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well I think it's sooner rather than later. As suggested in my prepared comments, the agreement does include a drilling program, outlines the drilling program. We'd say that the drilling program is aggressive. Hilcorp has a well-established record of going at this at a pretty good clip and I think if you look at their track record in the Southwest, the Eagle Ford for instance, you'll see a production track that looks pretty aggressive, so we see this occurring over the next 5 years or so --","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And you kind of broke up on the call, I'm sorry, but you said with regards to the modernization projects, you expected to file something by year-end. Could you just kind of -- I think I missed the details there. Sorry.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, there were a lot of details because we are working under confidentiality agreements, nondisclosure agreements with the customers. But we've said, gosh, Paul, for now the better part of a year that our game plan was to deal with this in 2012, and our hope was to have FERC action approval of an arrangement by year-end 2012.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And currently, the rate structure on the pipes is a postage stamp tariff as opposed to a pancake, is that correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well Columbia Gas Transmission and modernization applies to Columbia Gas Transmission. So it's the market area grid pipeline. And you're correct, that rate on Columbia Gas Transmission is a postage stamp.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You mentioned something before the Indiana commission with regards to Michigan City environmental. Would that be incremental to the $850 million of environmental CapEx you've outlined before?","Robert C. Skaggs","It would be included in the $850 million.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Faisel from Citigroup. I just wanted to clarify something in your prepared remarks on the hydrocarbon joint venture. I think you said you have -- the way this joint venture works is that you've contributed your 15,000 acres and you have a carried drilling interest and a non- -- and after this, you have a nonoperated 5% working interest in the 15,000-roughly acres. Is that correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","No. The acreage contributed is roughly 14,000 acres. We're going to combine that with acreage that Hilcorp has and acreage that Hilcorp is acquiring in an area of mutual interest. For the entire combined Hilcorp-NiSource acreage, we'll have a 5% working interest, plus an overriding royalty interest in the entire combined acreage position.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And all you had to do is contribute this 14,000 acres to get this working interest in the entire mutual area?","Robert C. Skaggs","Effectively, that's how the arrangement's structured.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And you already received the cash on this deal, I take it?","Robert C. Skaggs","We will receive -- in return for the contribution, we'll receive a portion in cash upfront. We'll receive the other portion as a working carry, if you will, carried interest. And again, I would remind you just in the spirit of clarity, the entire combined acreage, the mutual area of interest, is then dedicated to the Pennant infrastructure joint venture.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Okay, understood. And then on the Big Pine Gathering System, the 425 million cubic feet per day, how does that ramp up? Is that kind of slowly ramped up over time or is that kind of immediately at 425 million cubic feet per day?","Robert C. Skaggs","It ramps and the key to the ramp is XTO's drilling program. So at the outset, they are the primary driver for the ramp up and throughput. We're in the process of marketing additional capacity on Big Pine similar when we need [ph] to place the capacity. And then those producers, like XTO, need to execute on their drilling program.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then on the pipeline side also, Columbia Gulf, looks like volumes were down about 10% over last year. Can you kind of describe what's going on over there?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, second quarter -- and just to remind you that the second quarter is really a shoulder-off quarter for us and so I wouldn't read too much into the volumes on Columbia golf or for that matter anywhere.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. It's not that there's some sort of volume [indiscernible] from the Gulf Coast?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Yes. I wouldn't read that into it.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And last question about NIPSCO. As you put these covers in place, how does that change your coal buying sort of volumes. I mean are you going to shift more to the Illinois Basin or how is that going to shift your coal purchasing sort of behavior going into the...","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, at the margin we'll be able to -- at the margin we'll be in a position to buy a bit more of Illinois basin coal, but I would say -- and again, very macro, very 50,000 feet - it's not going to radically change our buying patterns.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst of BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a few cleanup questions, maybe if I could and the first on the Pennant JV and recognizing we're kind of [ph] marketing here, but is it possible to say how much of the capacity is going to sort of the Hilcorp anchor [ph]. I'm just trying to figure out how much additional you guys can re-market, meaning, how much more icing might there be?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, I still don't want to go over my skews [ph] at the moment on that, Carl. Again, stay tuned on the 12th and hopefully [Audio Gap] we'll be in a position to give you a little bit better sense on how much, to would say, additional icing there might be.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, fair enough. And the second question, I apologize Bob if you said this in the prepared commentary, but on the West Side expansion, is that something that is -- are those volumes long-term contracted or is this something that we should think of as basically addition to rate base and eventually you'll go to a rate filing on those?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, there's a long-term arrangement. So the investment is supported by long-term agreements with shippers. So from our perspective, it's as long-term and as firm as any other core system breadth [ph] project that we deal with.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, and I appreciate the clarification. And then lastly, if I could, just trying to get a little bit more understanding of this long-term NIPSCO transmission project, the $270 million transmission project. Is this something that we should think of as perhaps being 5 to 7 years in the making as far as $25 million, $50 million spend or is this something that once it's engineered and gets going we'll just have the spend all happening in 2016, 2017 for instance?","Robert C. Skaggs","The bulk of the spend would be back ended. We will be spending money for engineering, right-away work, that sort of thing, but the bulk of the dollars would in fact be in the time period you mentioned. Again, 100 miles, about $270 million is the total investment in the project.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On the Electric transmission project, you have MISO approval, you have FERC approval, what is the next milestone we should be looking for?","Robert C. Skaggs","I think that's about it in terms of what we would call regulatory milestones. Again, I mentioned we have a lot of work to do on the local front for permits, right of ways, engineering, that sort of thing, but the key regulatory steps have been taken.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of James Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Three questions if I can. First starting off on -- there we go. On the acreage, so the piece in addition to the 14,000 you've committed to the Hilcorp JV. I know some of that's still being sured up and understood. But as we think about that going forward, and understanding you'll have a lot more on this on the 12th, should we think about another process that would bring about potentially another JV like Hilcorp? Should we think about Hilcorp as sort of being in the driver's seat - that you'd sort of like to, though you're not contractually obligated to, commit acreage to another agreement with them? Just maybe add a little color around this for how we should be thinking about that going forward?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well I think going forward we think about our acreage in the western portion of the Utica, we hope that the structure that we've developed -- we think could be a model, could be a model, could be a template in terms of counter parties and direction and that sort of thing. Way, way, way too early to opine [ph] on that, Jay. And in fact, what I would go back to is, we've got to find out whether there is anything over there on the west that's commercial. That's step one. So we're continuing to watch very closely Devon and other folks that are reportedly drilling test wells in that portion of the world.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Switching then to the pipeline modernization just sort of harkening back to the last couple of calls. You historically have had sort of a balance, we're talking to our customers and if that fails, we'll file something at FERC. And I'm trying to probably parse your words more than you'd like me to, and respecting that you have NDAs in this process, but it sounds like you're a little more optimistic you're going to be able to get a settlement with customers. Is that a fair read of sort of the state of play understanding that we have no solution yet so there is no -- nothing guaranteed?","Robert C. Skaggs","The discussions have been constructive, ongoing, and stay tuned.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","But you wouldn't say that the absence -- because I think if I sort of listened carefully and I did, you didn't actually bring up the idea of just filing something at FERC and the absence of customer agreement?","Robert C. Skaggs","No, I just -- you're absolutely correct. I didn't mention that. That continues to be the option, the Plan B, if discussions with customers don't cross the finish line.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then lastly just on the earnings guidance, if I'm doing the math right, you're at about $1.42 trailing 12 months. So should we think of you sort of now sort of looking towards the higher end of guidance and sort of if not, what am I missing in the second half of this year that maybe isn't obvious?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well I think you've hit the nail on the head. We still have half of the year to go. And so we've got a lot of initiatives underway as we've noted. We're still in the midst of the summer season that can continue to bring storm -- storm restoration challenges. So at this point, I think the most prudent realistic view is we're between $1.40 and $1.50.","Operator","We do have another question from the line of Faisal Khan of Citigroup. I'm sorry, we're getting no response from Mr. Khan.","I will now hand back to Mr. Bob Skaggs for any closing remarks.","Robert C. Skaggs","All right. Deluj thank you so much, and again to everyone that's participated on the call, we appreciate your interest, your support. And to everyone, we look forward to seeing you on September 12, either in person or virtually. So thanks, have a good day. Appreciate your interest.

Welcome to NiSource First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. We will have a question-and-answer session later, and the instructions will follow at that time, and as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call to Mr. Randy Hulen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Randy Hulen - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the NiSource quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer.","The purpose of today's call is to review NiSource's financial performance for the first quarter of 2018 as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers, and financing plans. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. During this call, we will be referring to our supplemental earnings slides. These slides are available on nisource.com.","Before turning the call over to Joe and Donald, just a quick reminder. Some of the statements made during this conference call will be forward looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","In addition, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment information which includes our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.","With all that out of the way, I'd like to now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NiSource had a strong start to 2018 as our team continues to execute on our well-established plan that's creating value for our customers, communities, and investors. We're getting clarity on the regulatory implementation of federal tax reform, and we're on pace to deliver on the earnings, capital investment, and customer commitments we made for 2018. There's much to cover, so let's jump right in and look at slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments thus far in 2018.","We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $0.71 in 2017, which slightly exceeds Street expectations of about $0.76. This strong start to the year has NiSource on track to deliver per share net operating earnings within our $1.26 to $1.32 guidance range for 2018. We also remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our utility infrastructure in 2018.","Beyond the first quarter financial results, our teams are also executing on a robust regulatory agenda including reaching a settlement in our Indiana Gas base rate case as well as filing base rate cases in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the team executed on yet another year of modernization program tracker filings, which ensure continued timely recovery of infrastructure investments. Regulators also approved the long-term extension of our largest gas modernization program, which is in Ohio, and extensions of similar programs are pending in Indiana and Maryland.","In our electric business, we've initiated the latest Integrated Resource Plan process with stakeholders in Indiana, and we continue to execute on our long-term electric transmission and distribution system modernization program. Environmental upgrades are well under way at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations, and our two major transmission projects are nearly complete with expected in-service dates for later this year.","With respect to federal tax reform, the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are beginning to flow to our customers. We've used lower tax rates to help offset our revenue (00:04:41) increase request in the Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Massachusetts base rate cases as well as the annual tracker update in Ohio's gas infrastructure replacement program. And we're engaged with regulators and stakeholders across all our jurisdictions to manage and implement a balanced approach to providing these benefits to customers.","With this clarity emerging around the regulatory implementation of tax reform, we're able to effectively manage the cash impacts from these outcomes as well as through business initiatives and cash management. As you likely saw in a separate press release this morning, we've announced a common equity block offering of approximately $600 million. This offering completely resolves any credit and negative cash impacts of tax reform, and we have no plans for additional common equity block offerings through our planning horizon.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance and financing plan updates in more detail. Donald.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Moving on to our results in slide 4, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $260 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter compared with about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the same period of 2017. The biggest driver of our strong financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by solid regulatory outcomes and established infrastructure trackers.","Slide 5 demonstrates the effects of tax reform on our consolidated results. Our net revenues were down about $48 million, primarily due to regulatory revenue reserves as a result of lower tax rates set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This decline was offset by a decrease in the consolidated income taxes.","Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segment. Our gas distribution operations segment had operating earnings of about $320 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $362 million in the same period of 2017. As slide 6 depicts, operating earnings excluding the impact of the tax reform reserve, which is offset in consolidated income taxes, was a quarter-over-quarter increase of nearly $6 million.","Our electric operations segment covered on slide 7 reported operating earnings of about $86 million for the quarter, an increase of about $1 million from the same period of 2017. Once again, excluding the impact of the regulated revenue reserve for tax reform, the electric segment operating earnings increased by approximately $14 million over 2017. This increase was driven by higher revenues from infrastructure investment and lower operating expenses.","We're also making significant progress on flattening our operating and maintenance expenses, which has been an area of focus for us. Keeping our service affordable for our customers is a priority. And we've launched an internal effort to make process improvement and find efficiencies to better manage our expenses and enhance customer value.","Now, turning to slide 8, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9 billion, of which about $7.4 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity in our long-term debt was approximately 18 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower than in our 2015 separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long-term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $800 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. And on April 18, we added a very cost effective $600 million term loan that expires within 12 months to ensure ample liquidity through the time period for this equity offering and as we manage through the remaining cash impacts of tax reform.","I'd now like to turn to some additional details about our common equity block offering, which is covered on slides 9 and 10. As you may have seen already, this morning, we announced that we entered into an agreement to issue and sell nearly 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement to select institutional and accredited investors for net proceeds of approximately $600 million. This common equity block issuance is designed to completely resolve the cash impact of tax reform and puts us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. With this equity issuance, we currently have no planned additional common equity block issuance in 2018, 2019 or 2020.","Other annual equity news through 2020 are expected to remain consistent with our previous financing plan, which includes a range of $200 million to $300 million from an ATM program and $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. We expect to supplement these equity issuances with incremental debt, preferred equity or non-convertible subordinated long-term debt that provides equity content with the credit rating agencies.","As illustrated on slide 10, the recently completed equity transaction uplifts our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improving to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. This puts us back on the trajectory of strengthening our balance sheet to ensure access to low cost capital going forward.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe who will discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment, and regulatory highlights.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks for that update, Donald. Now, let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on slide 11. We filed a settlement agreement in our pending gas base rate case in Indiana. The proposal supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. And it incorporates the impact of tax reform, which reduces the original increase request. If approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million. An IURC order is expected in the second half of this year.","Also in Indiana, we filed an application to extend our gas modernization program. The filing represents approximately $1.25 billion of gas infrastructure investments through 2025. The well-established program allows for modernization of underground natural gas infrastructure and recovery of associated costs through a tracker. NIPSCO has invested more than $400 million in the previously approved programs since 2014. An IURC order on the new seven-year plan is expected in the second half of 2018. On February 27, NIPSCO also filed its latest tracker update, covering approximately $78 million of investments made in the second half of 2017 with expected recovery to begin in July.","In Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in March ,seeking to adjust rates to support continued system upgrades and replacement of underground natural gas distribution pipelines. The filing reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. If approved as filed, the request would allow for enhanced pipeline safety through a number of initiatives and would increase annual revenues by nearly $47 million. An order from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.","In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in January approved the five-year extension of our infrastructure replacement program. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. And just last week, the commission approved the annual tracker adjustment case, which allows us to begin recovery on approximately $207 million of infrastructure investments made in 2017. We've incorporated the impact of federal tax reform into this case, and it allows for a slight reduction in rates customers pay under this tracker.","Also in Ohio, our application for a capital expenditure program rider, which would allow us to begin recovering deferred capital investments made since 2011 that are not currently recovered under the existing infrastructure modernization tracker, remains pending with the commission. We're awaiting a procedural schedule in this case.","In Massachusetts, we filed a request with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, seeking authorization to increase base rates to recover operating costs associated with federal and state regulatory mandates and capital costs associated with upgrading our gas distribution infrastructure. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by about $24 million net of infrastructure trackers. A DPU decision is expected by February 28, 2019.","Also in Massachusetts, we received approval of our 2018 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Our annual application authorizes recovery of incremental 2018 capital investments of about $84 million, and new rates took effect on May 1. And in Maryland, we filed a base rate case with the Public Service Commission, seeking to adjust rates for distribution service so we can continue to replace aging gas pipeline and adopt pipeline safety upgrades. The proposal also reflects reduced corporate tax rate under the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. If approved as filed, the rate adjustments would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million. A PSC order is expected by the end of 2018.","Now, let's turn to our electric operations on slide 12. NIPSCO initiated its 2018 integrated resource plan process with the stakeholders meeting in March. Through this process, we are working constructively to develop a balanced plan to meet customers' long-term electric energy needs. Under the last IRP submitted in November 2016, we outlined the plan to retire 50% of our coal-fired generation fleet by the end of 2023 including Bailly Generating Station Units 7 and 8, which are expected to be retired on schedule this month.","The 2018 IRP, which is expected to be submitted to the IURC by the end of this year, will contain additional details on NIPSCO's long-term capacity plans. Investments in NIPSCO's Coal Combustion Residuals projects are well under way and expected to be completed by the end of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $193 million. These projects include environmental upgrades at Michigan City Unit 12 and R.M. Schaefer Units 14 and 15 generating facilities.","In December 2017, the IURC approved the settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs. We continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program in Indiana, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. The latest tracker update request filed on January 30, 2018 and covering approximately $75 million in investments made from May 2017 through November 2017 remains pending before the IURC.","Our two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule and are expected to be complete by mid-2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability.","As we wrap up, just some key takeaways about NiSource. I'm proud of the team's execution through these early months of 2018. The first few weeks of January were the coldest in our service footprint since the polar vortex years of 2014 and 2015 with sub-zero temperatures in some areas. We served new peak demand for gas in Massachusetts and in Virginia. Our strong winter preparation activities combined with our prudent capital investments ensured that our systems performed well for our customers.","I'm also proud of our team's work in resolving the impacts of tax reform in a way that maintains all of our financial commitments and enhances the sustainability of our plan going forward due to the savings our customers will enjoy. If you'd like even more detail about our sustainability focus, I encourage you to check out our second integrated annual report, which we published last month and is available at nisource.com.","NiSource continues to create value across a set of operational, social, and financial performance factors, and we're more confident than ever that our well-established customer-focused business strategy is sustainable for many years to come.","For 2018, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.26 to $1.32 per share and to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments. We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now, let's open the call up to your questions. Carmen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Congratulations on a solid quarter and your continued regulatory traction. Just had a couple questions. The IRP, is there a chance that we could see some more retirements announced?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Everything is on the table in the IRP just inherently in the way we look at it. I don't know that we'd see more retirements announced, but we revisit the timing of all of the capacity planning, both retirements and new capacity as we look at that profile. So, watch that space across the year. We are putting information on the NIPSCO website that is part of the stakeholder engagement and that will show the full range of scenarios that we're evaluating and discussing with our stakeholders.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just a clarification, when you talk about flattening O&M, is that untracked O&M or is that the absolute O&M line?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","When we say that we refer to the untracked O&M, the tracked O&M can move about in time, but we're really actively manage the non-tracked O&M.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then do you have a sense of how many investors were in the private placement group?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yes, the transaction is complete, and there were six investors participated.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Paul. Thanks for the call.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Congratulations. So, perhaps first question here, can you clarify just as you think about your 5% to 7% in the long-term trajectory here, how you might mitigate some of the sort of transient factors, the incremental dilution from the private placement on 2019 and the back half of 2018 specifically? Obviously, you have some various moving factors on the rate case as well. To what extent is cost management going to try to address some of these timing issues, if you will?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Julien, for the question. So, we think about our earnings and I think what we've tried to consistently say is regulatory outcome is typically the biggest, has the biggest impact on our earnings year to year, and then it's financing, and then it's O&M. And so, when you think about our earnings this year and going forward, it's all of those levers that we're looking at. In terms of what the outcomes and timing of those regulatory outcomes within the mix, certainly O&M has been a focus of ours here this last year, and you can see it in our results even in the first quarter around flat O&M. So, that is a lever that we are managing to make sure that we're meeting our commitments around reliability and safety and service but at the same time, where there is opportunities to manage our expenses to hit our earnings that is also a lever that we will and have pulled in the past.","And then obviously, around the financing plan, we thought it was good to get out here early on the equity, certainly thought that there was a little overhang in our stock because of the tax reform and the impact on our cash flows. We had significant interest from investors who were anticipating the need for equity, and so we had some calls from some of our largest investors to issue equity, so we thought it was just really good once we had the clarity around our regulatory programs, the timing of the passback of the tax savings as well as the capabilities of our O&M program and those levers to go out now and get that done for the year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. But just to clarify, it sounds like you guys have been anticipating the equity raise the middle part of this year, and you wouldn't necessarily expect any kind of real deviation from your historic earnings growth track record even to this very short-term period here as you suggest (00:25:36), right?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","No. No. That's right. Yeah, we've always said it is \u2013 we think that through our programs, we've got the ability to hit the high end of that range, and this does not change that our expectations on our capabilities to hit that high end of the range.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And similarly, I didn't hear it in the call per se, but with respect to the tax reform outcome you did achieve recently in the settlement, this isn't necessarily materially different from what you were kind of earlier expecting for 2018 cash flows from an FFO to debt perspective.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Are you referring to the NIPSCO settlement?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, exactly. I'll let you respond.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. No, absolutely. Actually, it was a very favorable outcome in terms of the passback of the excess deferred taxes, that doesn't start until 2020. And so, that was a positive upside for us from a cash flow perspective. I think as you look at the other rate cases that we filed in Pennsylvania and in Massachusetts, in Maryland, and we've gotten orders to pass back those savings upon the rates going effect on those base rate cases. And so, we've had some positive timing around both the rate cases, the NIPSCO settlement as well as the rate cases that we filed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. Fair enough. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Very clear and frankly, the majority of my questions have been answered. On page 9, you have TBD in the columns for non-convertible subordinated debt or preferred equity. You said that you're sort of completely done with the common equity portion of the tax offset program. But is the implication here that there's just a tad more work to do on the credit metrics just to nudge them into the range and that you'll get there through sort of those \u2013 on the margin through those activities?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. I think, we really look at the non-convertible debt or preferred equity as having some flexibility to make sure we're in the range, do it in a way that provides flexibility versus doing common equity including the ATM program, and so looking at really what's the all-in cost of doing those type of securities versus equity or debt and since you get equity content on those securities, really trying to understand what the value is there. So, that's (00:28:43).","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. And then you're still confident when you restack everything with the \u2013 just to ask Julien's question a little bit more succinctly, net of the dilution from higher share count or preferred or debt costs, you still feel pretty comfortable that you have levers to pull to be at the high end of the 5% to 7% earnings guidance range on average over time.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Absolutely. Again, the regulatory outcomes typically are the biggest driver, and that hasn't changed. Our strategy hasn't changed, and those programs haven't changed. And so, we're confident that we can hit the top end of the range.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Take care.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. This is Mike Weinstein.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. A quick question for you. What other cash flow measures do you think you need to accomplish now that you have settlements or outcomes in Indiana and Ohio in order to mitigate the impact of the tax reform?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","We're looking at everything. Obviously, FFO matters for us. And so, we're looking at all of our regulatory programs, and we're staying in touch with our teams there that are managing those rate cases. Otherwise, O&M is probably the next biggest driver around FFO, and it's something that we're obviously managing pretty closely.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, at this point, it's really more about O&M than it is about getting additional regulatory, I guess, settlements, right, in terms of improving cash flow.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. If you think about the timing of those rate cases, potentially, you have settlements in Q4, Q3 or Q4. Any cash from those I would absolutely take. But they are going to be less material than our overall O&M program.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Most of my questions have been answered as well, but I wanted to ask on the private placement. Is that a kind of straight common issuance here where it will dilute you right away or is there any forward component of that?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","No, it is a straight common issuance. There is no forward component.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then when we look at your $200 million to $300 million per year plan of internal and ATM equity issuance, you're pretty well into that through the first quarter already. Can we think about you kind of hitting the top end of that range both this year and next year? And then, I guess, kind of the same question for you on the CapEx numbers for the next two to three years within the range.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Again, so, on the ATM program, as you see on that slide, we've done $170 million already. We did a forward contract in Q4 for about $170 million, and so we will execute that this year. We'll look at it and, I think, the reason I like that ATM program is it does provide the flexibility around the financing needs in hitting our metrics. I think it's too early to say if we would use more than the $170 million this year or next year. I think it's just too early, but it gives us that flexibility to make sure that we're above the 13% by the end of this year. And next year, we'll see kind of where we are, but it will be in that range. And again...","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","And again, part of that comes out of our regulatory outcomes that in terms of the base rate cases, in particular around where cash flows are and the passback of those excess deferred taxes, that will push it to the lower end or the higher end of that range, of the $200 million to $300 million.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on the CapEx side, are you guys kind of coming into these years with a assumption that you need to be at the lower end of the CapEx ranges to have that kind of balance sheet flexibility or room to make those expenditures?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","No, not at all. I think our range is pretty tight at this point. We don't expect that to change. And if you think about the CapEx and impact on FFO, it has a much smaller impact than our regulatory programs or O&M programs.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. A couple of questions actually, a little bit of housekeeping stuff. First, can you remind us what kind or what level of a cash taxpayer you are in 2018 and then kind of going forward, meaning NOL balances and potential offsets to cash taxes?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. So, we continue to have NOLs and even with the tax reform act, we will not be cash taxpayer, and our NOL will expire until about 2026.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","So, over the next few years, we still won't be a cash taxpayer.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So, long-term sizable NOL benefit, that's a source of cash. So, as earnings grow, that kind of source of cash rises a little bit in lockstep with earnings growth.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That's correct.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Second, in the NIPSCO Gas settlement, I want to make sure I understand that. First of all, is that all a one-year uplift in revenue or is that spread out, that $107 million, spread out over a couple of years? And does all that drop to the bottom line after tax or is there a higher D&A rate coming or is there a higher tracked O&M coming that \u2013 or even untracked O&M that might offset that?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yes, so there is actually three steps in that rate case settlement, starting it in October this year at $86.5 million annualized, and then it rises to $107 million by 2020. A big component of that rate case was depreciation. It was about $63 million of depreciation. And so, if you net that $107 million and the $63 million, that's really your earnings or margin pickup. There is no O&M component additional to that. That was really already baked into our historic results and current year plan.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. So, in other words, the $63 million of D&A, that's not D&A you booked or you showed on your income statements in 2017. That's a higher D&A rate or a higher D&A amount that will kick when the new rates go into effect.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yes, that is correct. Absolutely.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then last thing, just thinking about the NIPSCO Gas investment program, the $1.25 billion over, I think, it's seven years, can you remind us, is that an uptick from the last gas investment program?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah, it was about $800 million previously.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated and congrats on a good quarter.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Carrie Saint Louis with Fidelity.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Hi. Good morning.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Carrie.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Thanks so much for being proactive with the new funding plan and the equity issuance. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about your financing. So, the expectation and I think I see this on slide 9 is that this year, if I add up all the sources of equity, it should be closer to about a $1 billion?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Well, so there's $600 million. We've already done \u2013 we did $600 million as of yesterday plus the $170 million, so we're at $770 million ...","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Yeah.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","...for the year, but with, we'll look at again through the balance of the year whether we tap more into the ATM program.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","But you're looking at an additional $130 million or so that...","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. And then the other benefit programs on top of that?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That's correct.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. And then the latter two programs continue on an annual basis in that $200 million to $300 million and $35 million to $60 million range.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That's correct.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. And then when I'm looking at your incremental long-term debt, the zero to $300 million for 2018, I don't see any maturities on right now on Bloomberg, but I forget if you've had some in the first part of the year. So, the total debt issuance for the year, could you just remind me what that number is going to look like?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","It will be in the range \u2013 again, we're looking at both long-term debt as well as the non-convertible subordinated debt to see what's the best value for us to help finance the balance of this year, so it would be somewhere in that range. But this equity block as well as the ATM already helped finance a lot of this year.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. But I guess, what I'm saying is that's new debt, so it doesn't include the refinancing, but you're saying that's going to be $300 million of either debt or I'm assuming what you're suggesting is hybrids.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That's correct. That's correct.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","We had a maturity in Q1 of about $200 million, a little over $200 million.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. So, then the amount might be $500 million if I include that in there?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yes.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. That's what I was kind of getting at. And then just can you walk through your use of commercial paper? So, the $1 billion, it looks like you had about $1 billion of CP issued. Is that a level you're comfortable with, knowing that short-term rates have risen quickly, like what's your current ongoing thesis about using short-term debt? And is there any ability to try to get the Fitch rating up from an F3?","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Carrie. This is Shawn Anderson. Great question and I appreciate that. That is a question we've been discussing with Fitch, and we will continue to have that conversation. So, more to come on that hopefully this year. And in terms of use of commercial paper, that $1 billion mark is a pretty good bogey for us on a month-by-month basis. The term loan that we agreed into in April will actually provide a little bit of flexibility for us to toggle between the two. But when you think of those together, that $1 billion mark is pretty close to what you expect us to be at.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. Again, that term loan, so is it fully drawn at this point?","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","It is not. It has a delayed draw feature. We drew $150 million at close, which we in turn paid down commercial paper, and then have the balance, $450 million, that we have at our discretion over the next 364 days.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. Yeah. So, 364 days is our option to extend or it's just a hard maturity.","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","Hard maturity.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. Great.","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","And again, we would think of those almost the same as the commercial paper program itself. The rates are almost identical to what we were getting in the market. In fact, we had some favorability at some point throughout the rise in the interest rate environment.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Great. And again, going back to \u2013 I appreciate \u2013 again, I should thank you very much for the slides. I appreciate the color on the FFO levels and your FFO to debt target. So, obviously, coming in and proactively issuing this equity suggests that you are committed to kind of defending these current ratings, mid and high BBB credit quality, even if unexpected kind of things arise like tax reform. Is that kind of the thinking that I should have going forward?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That's right. I think last quarter, we were pretty explicit that we were anticipating and expecting to maintain these ratings, and we were going to do what was possible, anything possible to maintain these current ratings.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","And so, let me just ask the last question on is it the more the rating or the numbers that you are focused on like hopefully, you get \u2013 I mean, the 15% would really be a good strong number, I think, to kind of be in that category? Is that where you're kind of more gearing yourself towards?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah, from discussions with the agencies, they want us to be in that 14% to 15% range for our current ratings, and that's what we're targeting with our financing plans.","Carrie Saint Louis - Fidelity Management & Research Co.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Carrie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Just curious, any kind of high-level strategic takeaway from the Vectren transaction that recently got announced?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Good morning. I won't comment or speculate on market activity, Vectren or otherwise. We've had and we'll continue to have a disciplined approach to growing shareholder value, and that's really evidenced by our long-term capital investment programs and the sustained growth outlook that we're reiterating here today, and the current focus remains on those programs and the $30 billion of identified investments that we're executing on.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just following Carrie's question, just from a rating agency standpoint, they affirm kind of with the statement that you would essentially take any actions to fill in the gap, so to speak, from tax reform. And so, are you very comfortable that this is sufficient for what they had expected from you?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","No, I am \u2013 we've had regular consistent conversations with the agencies about our plan this year, our financing plan and understanding their expectations for the metrics that they want us to hit. I think that was evident with us staying off the Moody's negative watch list, that they were comfortable with our plan. Shawn had conversations with the agencies last week as well as yesterday to update them on the equity transaction. So, I think we're right on where we want to be and are hitting their expectations.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Hey, Joe. How are you?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Just have two quick follow-ups hopefully. First and I don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but, Donald, just curious, on the ATM, I see, obviously, on slide 9, you referenced the $170 million. I just want to be clear about that though. You have yet to receive that cash or issue those shares, right?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","That is correct. It was a forward contract, and we have not received that cash yet.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And because it's forward because you went out and borrowed and sort of did that on a forward agreement, do those get the dividends in the interim? Do you have to double cover?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yes, they do. They do repeat the dividends.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. And then finally, with the placement, I guess, it was yesterday, so that placement missed this quarter's dividend. Is that correct or were those...","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Of course.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Really appreciate the time.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thanks. Hey. Good job on slide 6 and 7, showing the impact of tax reform on each of the segments. I like that. Was there an implied ROE on the recent NIPSCO Gas base rate case?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","9.85%, Charles.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then just one other regulatory question in Ohio. You've gone almost six months now and without getting a procedural schedule on the recovery of the non-IRP tracker investments. I also noticed the request is almost doubled. I assume that's just because of the delay. Is there pushback on that or why is it taking so long just to get a procedural schedule?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","No pushback. I wouldn't raise that concern. It's really a new, novel, if you will, approach to recovering those deferred investments. The commission has now requested an assignment of an auditor to look at the underlying costs, and so there's progress on it. If not a procedural schedule, there's progress there. We still remain confident in resolution of that filing late this year.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","And the revenue that's doubling, that's just because of the delay?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","That's just annualizing the number.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Got it. That's all I have. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Andy.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Glad you got the equity done. So, just to make sure I got my share count right based on kind of Carrie's questions, answers, and kind of what you've done already, so I guess, we're adding about \u2013 if we take last year's year-end number, about 50 million shares, give or take 1 million or 2 million shares. Is that kind of how to think about it?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","No, the equity issuance we completed yesterday was 25 million shares.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","No. No. No. What I was saying, at the end of the year, based on what you're going to do at the money, the $170 million that still has to be drawn, et cetera, et cetera, by the end of 2018, it will be about 50 million additional shares? And then...","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say it's probably closer to 35 million share, so we...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Can you walk us through that then because...","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah, so through the ATM...","(00:48:58)","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Not average shares. I'm not talking about average shares. I'm talking about actual shares. Maybe I'm wrong. If you can just walk us through that, that would be great. I want to get that right. It's important.","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning. This is Shawn. So, the private placement that was discussed that commenced yesterday is approximately 25 million shares.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay.","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","The $170 million that's cited as part of the at the market program has an aggregate of 6.3 million shares.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. So...","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","Right just north of that 30 million share mark.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay.","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","Obviously, the stock price had a different value during that forward construct.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay.","Shawn Anderson - NiSource, Inc.","... where it was to-date. So, that helped pick up some of the difference that you might be accounting for there. And then to Donald's point, at maximum, would be potentially another $130 million. Those obviously haven't been priced and haven't been contemplated. So, that would be where your bogey would be beyond that.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. So, it's like $31 million plus the $130 million divided, I don't know, we'll use 24 for a better way, hopefully, it's better price. So, that's $36 million, okay? And then that's all, whether it's at the money, forward that you've already done, the shares that you issued, it's 36 million shares, and that totals how much money? Just...","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Well, the money...","(00:50:25)","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","$600 million plus the $170 million, plus another $130 million is $900 million. Okay. That's good.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","That would be the maximum. Correct.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Perfect. Got it. Okay. I'm slow yet I understand that. I do old math relative to my kids who do new math. Okay. So, that's $900 million. I didn't get a laugh out of you there. I guess, your kids aren't as young as mine. Okay. So, that's $900 million. And then next year, it's incremental $200 million to $300 million every year how much of that 10 million shares or something like that depending on the stock price. Maybe it's less.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Depending on the stock price, that's correct. The $200 million to $300 million would be the total, that's correct.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. Great. And then the last question I have just relates to your growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2020. Do you guys plan to have an Analyst Day at some point now since the equity is done or just in general, when do we get a refresh beyond 2020 on the growth rate?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Andy, this is Joe. Thanks for that question. We're likely going to place that late this year, early next year. By all stretch of the imagination, by this time next year, we would have an update on that. The primary driver there wasn't so much tax reform in the equity, but our CapEx outlook beyond 2020. As you know, the programs that characterize the bulk of our capital are programmatic, stretch well beyond 2020, great visibility there. The part of the capital program that's less clear today is on the electric generation side of the business. As we go through the integrated resource plan this year, we'll refresh that picture, which is more about capacity replacement than the retirement picture that we updated last time. And so, as we formulate that strategy, that will give us the same kind of confidence for CapEx beyond 2020 that we have through 2020 today. So, look for that late this year, more likely early next year based on how the planning looks at this time.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And then I actually lied. I do have one more question. I mean, I can kind of do the math. I've told you I'm not very good at it, but I can do math. But can you tell us what price the private placement was priced at or is that not possible?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","The private placement priced off of last night's close at a 1% discount.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","1% discount. Got it. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Yeah. You're welcome.","Operator","And thank you.

Hulen - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer.","The purpose of today's call is to review NiSource's financial performance for the first quarter of 2017, as well as provide an update on our utility operations and growth drivers. We'll then open the call up to your questions.","As a reminder, we will be referring to our supplemental earnings slides during this call. These slides are available on our website. Also available on our website is the document that contains segment and financial information to accompanying this presentation.","Before turning the call over to Joe, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","In addition, some of the statements made on this conference call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment and financial information available on nisource.com.","With all that out of the way, the call is now yours, Joe.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Randy. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. NiSource started 2017 with strong first quarter financial and operational results. I'm proud of our talented and dedicated teams across NiSource for delivering sustained value for our customers, community, and investors. The long-term modernization programs underway in each of our states provide clear and compelling investment opportunities, which our teams are effectively executing.","Let's look at slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlights some of our significant achievements thus far in 2017. We delivered net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.71 compared to $0.62 during the same period in 2016. We're on plan to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure across our seven states this year. These financial results and investment levels have NiSource on track to deliver non-GAAP annual net operating earnings in the upper half of the company's 2017 guidance range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.","Today, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market or ATM equity issuance program. The ATM, combined with future debt offerings and our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's utility capital investments. Consistent with what we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, we continue to expect to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend at 5% to 7% annually through 2020.","We also expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure programs from 2018 through 2020. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs across all seven of our states. The early 2017 highlights include regulatory approval of our base rate case settlement in Virginia, filling of a base rate case in Maryland, approvals of tracker updates for gas infrastructure programs in Massachusetts and Ohio, filling of a long-term infrastructure replacement plan update in Ohio, and continued electric transmission, distribution and environmental investments in Indiana.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned earlier, it certainly was a strong start to the year. And we are now guiding to the upper half of our non-GAAP 2017 net operating earnings range of $1.12 to $1.18 per share.","Now, turning to slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the first quarter, compared with about $198 million or $0.62 per share for the same period in 2016. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $447 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $48 million over the same period in 2016.","On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $417 million for the quarter versus about $381 million in the first quarter of 2016. Biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments.","Let's now take a closer look at our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $364 million in the quarter, an increase of about $34 million compared with the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $63 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement program. This increased gas revenue was partially offset by an approximately $29 million increase in operating expenses related to increased O&M, depreciation expense, and property taxes.","Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $12 million from the first quarter of 2016. Once again, excluding the impact of trackers, net revenues were up about $24 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case and increased capital spending on the transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by increased operating expenses of approximately $12 million, primarily due to increased O&M, a portion of which is related to items formerly tracked or deferred that were rolled into base rate as a result of the rate case. Full details of our first quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.","Now, turning to slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $789 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility.","It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the three major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+; Moody's at Baa2; and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.","I'd also like to highlight that we filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC earlier this morning. This is consistent with the approach we outlined at our Investor Day in March, and is part of our balanced, predictable approach to financing our infrastructure investment programs. Keep in mind that all of our financing costs are included in our updated 2017 earnings guidance and the long-term earnings and dividend annual growth rates of 5% to 7% through 2020.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment, and regulatory highlights.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight a recognition we received that we're quite proud of. In March, the Ethisphere Institute named NiSource to its list of the world's most ethical companies for the sixth consecutive year. This designation supports our stakeholder commitments and is influenced by our employees' actions and the systems and processes we have in place. Our commitment to doing the right thing crosses every aspect of our day-to-day business interactions, ensuring we serve our customers with fairness, honesty, integrity, and trust day in and day out.","And I would also like to encourage you to read our 2016 Integrated Annual Report which was published in April. For the first time, we combined our Annual Report to Stockholders and our Corporate Sustainability Report into a single publication. We did this to further illustrate how we've integrated our operational, financial, and social performance across our business strategy. In addition to our financial performance, the report focuses on other sustainability issues which are important to our stakeholders.","Across both our gas and electric business segments, we're continuing to execute on our customer focused infrastructure modernization investments. Together with regulatory initiatives and enhanced customer programs, these investments are helping to improve system safety and reliability, customer service and response, and our system's environmental performance.","Now, let's turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter from our gas operations on slide 6. We continue to make progress on our regulatory initiatives across all states. On the rate case front, we received approval of our settlement in Virginia and also filed a new case in Maryland. The Virginia order received in March, related to our 2016 base rate case, it allows for about a $29 million annual revenue increase and supports our continued investments related to safety, reliability, and system growth. Maryland's request filed last month supports continued replacement of aging pipe and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades. If approved, just filed, the Maryland base rate adjustment would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6 million.","Our teams also continue to execute on our gas infrastructure replacement programs and make progress on tracker updates. Just last week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts received regulatory approval of its 2017 Gas System Enhancement Plan which includes about $69 million of investments this year. In Indiana, we filed our semi-annual tracker update in late February, covering approximately $61 million of investments made in the second half of 2016.","And in Ohio, we received an order on April 26 on our annual infrastructure replacement program rider adjustment, covering $235 million of investments made in 2016. Also, in Ohio, we filed for authority to continue our Infrastructure Replacement Program through the end of 2022. This well-established pipeline replacement program covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe, and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines.","Now, let's turn to our Electric Operations on slide 7. In our electric business, we've continued to focus on investments which enhance safety, service reliability, environmental performance, and customer service as well as regulatory initiatives to support those investments. These include plans for environmental upgrades at certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. These investments, estimated at $400 million, are designed to reduce our impact on local waterways as well as coal ash emissions from these units and keep our fleet in compliance with federal regulations.","We're also focused on executing our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure, designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. And we began recovering on approximately $46 million of these investments effective in February of 2017.","Our two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.","So, as we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful regulatory outcomes in recent years support our high-value customer programs, things like pipeline and wire replacement, leak repair, enhanced line locating and capabilities, vegetation management and electric generation investments. These investments are leading to positive customer outcomes with respect to safety, reliability, and environmental performance of our systems.","We expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings at the upper end of our $1.12 to $1.18 per share guidance range, with about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments. And we continue to expect to invest $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually in our utility infrastructure from 2018 through 2020, and remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities.","With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Now, let's open the call to your questions. Brian?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Sir, your line is now open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Paul. Thank you very much.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just a clarification on the ATM. The $500 million, the tenure of the ATM is two years. So, it's basically in line with the $200 million to $300 million you talked about at Analyst Day, is that the right way to think about it?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Paul, understanding that we're limited in what we can say about the ATM program and noting that all of the details about the program are in the prospectus supplement, the supplement filed today is consistent with the financing plan we outlined on Investor Day, calling for $200 million to $300 million of ATM equity each year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then how should we think about the base going forward for your 5% to 7% earnings growth? Should we still be thinking about the midpoint of original guidance or kind of the midpoint of the upper half at this point? I know it's kind of splitting hairs, but just kind of want to get your views on it.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Hi, Paul. This is Donald. I'll take this. What we did outline in March was 5% to 7% annual earnings and dividend growth. So, I would certainly take the midpoint of kind of your expectation for our updated guidance and use the 5% to 7% annual growth off of that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. It clears that up. And you had a tailwind from some debt refinancings, that we've lapped that at this point, haven't we?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","I'm sorry. Could you ask that again, Paul?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You had a little bit of a tailwind in the first quarter from some debt refinancings, but we've lapped that at this point, is that correct?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yes. So, we had some maturities over the last quarter, but no refinancings in the last year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Let me ask you, I mean, you did \u2013 on the CapEx that you highlighted at the Analyst Day, the capital of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion through 2020. It seems like you've got the O&M levers, rates remain relatively low. You've got the subsidy from gas. Is there an opportunity to accelerate some of that $30 billion-plus that you've identified in the Analyst Day pull forward, or sort of should we be thinking about the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion somewhere around the midpoint?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah, you should stick to the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, keeping in mind, that is accelerated from where we had been for the past couple years. We've been steadily building to that level over the past couple years, and that's our new expected run rate for the planning horizon that we outlined at Investor Day, and feel very comfortable about executing in that range.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, just lastly on the update to the infrastructure program in Ohio, is there another data point or we're just at a waiting point?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","There is no update to that. We're pending before the commission, we'd expect an order later this year. I would say that the plan we propose is consistent with the CapEx plan that we laid out on Investor Day as well.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Excellent. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Shahriar. Appreciate that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Donald, if I could just ask for some clarification or maybe I just misunderstood this, I thought on \u2013 I thought you said that electric revenues benefited from the two transmission projects under construction and I \u2013 do you have a tracker that automatic \u2013 that goes to rates? Or I thought that was just a deferral on those until they are in operation.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","There is a tracker on our environmental spend in Indiana, and so we're receiving increased revenues as we spend on those programs.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","But on the two transmissions projects, is that where I misunderstood, you were talking about the environmental?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","I'd say on both, at environmental spend as well as on our transmission projects, we do earn as we're spending.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","But it also goes into revenue as well on the transmission? Or I mean, I know you earn on it as you told it.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yes. That's correct.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. That resolves that. That's the only question I had. Thank you.","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","All righty. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to probe a little bit at both the gas and the electric side on O&M. And the only reason why is I'm looking at the detailed supplemental financials you provide, and I recognized that \u2013 and I love your disclosure because you break out. You're one of the only guys who does this, by the way, who breaks out what O&M or D&A were covered via trackers and what is just kind of true core O&M, that is unbelievably helpful. But if I look at true core O&M, and let's start with the gas side. Going from $200 million to $223 million. And then, on the electric side, going from $109.5 million to almost $124.5 million. Percentage wise, those are really big increases. And just curious, if they're not covered via trackers, how much of that is creating lag for NiSource? And how much of that is already kind of embedded in forward-looking rates?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, let me take a first crack at that and ask Donald to add some detail. You kind of hit on one of the key themes, the first thing I'd say, the O&M you're seeing in this quarter reflects our expected annual run rate fully ramped up now to the capabilities and investments that we set forth as we walked through the separation a couple years ago and it does reflect a shift of formerly tracked or deferred items that we rode in through the base rate case cycle we've been through over the past year, year and a half. So, you're seeing some of that geography shift as well. And inside those cases reflects commitments to some increased programs that we laid out in the various base rate cases, reliability, tree trimming programs, those kinds of things. So, I would characterize it not as indicative of expected ongoing growth, but a step that reflects our commitment to this level of spending and this level of customer value. That said, we expect it to flatten off here as we go forward and level off a bit as we go forward, and we did outline that at Investor Day. Anything you want to add to that Donald?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","No. I think you've said most of it. The key really is, if you think about last year being in five base rate cases, and many of those rate cases having forward test years or some portion of their rates having some forward looks to them, and so our O&M that's in our numbers and consistent with our plan are really embedded in much of our rates this year. Having said that, during our March Analyst Day, we talked about our transformation program that we've really started last year and have kicked off this year. That is not in rates built into our rate program, and so there is some lag to those. But we expect that those dollars that we're spending and investing in that program will ultimately lead to us being able to level off our total O&M spending and have flatter expenses after 2017.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And if I were to just look back at 2016 and then look at your 2017 guidance, if you had to think about what's your earned return on rate base is, what was 2016 just kind of a system wide average? And what does your guidance imply for 2017?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","So, I'd say \u2013 no, from an ROE standpoint, we are typically earning close to our authorized rates of return which are \u2013 we've got them posted in our materials, they range from 9.5% to 10% ROE. So, with our tracker programs and about 70% to 75% of our capital rolling through those tracker programs, we're able to stay pretty close to our overall authorized rates \u2013 returns on equity.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Liou from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Can you just expand a little bit on your decision to merge NiSource FinCo, Capital Markets, and also kind of change the structure you will be issuing debt out of?","Donald E. Brown - NiSource, Inc.","Yes, certainly. And this is Donald again. So, the merger of NiSource Finance with NiSource, Inc really is a cleanup of our legal entity structures and will allow us to really just simplify our overall structure. Over the past, as you know, NiSource, Inc has guaranteed all of the debt of NiSource Finance. And so, as we look at just the overall strategy, it just makes sense to bring them together since NiSource, Inc was already on the hook for that debt in the first place. So, we do need to go through the approvals. We've got a couple states that we'll require to go through a regulatory process to get approval to merge these. But assuming we do get that approval, we would then merge NiSource Finance into NiSource, Inc and issue all future debt out of NiSource, Inc.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess just when it comes to the intercompany notes when you can borrow from the holding company and then you kind of inject it down to the opco, would you classify those as kind of promissory notes, like, is there a written agreement between the two? Or is it just more general in that?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","They are promissory notes, absolutely. They are legal promissory notes.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Sir, your line is now open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I noticed you broke out customer growth at the gas companies. Kind of how is that trending and kind of what's the trajectory for your initiatives to a kind of that \u2013 the customer growth are you seeing?","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Yeah. Paul, thanks for asking that. We are on track, maybe a little bit ahead of plan, so far, this year in terms of the outlook that we shared on Investor Day, which was steady climb to a net 1% per year growth by 2020. So, we're well in line with that plan, and had favorable conditions in the first quarter as well for construction, which I think helped us to stay on or a bit ahead of track there.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That helps. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And I am showing no further questions, and I would like to turn the call back to Joe Hamrock, CEO, for any further remarks.","Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. And thanks to all of you for your ongoing interest and your support of NiSource. Again, we appreciate your engagement and the opportunity to talk with you. Have a great day and a safe day. Take care.

And now I'd like to hand over to Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please go ahead.","Glen L. Kettering","Thank you, and good morning. On behalf of NiSource, I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining us this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations. As you know, the focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the third quarter of 2012 and to provide a business update. We'll then open the call to your questions.","At times during the call, we'll refer to the supplemental slides available on nisource.com. I'd like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Glen, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before diving into the details of NiSource's third quarter, we want to take a moment to extend our thoughts and sympathies to everyone affected by Hurricane Sandy. Our teams were on high alert during the storm, and aside from some minor disruptions, our operations and team members fared well. In fact, there are no major issues with our facilities to report. A big thank you to all of our teams for their focus on safety and to the emergency workers and first responders that braved the storm and are involved in the ongoing recovery efforts. And a special thank you to our crews from NIPSCO and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts that have mobilized to assist with the restoration efforts. And thank you to our financial stakeholders for understanding our decision to reschedule our earnings announcement from Tuesday to this morning.","Now to the business at hand. Our agenda today is focused and straightforward with plenty of time for questions. We'll first touch on financial highlights from yet another strong quarter. As you'll see, our earnings continue to be on track with our 2012 outlook. We'll also cover the strong progress we've made across each of our business units, which demonstrates our team's continued execution on NiSource's well-established infrastructure, investment-driven growth strategy. And finally, we'll field your questions.","Let's start with a few key takeaways, which you'll find on Slide 3 of the supplemental deck posted online this morning. If there's one theme for the quarter, and the year, for that matter, it's strong progress. Strong progress on our business plan and financial results, strong progress across each of our business units and strong progress on a robust capital investment program.","As noted in this morning's release, NiSource's earnings are squarely in line with our 2002 -- 2012 guidance of $1.40 to $1.50 per share non-GAAP. Notably, our Gas Transmission and Storage team filed a comprehensive, near-unanimous customer settlement in support of its groundbreaking -- excuse the pun -- infrastructure modernization program. We also advanced our midstream and minerals game plan by virtue of a couple strategic arrangements with Hilcorp Energy in the heart of the liquids-rich Utica Shale play.","In addition, we continue to execute on a broad array of utility infrastructure modernization and environmental investments across our markets. These investments are the foundation of our discipline, infrastructure-focused business strategy and drive sustainable earnings quarter-after-quarter, all the while delivering value for our customers, communities and other key stakeholders.","For 2012, we expect these infrastructure investments to exceed $1.5 billion. And most of you who attended virtually or in person our September Investor Day know that we have an extremely deep inventory of value-adding infrastructure investment opportunities spanning the next 20-plus years and totaling $25 billion to $30 billion.","On an annual basis, that opportunity will translate into a capital investment run rate of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. And last, but certainly not least, we have the financial foundation and demonstrated discipline to support this enhanced investment strategy.","So with that backdrop, let's take a closer look at our third quarter results, starting with our financial progress on Slide 4. As you can see, NiSource delivered net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of almost $16 million, or $0.05 per share, for the 3 months ended September. That compares with about $33 million, or $0.11 per share, for the third quarter of 2011. Our operating earnings for the quarter decreased from about $142 million to approximately $130 million. It's important to note that these results reflect approximately $50 million in previously disclosed and anticipated costs associated with our pipeline modernization customer settlement. Again, even with this expense, we remain on track to deliver on our financial commitments for 2012.","On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations for the quarter was about $20 million compared to about $36 million in 2011. Schedules 1 and 2 to our earnings release showed the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items.","Let's turn now to our individual business unit results, starting first with the strong progress we've made at NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage or NGT&S highlighted on Slide 5. As I mentioned, the highlights of the quarter is the comprehensive and, I might add, unprecedented customer settlement filed with the FERC in early September. The settlement represents a key step forward in support of our pipeline modernization initiative, a long-term program that ultimately is expected to involve roughly $4 billion in investment to enhance the safety, reliability and flexibility of our Columbia Gas Transmission system. The agreement has an initial 5-year term covering investments placed into service during the 2013 through 2017 timeframe, with provisions for potential extensions.","It provides an adjustment to base rates and a predictable annual cost recovery mechanism for our projected $300 million annual investment. Notably, the settlement is now ripe for action by the FERC, and the parties have asked the commission to grant its approval prior to December 1.","Moving on. NGT&S's core operating earnings continued to be solid and benefited from a number of growth projects placed in service since last year, as well as the Columbia Gulf rate case, which was settled in November of 2011. Our NGT&S team also continues to develop and execute on infrastructure investment opportunities in existing and new markets, as well as midstream projects to serve the Utica and Marcellus Shale regions. Specifically, during the quarter, Millennium Pipeline received FERC approval to add more than 12,000 horsepower of compression in Orange County, New York. We'll fund nearly half of that partnership investment of about $43 million. Construction has started on the project with the targeted in-service date in the first quarter of 2013.","We're also moving ahead on a couple of other significant projects that will help provide market access for new shale gas production. Our $200 million West Side Expansion project has binding precedent agreements in place and is on track for an FERC filing in the first half of 2013. That project is set for in-service in late 2014. And just last week, we announced that we have binding precedent agreements with customers of East Side Expansion project. That approximately $200 million project will add up to 300,000 dekatherms per day of capacity to meet increasing demand by moving Marcellus gas from Northern Pennsylvania to markets along the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic regions. We're targeting an in-service date in the third quarter of 2015.","On the minerals and midstream front, we previously announced 2 strategic agreements with Hilcorp Energy for hydrocarbon and infrastructure investment in the heart of the liquids-rich portion of the Utica. Our 50-50 infrastructure JV with Hilcorp, called Pennant Midstream, will invest about $300 million in its first phase with in-service targeted during the second half of 2013. NiSource will construct and operate the facilities, contribute half of the capital required. Once construction of the first phase is complete, the system will provide about 400 million cubic feet per day of gathering capacity and approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capabilities. I'd note that the first phase of the gathering system is anchored by Hilcorp's production and that the network is being engineered and built with expansion in mind. This includes additional processing capacity and pipeline facilities as producer demand in the area develops.","Ultimately, the total Pennant investment opportunity could exceed $1 billion. A separate joint agreement with Hilcorp is focused on developing the hydrocarbon potential on approximately 100,000 combined acres in Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. NiSource will participate in the development of the acreage, owning both a working and overriding royalty interest with all acreage dedicated to the Pennant Midstream project. These interests could amount to over 5% of the combined acreage. Test wells are currently being drilled, and based on the results from those wells, a full drilling program will be launched in 2013.","So to say the least, these joint arrangements are significant for NiSource. They provide near- and long-term earnings growth opportunities, primarily by means of core infrastructure investment, but also by capitalizing on our mineral interest position. They also provide a model for our remaining acreage position, as delineation, development and producer activity in the Utica region continues.","Also in our Midstream business, work is continuing on the $150 million Big Pine Gathering System in Western Pennsylvania. This project provides customers with alternative outlets from Marcellus Shale production with transportation capacity of 425 million cubic feet per day and the flexibility to deliver to 3 interstate pipelines. Anchored by a long-term agreement with XTO Energy, this project is on budget and on schedule and will be fully in-service by early 2013.","As a reminder, to help you track our many NGT&S projects, we've added a map and project slides -- slide in the appendix of our supplemental slides. Please take a look at Slide 9. Clearly, our NGT&S team continues to advance a broad array of initiatives to meet the needs of customers, assure continued system reliability and leverage our unparalleled strategic position in shale production regions. We anticipate investing $500 million to $700 million annually in this business going forward.","Let's now shift to Indiana and our electric business, summarized on Slide 6. NIPSCO's quarter was solid and squarely in line with our plan. Operating earnings came in at about $78 million compared to about $73 million for the same period last year. Revenues were up about $27 million due to increased margins as a result of NIPSCO's 2011 electric rate case.","With our new Executive Vice President and group CEO, Jim Stanley, now on board, the team notched significant wins in a variety of areas. First, NIPSCO received Indiana Commission approval to move forward with an FGD scrubber unit in our Michigan City plant. Construction of the unit will begin in 2013, with an investment of approximately $250 million. I note that construction of the FGD units at our Schahfer facility remain on schedule and on budget. All told, our environmental investments will approach $900 million over the next few years.","NIPSCO also received FERC approval to move forward on 2 significant electric transmission enhancement projects. One, which we announced on our last quarterly call, is the 100-mile Reynolds to Hiple transmission project. It'll involve a total investment of about $300 million. The second project is a partnership with Pioneer LLC called Reynolds to Greentown project. The 50-50 partnership will invest about $330 million in this 66-mile line. Both projects are expected to be placed in-service during the latter part of the decade. The cost of these projects will go to all MISO customers, with only a small percentage recovered from NIPSCO's customers.","Looking further ahead, the NIPSCO team will continue taking steps to improve reliability and spur a continued economic development in Northern Indiana. That effort will include modernization of our core electric system, the replacement of transformers, poles, lines and other vital equipment. And going forward, we expect to invest $400 million to $450 million annually in our NIPSCO Electric infrastructure.","Let's turn now to our Gas Distribution Operations, or NGD, summarized on Slide 7. Our NGD team continues to deliver strong and steady results from its core business plan. That well-established strategy centers on aligning long-term infrastructure and enhancement programs with complementary customer programs and regulatory initiatives.","For the quarter, NGD's net revenues were up about $13 million, primarily reflecting regulatory and infrastructure programs. Since the start of 2012, these programs have generated nearly $30 million in incremental revenues. On the regulatory front, just last night, we received an order from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities for our base rate case. Although we're continuing to evaluate the full scope of the 500-page order, which will increase annual revenues by about $8 million, we believe the outcome is generally in line with our expectations.","In Pennsylvania, our team recently filed a rate case with the commission. Consistent with Pennsylvania's recently enacted Act 11, the case reflects a fully projected test year and includes improved infrastructure investment recovery mechanisms. The case, which we expect to be resolved in the second half of 2013, proposes to increase annual revenues by approximately $77 million, largely driven by our significant, ongoing infrastructure investments in the commonwealth. Meanwhile, we continue to advance infrastructure enhancement programs, as well as a broad array of new customer programs in Ohio, Virginia and our other states. And a prospective scope of these programs continues to grow. In fact, as Joe Hamrock outlined at our September Investor Day, our long-term infrastructure replacement program opportunity at NGD could top $10 billion over the next 20-plus years. We expect that opportunity to translate into an investment run rate of between $600 million and $650 million annually at NGD.","Before moving to your questions, let me briefly reiterate a few themes we shared at our recent Investor Day. I'd note that you can still take a look at the full presentation and review the webcast. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of nisource.com.","First and foremost, we have a robust inventory of infrastructure-focused investment opportunities across each of our businesses. The total inventory amounts to $25 billion to $30 billion over the next couple of decades and supports a sustainable, annual capital investment of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion going forward. Through those investments, we anticipate growing net operating earnings per share, non-GAAP, by an average of 5% to 7% per year on a long-term basis. We also plan to continue to provide an attractive and growing dividend, one that we expect to increase at 3% to 5% annually. And we're unconditionally committed to accomplishing all of this while maintaining our solid investment-grade credit ratings and strong liquidity. These commitments, coupled with the team's established track record of disciplined execution, continue to make NiSource a compelling investment proposition for all our financial stakeholders.","As always, we'll communicate with you and our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Our next formal communications with the market is scheduled for mid-February, when we'll release our full 2012 -- full year 2012 earnings and provide a business update. Consistent with the practice followed by many of our peers, we'll issue our year-end earnings contemporaneously with our 10-K filing. At that time, we'll also outline our 2013 earnings guidance and capital investment plans.","Thank you for participating this morning and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Leanne, we can open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We already have a question waiting, and that comes on the line from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Hilcorp. Did you -- I just kind of missed -- may have missed it. Did you say the opportunity, currently $300 million, could grow to $1 billion?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's right. We believe that the downstream infrastructure opportunity, assuming robust drilling and activity in that region in the Utica, could approach $1 billion for the entire partnership. So our share would be about $0.5 billion.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can I have a sense of the timeframe?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. We think this is a 5-year, 7-year sort of proposition. Again, it's going to depend on the pace of drilling activity in the region.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And your third quarter report indicated some positive preliminary drilling results. Can you just elaborate?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, Hilcorp has been active in the area of interest. They drilled a number of test wells. They're looking at frac-ing approaches, tracking approaches. We don't have IP information at this point, but the initial results and tests indicate that we're in the sweet spot of the region.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Where is that exactly?","Robert C. Skaggs","It's a 4-county area, 2 counties in Ohio and 2 counties bordering in Pennsylvania.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman for Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On the filing last month in Pennsylvania, Columbia Gas filing, would -- is there anything in the filing that's not consistent with Act 11? Or is this pretty much a -- I won't -- I guess it's not a formality, but certainly your expectations would be that everything would be approved. On that matter, is there something that's a little different?","Robert C. Skaggs","No. It's fully consistent with Act 11, but I'd make this key observation. We're the first out of the gate. So this is going to be the first case that the commission will consider under Act 11. So it will be, to a degree, precedent setting in breaking new ground in that respect.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then going to NIPSCO on the transmission. When you said FERC approved your joint venture line with Pioneer, the whole thing has been approved, not just your 50%. Is that correct? Am I misunderstanding that?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then with respect to the transmission, is there anything on the horizon that -- additional projects with Pioneer or on your own in that transmission?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, the team, the electric transmission team in NIPSCO continues to do a lot of work with projects, in particular in consultation with MISO. So stay tuned for additional opportunities as the months and years unfold. We believe we certainly have the opportunity to increase the portfolio and the investment opportunity as we look at decongesting MISO and providing increased reliability and increased ability to move electrons from the West to the East.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then finally, on your dividend policy, the 3% to 5% annually. Since -- it looks like your CapEx is running maybe a little ahead of what you outlined previously, which is obviously good if it's good projects. How will the Board look at that next year? Will they -- just because the CapEx is running higher, do you think they might be at the lower end of that dividend growth range? Or was that not an issue?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, let me put the policy in perspective. We've said that the payout ratio should be between 60% and 70%. This year, we're going to be right in the middle of that range, and going forward, we'd like to continue to be, give or take, well within in the range. So the Board's going to look at where we stand with regard to the payout ratio. They're going to look at our intention to consistently grow the dividend. And they're going to look at that 3% to 5% guideline that we provide. So they're going to take all those factors in along with where we stand on CapEx, where we stand with the credit rating agencies, and I think they're going to base their decision on those sorts of factors.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And that decision will be made midyear next year?","Robert C. Skaggs","More likely than not. Last year, we announced our dividend action at the Annual Meeting in May. And again, not speaking for the Board, but I believe that would tend to be the period we'd gravitate to.","Operator","We have no further questions waiting at this time. [Operator Instructions]","Robert C. Skaggs","All right, Leanne. And to the folks that have participated, we certainly appreciate your interest. Thanks for your support, and have a good weekend and a safe weekend. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the call for today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"15373":["NiSource (NYSE:NI) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 31, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Glen L.

Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. My name is Janada, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs. Please proceed.","Glen L. Kettering","Thank you, Janada, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of NiSource, I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations. As you know, the focus of our call today is to review our financial performance for the second quarter of 2013 and to provide a business update. We'll then open the call up to your questions. At times during the call, we'll refer to the supplemental slides available on nisource.com.","I'd like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","And now I'll turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Glen, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. For today's agenda, we'll touch on key highlights from another solid quarter. I'll ask Steve Smith, our Chief Financial Officer, to summarize our financial results. I'll then touch on some key upcoming execution markers and initiatives across each of our business units. And then we'll open the call to your questions. Let's start with key takeaways on Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning.","First and foremost, as we announced in our earnings release, NiSource's infrastructure-focused investment strategy once again delivered financial results in line with our expectations and consistent with our 2013 earnings guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60 per share, non-GAAP.","We also announced that, thanks to our robust and growing inventory of accretive infrastructure investment opportunities, we're enhancing our 2013 capital program. We're now targeting an investment level of about $2 billion for 2013, up from our original $1.8 billion plan. Virtually all of these additional capital investments are allocated to track infrastructure replacement and modernization programs. And just a reminder, about 75% of our capital investments are focused on accretive growth and other revenue-generating opportunities.","Another notable development during the quarter was the successful completion of our Pennsylvania rate case. We placed new forward-looking rates into effect July 1 as part of a settlement that, in addition to other benefits, will increase annual revenues by about $55 million. Meanwhile, our team at the Columbia Pipeline Group, or CPG, is on track with the initial phases of our landmark system modernization program. With a number of projects currently in flight, we're on pace to make our first tracker filing by the end of the year, with recovery slated to start in February 2014.","And at NIPSCO, we became the first Indiana utility to file an electric infrastructure modernization plan under recently enacted Senate Bill 560. NIPSCO's 7-year, $1 billion plus plan involves systematic replacement and modernization of our core electric utility infrastructure. We anticipate action by the commission and initiation of the investment early in 2014.","In a nutshell, we're pleased to report continued, steady, disciplined execution of our strategy during the second quarter. With delivery on an expanding array of customer, regulatory and growth initiatives, our team's performance has kept us squarely on target to deliver on our earnings commitments for 2013.","So with that overview, I'll turn the call over to Steve Smith to take a closer look at our second quarter financial results referenced on Page 4 of our supplemental slides.","Stephen P. Smith","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our team again delivered a very strong quarter. NiSource delivered net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of about $73 million, or $0.23 per share, during the second quarter. That compares with about $64 million, or $0.22 per share, for the same period last year. Our operating earnings for the quarter came in at about $195 million.","As we noted on our last quarterly call, our results reflect our $340 million forward sale equity issuance completed in the third quarter of 2012, which added approximately 24 million common shares compared to the same period last year. For 2013, we expect this to have about an $0.08 per share impact on earnings.","On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations for the quarter was about $72 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to about $68 millio,n, or $0.25 per share, in the second quarter of last year. Schedules 1 and 2 to our earnings release show the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items.","Turning to our business units. Columbia Pipeline Group, or CPG, delivered operating earnings of about $89 million in the second quarter compared to $92 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers, were down about $8 million at CPG for the quarter due to reduced depreciation rates resulting from the Columbia Transmission customer settlement. CPG remains on track to deliver earnings in line with our plan for the year.","NIPSCO Electric delivered operating earnings of about $59 million compared to $60 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers, were up about $7 million for the quarter, partially as a result of increased recovery of environmental investments.","And NiSource Gas Distribution, or NGD, delivered operating earnings of $52 million compared to $51 million for 2012. NGD net revenues, again, excluding trackers, were up about $21 million for the quarter due primarily to our infrastructure replacement programs.","As Bob noted, we're pleased to report that we're squarely on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the year.","Turning to Slide 5. Let's quickly touch on our financing and liquidity highlights. Thanks to disciplined capital management practices, our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.4 billion as of the end of the second quarter. We expect this position to maintain its strength throughout the year. This is supported by a number of developments in the first half of the year, including the sale of our retail services business, proactive financing and the extension of bonus depreciation.","Finally, I will note that as of June 30, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 58.6%, which is what we expect to effectively maintain on an ongoing basis, give or take 1% or so.","Before turning the call back to Bob, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate NiSource's core financial commitments, which are: maintaining our stable investment grade credit ratings; growing earnings by 5% to 7% annually; growing the dividend by 3% to 5% annually; and maintaining a strong liquidity position, all while supporting our approximately $2 billion investment program.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Steve. Let's start with the CPG highlights on Slide 6. Jimmy Staton and his team are working overtime to develop and deliver a diverse mix of value-adding infrastructure investment opportunities. At the forefront, Columbia Gas Transmission is making good progress on its long-term system modernization program. And as I noted earlier, we're on track to file our first year modernization tracker filing by the end of this year, with recovery slated to start in February 2014.","As you know, the settlement covers the initial 5 years of a projected modernization program of $4 billion to $5 billion over 10 to 15 years. On the midstream front, with the Big Pine Gathering System in service with XTO Energy, we're also scheduled to start providing long-term gathering services for PennEnergy later this year. Big Pine is capable of transporting more than 400 million cubic feet per day of Marcellus Shale gas.","Phase 1 of our Pennant project, which we call the Hickory Bend Gathering System, is also tracking well. In fact, the initial gathering service is already in progress on part of the system to accommodate Hilcorp's early Utica Shale production. The processing and gathering facilities, 200 million cubic feet per day and 600 million cubic feet per day, respectively, are expected to start by the end of this year.","From a production standpoint, our resource development arrangement with Hilcorp is progressing according to plan. Although the development of the acreage is still in its early stages, 6 wells are now complete. Five of those wells are currently producing, and with each well, drilling and stimulation techniques continue to be optimized.","Notably, we remain encouraged as the initial production flows are consistent with some of the better flows reported in the area. Drilling activity will continue to accelerate, and we anticipate that by 2014, we will be completing 25 to 30 wells per year. All in all, very much in line with our expectations.","Our commercial team also is moving ahead on a new project to modernize and upgrade our existing LNG peaking facility in Chesapeake, Virginia. It's a $30 million, 3-year upgrade. In sync with this upgrade, all existing costumers signed new long-term agreements at increased rates to support the projects.","At Millennium Pipeline, the partnership placed the approximately $45 million Minisink Compressor station into service in the second quarter and anticipates placing the Hancock Compressor station into service by the end of this year or early 2014. This approximately $45 million project will increase the pipeline's delivery capacity to 850,000 dekatherms per day.","And as we discussed in prior calls, our East Side and West Side Expansion projects are on schedule. These projects represent a combined investment of more than $400 million and together will add about 800,000 dekatherms per day of new transportation capacity on our systems. The initial level of service has already begun on the West Side Expansion.","Let's now shift to Indiana in our electric business, as summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO continued to deliver positive results on many, many fronts in the first half of the year. As I mentioned, earlier this month, we were the first to file a 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Our plan, which will kick into gear in early 2014, includes investments in our core distribution and transmission systems, which are good for the sustainability and reliability of infrastructure in Northern Indiana and support continued economic development and job creation in our service territory.","I would also note that NIPSCO will file a similar infrastructure modernization plan for our gas operations later this year. The plan will address system modernization and expansion to rural areas of Northern Indiana.","NIPSCO remains on track with the $0.5 billion plus FGD project at our Schahfer Generating Station. These new units will be placed into service in the fourth quarter of this year and in 2014.","Construction is also moving ahead at our Michigan City Generating Station, where NIPSCO is installing another $250 million FGD unit. On the electric transmission front, NIPSCO is moving forward with an overall investment of up to $0.5 billion for 2 electric transmission projects in Northern Indiana.","These projects will strengthen the Midwest electrical infrastructure while supporting economic development and providing new jobs. The planning and outreach activities are the key focus for those projects in 2013, with in-service targeted for the latter part of the decade. Final route selection is anticipated in August of this year for the first project, the so-called Reynolds-Topeka line. So as you can see, across many fronts, NIPSCO is generating long-term sustainable results for customers, communities and shareholders.","Let's turn now to our Gas Distribution Operations discussed on Slide 8. Our NGD team continues to deliver strong results by aligning its long-term $10 billion infrastructure replacement and enhancement program with a variety of complementary customer and regulatory initiatives. As I noted earlier, we placed new forward-looking rights into effect on July 1 at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania.","Also on the regulatory front, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Maryland all have rate cases in front of their respective commissions. In Kentucky, the case seeks an annual revenue increase of about $17 million. The case also includes a more modern rate design using a revenue normalization adjustment. In Massachusetts, the case is designed to support the company's expanded infrastructure efforts with timely recovery. The case seeks increased annual revenues of about $30 million. And in Maryland, we're seeking an annual revenue increase of about $5 million. We expect a decision with rates effective in Kentucky in January 2014, in Massachusetts during the first quarter of 2014 and in Maryland in late September of this year.","Finally, in June, NIPSCO, along with the Indiana Consumer Counselor and other stakeholders, filed a unanimous agreement with the IURC to extend NIPSCO's 2010 natural gas customer rate settlement through 2020. The decision on the filing is expected by the end of this year. This is a great win-win settlement that will continue to deliver benefits for all our major stakeholders.","And in Virginia, Columbia Gas of Virginia received an order approving an amendment to its SAVE program for infrastructure replacement. The order authorized an annual spending level of $25 million, up from about $20 million.","Consistent with our plan, our NGD team is continuing to execute on its established strategy of investing in safety and reliability while providing innovative programs to customers and solid financial performance for shareholders.","To wrap up, teams across NiSource are continuing to deliver on our core investment and customer-focused strategy, and we are well positioned to meet our growth and other commitments on a disciplined, balanced and sustainable basis going forward. As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders about these and other matters of importance in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com.","Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and in support of NiSource. Janada, let's now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about kind of year-to-date results are down, kind of the earnings projected for the balance of the year and the drivers there?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, I'm going to toss that to Steve, Paul.","Stephen P. Smith","Yes, sure. Thanks, Paul. The year-to-date results so far are right in line with our expectations for our guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60. And I would note that we had a number of items that came in the first 6 months that will be benefiting the latter half of the year. For example, the Columbia Pennsylvania rate case is effective July 1, so that's going to contribute significantly to the latter half of 2013. We also had an IRP filing in Ohio in the May time frame, so we'll be enjoying those benefits throughout the balance of the year. And in addition, we also had an environmental recovery mechanism tracker in Indiana filed at that time frame as well, which will benefit us going forward. On the pipeline side, we also have a number of projects that will be coming up to speed for us in the latter part of the year. First is the Pennant project and the Big Pine project, both of which that Bob mentioned, and also the Millennium Minisink project for the latter half of the year. So we feel very comfortable about where we stand year to date. We think we're squarely in line with where we expect to be and believe our guidance is appropriate and are reaffirming it.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And I guess you've obviously basically lapped the new shares as well?","Stephen P. Smith","That's correct.","Robert C. Skaggs","Correct. Yes. Paul, I would just say, just from our perspective, a clean quarter. And again, what's notable are the accomplishments the team posted on the initiatives.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And is this Michigan City new capital or have we talked about that before?","Robert C. Skaggs","It's been in the plan, and we have talked about it fairly extensively. So it's reflected in the numbers.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just with the increased capital this year, any updates on financing plans?","Stephen P. Smith","Well, I would say, as you know, we did a $750 million, 30-year bond deal not too long ago at 4.8%. With respect to additional financing in 2013, we're looking at potentially tapping the markets in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter in the $300 million to $500 million range. We haven't yet determined what the appropriate maturity will be there. But we expect to do some capital markets activity on the debt side in late third quarter or early fourth quarter of this year.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, Paul. And you'll recall that at our Analyst Day last year, we suggested the need for equity in and around 2015 in an amount that would be similar to what we did a couple of years ago. And we believe, for planning purposes and modeling, that continues to be a sound assumption. And Steve can mention a couple of things that have enhanced our cash position. In fact, he alluded to those in his prepared remarks. But, Steve, maybe you can give a little more color around that.","Stephen P. Smith","Right. Thanks, Bob. Yes, the other things that we were able to accomplish here in the first of the year was the sale of our NiSource retail services business for approximately $120 million. The other benefit that we're enjoying is the extension of bonus depreciation, which should contribute approximately $250 million of benefit to us. So that's in excess of $350 million of incremental cash that are helping us spend at a slightly higher rate this year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess you didn't have those items on the radar when you talked about equity in '15?","Stephen P. Smith","We did not.","Robert C. Skaggs","We did not.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","When I look at Slide 10, it looks like the 2013 CapEx for gas distribution is up about $100 million. And then when I go to Slide 16, I don't see any changes versus this slide in the last quarter. So is it just an acceleration of these projects, is what's going on? There's nothing that was added that I see, is that correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct in part. It is an acceleration of some of the spending that we have inherently with the infrastructure replacement programs. It's also a bit of an uptick in new business. So we are seeing some organic growth, if that's the right term, in new customer additions. And that's helped elevate the number.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Bob, what state is the growth coming from?","Robert C. Skaggs","We're seeing it across all of the companies. Typically, we see more in Virginia, relatively speaking, but we're seeing a bit of an uptick across the board. Now having said that, it's not dramatic. But over the past couple of years, we've seen the new adds come back. All told, across the Gas Distribution group, probably $100 million, $125 million is spent on new customer additions -- will be spent for new customer additions in 2013.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that would account for, let's say, about half of the $200 million step up, is natural gas? And then the rest of it was...","Robert C. Skaggs","It was at CPG.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And again, that's just an acceleration? Or I guess you added also the LNG project?","Robert C. Skaggs","You're really going down the right track. It's a number of relatively small incremental projects that surfaced during the year, and we felt confident enough to launch those programs and increase the spend.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Now I notice under Pennant, the gas gathering went from 400 million cubic feet per day to 600. Is that part of that acceleration or things are going better on the drilling?","Robert C. Skaggs","No, no. It's still consistent with plan. So it's still consistent with plan. We've talked about additional phases down the road for Pennant. We're not there yet, but as I suggested in the prepared remarks, we're very encouraged by initial drilling results. We're encouraged by the additional -- or the drilling program for 2014. And so Pennant remains on track.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then moving just to Indiana, on Senate Bill 560. If you take Senate Bill 560 and the trackers there and you combine that with the trackers you have for the environmental spend on the generation, I mean, it is -- it would appeared to me, that, that covers a good chunk of your CapEx and you might avoid a general rate case for quite a while. Is that a correct way of looking at it?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, your first point is correct. Across NiSource, about 75% of our spend is via tracking mechanisms or relatively frequent rate cases. So a number like that, 75%, is probably relatively a good number to use at NIPSCO. Now the point on rate case, the Senate Bill 560 requires a filing company, somebody participating in that program, to file a rate case within that 7-year period. Our current expectations, and they're current, would suggest we would file at the latter stages of that 7-year period. But that's as we stand here today.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I realize it's a new program, but on the Gas Distribution side, the Senate Bill 560, that tracker, is really, it appears to me, very similar to the trackers you have in other states with respect to gas distributions. Is that correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","Similar. There are some differences, but it's very, very similar. It's akin to what we see in other states.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I've got another one, but I wanted to give other people a chance. Effective tax rate, I notice both first and the second quarter was down. Do you see that going on for the second half? And is there any guidance you can provide?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes, no. Charles, that's a deferred tax liability that we had on the balance sheet we didn't need to carry any longer. And so that benefit was approximately $4 million in the quarter. And we also had a few other items that contribute $1 million here or there. So we don't expect that effective tax rate to continue at that rate. We anticipate that it will bounce back up.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So we'd be still looking at maybe mid-30s for the remainder of the year?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes.","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the only thing I had was just out of -- really more of a curiosity on the transmission. You said you're going to the second round of public hearings on those lines?","Robert C. Skaggs","We just completed that, the second round.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm just curious, what's the difference between the second round and the first round? What actually transpires?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, it's a process. So the first round, you basically introduce the projects. You introduce the approximate routing. The second round, you come back with more concrete information that begins to hone in or narrow down to a more specific route. And again, you give the opportunity to folks to vet that, to lodge their concerns, their interests and the like, and we try to be responsive. So it's part of a comprehensive outreach plan.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bob Skaggs for any closing remarks.","Robert C. Skaggs","All right, Janada. Thank you, everybody. Again, we appreciate your participation, your interest and support. And we will see you in the not-too-distant future. Have a great day. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"15711":["NiSource Inc.

Please go ahead, Sir.","Randy Hulen","Thanks, Skyler, and good morning, everyone and welcome to the NiSource third quarter 2019 investor call. Joining me today are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer. The purpose of this presentation is to review NiSource's financial performance for the third quarter of 2019 as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.","Before turning the floor over to Joe and Donald, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","Additionally, some of the statements made on this recording relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.","With all that out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.","Joe Hamrock","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our NiSource teams continue their relentless focus on our core commitments of safety and customer satisfaction and our long-term utility modernization programs that enhance safety and reliability while driving our financial results.","We've also made significant progress on our electric generation strategy in Indiana with the approval of the Rosewater wind project and the filing of a second joint venture wind project Indiana Crossroads. Our execution through the third quarter has positioned NiSource to meet our financial commitments for 2019 and today we're initiating guidance for 2020.","There's much to cover, so let's turn to Slide 3 which summarizes our key accomplishments through the third quarter and early fourth quarter. Consistent with our long-term growth commitments, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.36 to $1.40 and to make capital investments of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020.","As we've stated before, we expect to grow our non-GAAP earnings per share and dividend by 5% to 7% annually and to make capital investments of $1.7 billion to $2 billion each year through 2022. Our third quarter 2019 non-GAAP net operating earnings were $0.00 per share versus $0.10 in 2018.","Donald will address the drivers for the quarter in a few minutes but I will emphasize that NiSource remains well positioned to deliver net operating earnings per share within our $1.27 to $1.33 guidance range for 2019. We expect to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2019, slightly above our initial forecast for the year.","We're making solid progress on our foundational commitment to safety including accelerated implementation of a Safety Management System or SMS. Our SMS is aligned with the framework, developed for pipeline operators by the American Petroleum Institute. SMS is a comprehensive approach to managing safety, emphasizing continual assessment and improvement in identifying and mitigating potential operational risks proactively.","As part of our SMS work, enhanced risk management processes have been introduced at each of our Gas Distribution companies. Our SMS team has completed its first set of risk asset analysis which will help inform our maintenance priorities and investment decisions. The team has also introduced a Corrective Action Program or CAP, which offers a simple way for our employees and contractors to report safety concerns and provides a systematic process to review, prioritize, address and track progress to reduce risk. This program is available across our gas business in support and corporate functions.","In addition to SMS implementation, safety enhancements to our low-pressure Gas Distribution systems remain a priority. Teams have installed more than 1000 automatic shutoff devices across the NiSource footprint this year, including completing all installation of these devices in Massachusetts and Virginia. These automatic shutoff devices operate like circuit breakers to provide an additional level of control and protection. When the device senses an operating pressure that is too high or too low, it is designed to immediately shut down natural gas to the system, regardless of the cause. Our teams have also located and mapped all of our nearly 2,100 low-pressure regulator station control or sensing lines. We use this information to add new details into our electronic mapping systems.","Earlier this month, we named Chuck Shafer to the newly created position of Chief Safety Officer. Reporting directly to me, Chuck is accountable for driving our long-term multiyear outlook and roadmap to reduce risk, providing an independent view and source of safety expertise and risk analysis across all NiSource companies. He is leading a centralized safety function to provide structured oversight and expertise in assuring rigorous emphasis on safety.","Our electric generation strategy continues to advance in Indiana. We've issued our second request for proposals for replacement capacity. The RFP is consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and all coal generation to be retired by 2028 to be replaced by lower-cost cleaner options.","The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved the joint venture agreement for our Rosewater wind project and we recently filed a CPCN application for a second joint venture wind project, Indiana Crossroads. The hearing in our electric base rate case concluded in August and we expect an IURC order in the fourth quarter with new rates effective in January 2020.","Turning now to Massachusetts. The National Transportation Safety Board or NTSB, last week issued a final report in its investigation of our September 2018 event in the Merrimack Valley. Last month, the NTSB also closed two open urgent safety recommendations issued last year. The NTSB had made four such recommendations to NiSource in November 2018 and has now deemed our responses to these urgent recommendations as acceptable.","With the NTSB investigation now complete, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities announced its own investigations of the incident in our emergency preparedness and response. In mid-August, we completed our restoration efforts in the Merrimack Valley. This restoration included the replacement of all customer equipment impacted by the event and fulfilled our commitment to have that work completed by September 15. We also repaired outdoor areas affected by our fall 2018 construction work, including residential lawns, irrigation systems, walkways, driveways and state roads throughout the impacted communities.","A dedicated team remains in place, providing support to impacted customers, assisting with claims processing and providing repair support on appliances and heating equipment. As announced in September, we launched a verification process which involves inspections of gas service lines abandoned as part of the fall 2018 recovery work in Greater Lawrence. These verifications as required by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities are confirming that the service lines were abandoned, consistent with legal requirements and in compliance with our procedures and protocols.","As we find any service line abandonments that didn't meet those requirements, we are correcting the situation immediately. We completed the initial set of 700 verifications by the required deadline of October 18. The second set of approximately 2,200 verifications is well underway and expected to be complete by November 15.","And as announced late yesterday, we are planning to verify the remaining approximately 2,000 service lines by year-end. These verifications are being done on abandoned service lines which are not connected to an active gas system and therefore will not disrupt gas service to our customers. We know that recent events in the Merrimack Valley have led many to lose trust in Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and the customers in the affected communities are worried about whether they're safe in their own homes.","We take responsibility for that loss in security. And as part of our comprehensive efforts to rebuild confidence and trust, we brought in an experienced safety leader who knows Massachusetts. Earlier this month, we named Nick Stavropoulos as Chief Safety Advisor at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, reporting directly to me. Nick has led several of the country's largest gas companies, including PG&E, National Grid and KeySpan and has the judgment experience and relentless safety focus to help us through these challenging times.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?","Donald Brown","Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Looking at our third quarter results from slide 4, we had a non-GAAP net operating loss of about $2 million or $0.00 per share compared to net operating earnings of about $35 million or $0.10 per share for the same period in 2018. The biggest drivers of our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance compared to a year ago were higher net revenues, due to the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, which were offset by increased safety-related spending and higher financing costs. Our 2019 year-to-date net operating earnings are in line with our plans, which puts us on track to achieving our 2019 guidance of $1.27 to $1.33 per share.","Before turning to our liquidity and financing plan, I'd like to address Greater Lawrence incident expenses. Our total estimate, which is detailed on slide 9 has remained unchanged from our Q2 earnings release.","Going forward with the restoration work complete and the service line verification work nearing completion, we continue to not expect any significant future adjustments to the estimate. However, as a reminder this estimate excludes any amounts we may incur for potential fines and penalties.","Also as we previously stated, we expect to recover a substantial portion of our Greater Lawrence incident costs through the $800 million of casualty insurance coverage and $300 million of property insurance in place at the time of the event. We started submitting claims in December 2018 and have collected casualty insurance recoveries of $670 million through September 30th and expect to collect the remaining $130 million for early next year.","We also have filed proof of loss with our property insurer for the full cost of the $255 million to $260 million capital investment that we made in replacing the 45 miles of pipe following the event. As the insurance recovery process moves forward, we'll continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress.","Now turning to slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Following the August issuance of $750 million of 10-year notes at 2.95% interest, our total debt level as of September 30th was about $9.5 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt.","The weighted average maturity of our long-term debt was approximately 17 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.4%. At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.4 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we're committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings.","I'd now like to turn to slide 6, which covers our financing plan for our long-term growth investments. Our current plan is approximately $500 million of long-term debt in 2020 and continue to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our at-the-market or ATM equity issuance program, as well as $35 million to $60 million from our Employee Stock Purchase and other programs. Our ATM continues to be consistent with our approach to provide balanced predictable financing for our ongoing infrastructure investments.","The primary change to our financing plan is that we now expect a block equity issuance in the range of $500 million to $700 million in 2020. This change is driven by the need to permanently finance the Greater Lawrence event, which excluding the capital investment is estimated to cost approximately $1.4 billion. This total cost estimate is offset by casualty insurance recoveries that are expected to total $800 million and that leaves approximately $600 million to be financed.","We evaluated several different approaches to this incremental financing needs and determined that the best option to maintain our credit profile and to achieve our 5% to 7% annual non-GAAP EPS growth commitment is to pursue a common equity issuance in 2020.","In our analysis, we believe common equity is less costly than hybrid security alternatives therefore we are no longer planning to issue any hybrid securities such as preferred equity in 2019 or 2020. As Joe mentioned earlier in the call we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.36 to $1.40 in 2020, which includes the impact of this updated financing plan. This is consistent with our long-term forecast to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividends by 5% to 7% annually through 2022 and we expect to make $1.7 billion to $2 billion at annual capital investments each year from 2020 through 2022.","Now I'll turn the call back to Joe for a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.","Joe Hamrock","Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2019 from our gas operations on slide 7. In Maryland our base rate case request remains pending before the Maryland Public Service Commission. Filed in May, the request supports continued replacement of aging pipelines and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades.","If approved as filed the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $3.7 million including $1.2 million of current infrastructure tracker revenue. A commission order is expected by the end of 2019 with rates in effect in January 2020.","In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission in August approved its first annual adjustment to our Capital Expenditure Program rider. The CEP rider, which was first approved by the PUCO in 2018, allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through our infrastructure modernization tracker. The approved adjustment allows us to begin recovery of approximately $122 million in capital invested in 2018. New rates became effective in September.","In Indiana, our latest tracker update request in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program remains pending. The request covers $12.4 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2018 and April 2019. An Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 with rates effective November 2019.","I would also note that we filed a notice to terminate our current program in anticipation of filing a new plan application by year end. Also in Indiana, the IURC last month approved our PHMSA compliance plan, covering approximately $230 million of capital expected to be invested between 2019 and 2023.","In Kentucky, we filed our annual rider update application in our accelerated main replacement program, covering approximately $40 million in planned capital investment. Included in that filing is a request to recover capital that will be spent on our low-pressure systems safety enhancement work.","Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on slide 8. In August, the IURC approved the joint venture and ownership agreement for Rosewater, one of three wind projects that NIPSCO announced in February 2019. The IURC in June approved Power Purchase Agreement applications for the other two projects Jordan Creek and Roaming Bison.","And earlier this month, NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for a fourth wind project, Indiana Crossroads, a joint venture with EDP Renewables North America LLC, which will have an aggregate nameplate capacity of 302 megawatts. It is expected to be in operation in the fourth quarter of 2021.","As I mentioned earlier, NIPSCO on October 1 announced the opening of its second request for proposals to consider potential resources to meet the future electric needs of its customers. Consistent with the 2018 Integrated Resource Plan, we will consider all sources in the RFP process, which closes November 20.","Our goal is to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for technology and market changes. The hearing concluded in August in our electric base rate case, which remains pending before the IURC. Prior to the hearing, we filed two partial settlement agreements in the case.","The April settlement addresses our revenue requirement, federal tax reform and depreciation schedules related to the early retirement of our coal-fired generation plant called for in our 2018 IRP. If approved as filed, the partial settlement is earnings neutral and allows for a return on equity of 9.9%.","In May, we reached a settlement with the industrial group, which resolves many issues related to implementing a new service structure for industrial customers. An IURC order is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2019 with new rates effective in January 2020.","We continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.","The IURC approved TDSIC program represents approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investment expected to be made through 2022. Our latest tracker update request covering $131.1 million in incremental capital investments made from December 2018 through June 2019 remains pending before the IURC. An order is expected in the fourth quarter 2019 with rates effective in January 2020.","Before revisiting our key takeaways for the quarter, I'd like to highlight a couple of milestones. In September, NiSource was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the sixth consecutive year. We were one of three U.S. multi-utility companies on the list, and it reflects advancements we continue to make on our sustainability strategy, which includes aggressive greenhouse gas reductions and executing against more than $30 billion of long-term infrastructure investments.","Customers and investors alike expect our companies to deliver energy safely, reliably and in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way. We continue to focus on delivering on all of these dimensions. And if you haven't seen it, I encourage you to read our 2018 climate report, which we published on nisource.com in August.","The report incorporates recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures or TCFD to disclose governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics around climate-related risks and opportunities. We've taken an industry-leading approach to addressing climate change by developing plans that result in a project in 90% reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, including a projected 50% reduction in methane emissions from natural gas distribution mains and service lines by 2025.","Before we turn to the Q&A portion of the call, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. Consistent with our long-term growth commitment in 2020 we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.36 to $1.40 and to make capital investments of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.","NiSource remains well positioned to deliver net operating earnings per share within our $1.27 to $1.33 guidance range for 2019. We expect to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2019, slightly above our initial forecast for the year. Our long-term investment-driven growth plan is intact and resilient. Inclusive of the adjustments made to our financing plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2022. And we expect to maintain our current investment-grade credit ratings.","Safety remains the foundation for all that we do and we're advancing that commitment with our accelerated SMS implementation across our seven-state footprint. Through SMS, we're increasing our rigor to identify risks and taking action to keep our employees, contractors, customers and communities safe. And we continue to execute on safety enhancements to our low-pressure system. Our electric generation strategy is advancing with three wind projects approved and the fourth one proposed and the second RFP issued to identify additional sources to replace our coal capacity. Our electric base rate case is on track with partial settlements in place and the hearing on contested issues complete and an IURC order expected this quarter.","Significant milestones have been achieved in our recovery from the Merrimack Valley event with the NTSB issuing its final report, and the second phase of the restoration completed. We continue to work to rebuild confidence and trust in the community. We're working diligently to assure the quality of last fall's construction work and we brought in an experience gas safety leader, who knows Massachusetts.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Skyler?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning to you.","Joe Hamrock","Good morning, Julien.","Donald Brown","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, howdy. So perhaps just to kick things off. Just on the capital front. I know you guys have been talking a good bit about gas safety over the year prospectively continue to talk about it. We'd be curious how you think about this CapEx of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion relative to that kind of longer-term trend through 2022. How do you think the cadence is? How do you think even that guidance through the 2022 period meshes with the potential further spend or effort on gas safety holistically?","Donald Brown","Thanks, Julien and good morning. We look at that our long-term guidance on capital both the $1.7 billion to $2 billion that we've got there. There's a lot of focus on the gas side. We certainly haven't seen significant changes on the investments, because of the SMS approach. We're still early in that process. And I think it won't necessarily change that guidance level, but will change the components of the investments we make in each state there.","When you look at the increase to $2 billion over the next couple of years we've got a couple of significant projects. One in Ohio that's really a looping project in Central Ohio where we've had some significant growth which runs through a tracker program. So that's the real increase that you'll see over the next couple of years in our guidance.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then perhaps, if I can ask you with respect to the incremental equity financing in 2020, how do you think about perhaps some of the puts and takes against reaffirming the longer-term 5% to 7% EPS CAGR? I understand there's a range for reason. I understand that this is a discrete item against the longer-term outlook. But I would be curious, if you perceive other items here whether in 2020 or onwards that might otherwise mitigate the dilutive impact of the incremental equity here.","- Donald Brown","Yes. When we look at the long-term, certainly the plan for next year, but also as we build out the long-term plan that our infrastructure investments and as you see on one of the charts in there there's a significant portion of our investments that are going into trackers. And so we're getting pretty quick returns back on those investments and that really does support the $500 million to $700 million of equity that we've outlined for next year. So we're confident in our ability to meet those commitments and think that we've got certainly levers on the infrastructure program, but our overall operating plan with continued investment in safety and the gas business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you, guys.","Donald Brown","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. ","Shar Pourreza","Hey, good morning, guys.","Joe Hamrock","Good morning, Shar.","Shar Pourreza","Good morning. Can you just real quick -- sticking with Massachusetts, can you just touch on sort of the second gas leak we saw with the restoration project? Is there, sort of, any status or updates? I think the formal investigations have started? And is -- the moratorium that's on non-emergency work do you see any long-term impact in that?","Joe Hamrock","Yes, thanks Shar. That's an important topic to update on. So as we have noted that gas leak did not result in any damage to property or any significant consequences, but it has indeed struck some erosion of confidence and trust and concerns in the community and across the state. So the moratorium as it relates to that is we agree with and we are aligned with the DPU a part of our comprehensive efforts to restore confidence and restore trust. That leak as you know relating to work that was done last year on the rebuild.","So we've taken a hard look at the rebuild itself and we are continuing to verify the service lines that were abandoned throughout that not in any way related to the leak in September. But our efforts there are comprehensive and focused on restoring trust and confidence.","The moratorium itself does two things. It helps to marshal resources for the service line investigations, but also gives us an opportunity to work with the DPU to build assurance of safe operations across the state. We're confident and optimistic that as we work through the remaining phases of the service line abandonment verification and begin to work with the DPU on the audit that we expect to be implemented that we will be on a path to rebuild that trust and confidence and that the moratorium would ultimately be lifted. We don't have a date for that right now, but that's certainly our goal.","In terms of long-term impact, we are factoring in some impacts into our 2020 guidance, but on a fairly moderate basis. We expect the suspension of our modernization work the GSEP work to have an impact in 2020. That's inside the guidance. It's a relatively modest impact on CMA and offset to a degree with capital allocation in other states. So it's something we're navigating through and adjusting to as we go through these steps with the DPU. Yes that's exactly it.","Shar Pourreza","And then just around the rate case. Can we just get a sense on timing? Are you still assuming first quarter? It doesn't seem like, sort of, this moratorium or -- is going to impact the timing. So I guess are you still expecting to file a GRC in the first quarter?","Joe Hamrock","No. We haven't set a date for filing. I think what we've said consistently is we'd look at that early next year we'd start to take a look at that. We have a number of steps we need to work through including the investigations with the DPU. They announced as we noted on the call earlier two investigations. One into the incident last year and the other into the response to the incident. And so working through those will be an important part of the overall process with the DPU as we contemplate future rate case activity.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. And then just lastly on a follow-up on the SMS question from the prior caller. You guys are -- it's preliminary. You're very early in the process. Do you have a sense maybe on the cost of O&M and how that profile can shape as we look to model that on a go-forward basis as you get further into the SMS program?","Donald Brown","Yes. I mean, we've certainly seen some higher cost this year and part of that is really the startup as we look at our process and procedures and roll that out across seven states. I'd say going forward we'll see -- it's a lower increases in the gas segment. We're certainly -- expect that the gas segment will grow 1% to 2% over the next year or so. But the real change comes in our process and procedures and the rigor that we apply to those practices versus increased costs that would drive our overall O&M for the gas segment.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. Okay. I will pass this. Thanks guys.","Donald Brown","Thanks, Shar.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. In regards to the equity issuance, any thoughts or comment you could give on potential timing of that as we head into 2020? Are you potentially thinking about maybe doing a forward in the fourth quarter this year for 2020? And then related to that what weighted average share count should we assume when you're providing the 2020 EPS guidance?","Donald Brown","So, we've got some flexibility on the timing of that equity. We need it by the end of next year to make sure that we hit our rating agency credit targets. So, we haven't determined or decided the timing or how we'll do that including looking at forwards.","But we are -- as you would expect those are all the things that we're looking at and trying to determine what makes the most sense. But we've got some flexibility and certainly don't need it until the end of next year to meet our targets. Randy you have the--?","Randy Hulen","Yes, I think as far as the weighted average share count for this year, it's largely going to be about where the share count is today because we've done most of the activities under a forward that that closes in December of this year that won't really add to the share count on a weighted average basis.","Insoo Kim","So, just to clarify that the $500 million to $700 million that you're assuming at some point in 2020 that's not necessarily embedded in the share count when you're giving the $1.36 to $1.40?","Donald Brown","It will be embedded for next year's guidance, absolutely.","Insoo Kim","Okay. So, that's part of that. And I guess if I'm assuming the midpoint then if I'm spreading that across the year that would probably be relatively a safe assumption of how you're getting to the midpoint?","Donald Brown","You can certainly take that approach.","Insoo Kim","Got it. Just away from that in Indiana with the 300 megawatt Indiana Crossroads wind farm. I assume that was part of the last round of RFPs and kind of separate from the October filing that you guys just made where you're filing for a lot more solar wind and\/or storage. Was that the JV in the partial ownership of Indiana Crossroads part of your growth base growth plan into 2021?","And then when it comes to the current round of RFPs, does that satisfy the -- would that satisfy the capacity that -- and the energy necessary for the 2023 timeframe for the coal reductions?","Joe Hamrock","Let me take the last piece first. It's part of the overall solution for the 2023 capacity replacement. The Crossroads filing that we just made mirrors the model that we pioneered earlier with the Rosewater project. The Rosewater was 100 megawatts, Indiana Crossroads is 300 megawatts. As you know Rosewater approved by the IURC, pending at FERC, and we do have private letter ruling support from the IRS.","So, we think we have got a good model in place to follow with the Crossroads project and it is consistent to your first question with the RFP from last year. It follows from that it's not related to the new RFP.","Most of this is beyond the current CapEx guidance. So, most of what we're talking about with these projects falls beyond 2022. So, our new RFP that's out now we would expect to have into our forecast and planning early next year which should put us in a position sometime next year to extend the guidance beyond 2022.","And at that time, we'll be in a much better position to lay out how these projects and any that come out of the current RFP set up for CapEx beyond 2022 and our overall gross guidance beyond 2022.","Insoo Kim","Understood. Thank you very much.","Joe Hamrock","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, hi. Thank you. Just wanted to clarify -- hey guys -- the additional equity in the 2020 guidance that -- you're not just assuming it goes in at the end of the year 2020, that's it's kind of average through the year or something like that?","Donald Brown","Let me clarify. We have not determined the timing of that equity. But what I would say is we don't need it until the end of the year. So, it certainly gives us some flexibility to do it during the year or at the end of the year.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And in the guidance range -- maybe to ask a different way, in the guidance range for 2020, it's not going to really move it much if you do it earlier than right at year end? Is that fair?","Donald Brown","That's fair.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just in terms of the decision. Because back a few months ago you've been reviewing things like preferreds and hybrids and could you maybe just give a little more clarity on why you decided to do -- this is all equity just to be overly conservative or how did you come to that conclusion?","Donald Brown","Just looking at our current stock price, our expectations of what that cost of equity is and issuance costs versus what we're seeing for preferred -- both the preferred equity and the subordinated debt. And since you don't get the 100% credit from the agencies for those subordinated notes the overall cost to us appears to been lower to issue the equity.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then on the property insurance decision, is there any way to gauge when you might get a decision from the insurers on that?","Donald Brown ","It's still early. So we filed in July with the property insurer. The NTSB report came out in late September. And so we really just started at the process with the insurer that now they have access to the pipe and the report that they can do their due diligence on the claim. And so at this point we don't have any recovery in our plan, but certainly going to go through the process to seek to recover all that we filed for.","Steve Fleishman","Do you have recovery though in Massachusetts in your plan?","Donald Brown","Recovery? What do you mean? In terms of\u2026.","Steve Fleishman","Like all the way some kind of a rate recovery for that, if not property recover rate recovery? Or are you just assuming no recovery?","Donald Brown","So from an insurance standpoint, we would wait for the insurance process to fully finish before requesting any type of recovery on the investments we made last year and early this year in Merrimack Valley. So that timing will matter there on how we seek to recover that through customers.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Donald Brown","Thanks, Steve.","Joe Hamrock","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning Joe and Don. Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to just go back to 2020 drivers. I think you mentioned that O&M would only go up by 1% or 2% in the gas segment. But are there any other kind of major drivers there besides what you've already talked about with potential Massachusetts rate release, interest expense reduction or cost cuts elsewhere? Can you guys hear me?","Donald Brown","I'm sorry. I was muted. So, yes, I do expect that the gas segment will be up slightly year-over-year from an O&M standpoint. But between the corporate segment and the electric segment that will offset an overall O&M should be about flat.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And then any other kind of major rate relief or other drivers that we might be missing there?","Donald Brown","Well, we're going through that planning now to determine which rate cases if any we would file for next year. As you expect, we're typically in a couple every year across our seven states, but we haven't publicly announced if and when we would file the next rate cases.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. That's all I had. Thanks guys.","Donald Brown","Yeah.","Joe Hamrock","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Donald Brown","Good morning, Michael.","Joe Hamrock","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, good morning. On the 5% to 7% growth rate going forward at this point with the extra equity that's out there, are we -- are you expecting to -- that that's going to be the permanent trajectory of $1.30 from 2019 based on that going forward? In other words, there won't be any catch up to the original pre-Lawrence guidance going forward as a result of the additional equity. Would that be fair to say?","Donald Brown","Yeah. I'd really say it's 5% to 7% of off this year's 2019 guidance.","Michael Weinstein","Right, right. So it doesn't -- there's no acceleration coming out of -- from pension asset recovery or faster than expected insurance recoveries or any of that going forward?","Donald Brown","No, not that we're guiding to at this point.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. All right. That's all I have. Thank you.","Donald Brown","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon","You know what guys, you guys have answered all my questions. Thank you. Have a good day.","Donald Brown","Thank you. See you soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint. Your line is now open.","Andrew Levi ","Hey, guys. How are you?","Donald Brown","Good morning, Andy.","Joe Hamrock","Good morning.","Andrew Levi ","Hey, just a few questions. Just on Mass. What percent of your total earnings come from Mass?","Donald Brown","It's about 8% to 9%.","Andrew Levi","8% to 9%, okay. And your CapEx is about $100 million to -- $80 million to $140 million out of your $1.7 billion CapEx budget?","Donald Brown","It's in that range.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So it's really a small piece of your total business and obviously you've taken quite a ding there as far you're -- what you had to put out. But as you stated that seems to be kind of done now. So it seems there's a -- do you guys feel there's an overemphasis on the financial impact going forward not what it was on this part of your -- this segment of your total business, which I guess the rest is 75% tracked? Your earnings are fairly predictable.","Donald Brown","No, I think it is a very good point financially Andy. It is a smaller portion of our business from an earnings standpoint and so it does have less of an impact going forward. But I also understand the concerns and questions that investors and other stakeholders have on that business and how that impacts overall NiSource. But yes it is a smaller portion of our earnings and our capital going forward and that does allow us because we're in six other states to have some flexibility to meet our earnings and growth commitment.","Andrew Levi","And as far as the timing of the equity issuance which is again not that big of an issuance, is that going to happen this year? Or will it not be issued until next year?","Donald Brown","No, we will not do it this year. Certainly with the insurance recoveries coming in faster than expected, we're confident that we'll meet our credit targets for 2019 and so it's definitely a 2020 issuance.","Andrew Levi","Okay. That's helpful. And then the last thing is for Joe. If you kind of look at where the stock is trading whether it's on 2020 guidance or 2021 or 2022 consensus earnings or whether they are a $0.01 higher or lower whatever. They're fairly ballpark I think. The stock trades from anywhere between an 8% to 50% discount to the regulated electric group. Could you kind of just address that and what your thoughts are that they're relative to where you've traded in the past and how as the CEO you plan to fix that?","Joe Hamrock","Yes, thanks, Andy. I think that some of that goes to your earlier question. The core value of the business is intact resilient. We laid out a lot of the investment and regulatory profile even on this call for this year and looking ahead to next year with our guidance. So if you kind of follow the long trajectory here and add to that the work we're doing with our risk analytics and SMS, we see the same if not an enhanced pipeline of the infrastructure investment activities through the foreseeable future then supplement that with the work we're doing to position generation investments in our generation portfolio repositioning work. I'd say we're in a strong, if not a stronger position than we were a year ago set aside Massachusetts and the impact of the Greater Lawrence incident, which as we've talked about today much of the cost of that is now well defined and well accounted for in our plan. So I think it really becomes that core execution strategy and that core execution story that we've always had with a much enhanced level of rigor and risk analytics driving that as we go forward.","Andrew Levi","Okay. Thank you for that. And then just a clarification on the equity timing. So even if -- you're not going to even do a forward this year right? It won't be issued until sometime next year. Is that correct? Or you're just saying as far as when you will actually reflect it?","Joe Hamrock","Exactly. I think we've got some flexibility to do a forward this year. We haven't determined if we will or not, but certainly have flexibility to push equity needs to the end of next year if that's what makes the most sense.","Andrew Levi","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Joe Hamrock","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman","Thank you. Donald, can I impose on you to repeat a comment you made? I don't think I understood it. You were talking about the sizing of the block equity issuance next year $500 million or $700 million. And I thought you said, I suspect I got this wrong the logic of it was directed towards Merrimack Valley, $1.4 billion of cost. You're assuming $800 million of recovery of insurance, which left $600 million. That's what was driving the sizing of the block equity issuance did I get that right?","Donald Brown","That's exactly right. Yes, we need to finance that difference long-term and to meet our credit rating targets we need to issue equity for that difference.","Charles Fishman","Okay. And obviously, there's a lot of other costs associated with SMS and other things you're doing outside of Massachusetts that was maybe in part driven by the events in Merrimack Valley, correct?","Donald Brown","I'd say it was accelerated. That's the mass work where we really started about nine months before Merrimack Valley event in September. But we certainly accelerated that activity post the event to make sure that we started to implement those processes and procedures across all seven states.","Charles Fishman","Okay. And then the $100 million increase in CapEx this year, was that SMS just general gas, general -- electric work or all of the above?","Donald Brown","I'd say it's not SMS. I'd say the big change that we had in this past year, was the low-pressure system work, that we started in 2019 to install the devices across all seven states.","Charles Fishman","This was just an acceleration of that.","Donald Brown","That's right.","Charles Fishman","Okay.","Donald Brown","So that's a big portion of the change, but I'd say, it's kind of across the seven states including electric. That $100 million increase.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Last question, slide 11, I think it's consistent with the slides in the past, where you show what the -- recovery timing of your CapEx. There's a big drop down between 2019, 2020 and then going forward as far as the percentage that you have to go for a -- just a general rate case. Was that driven by Ohio? Or what drove that drop that ledge right there?","Donald Brown","Going forward into 2020 and 2021, it really is Ohio, with the CEP tracker that we have now that most of the capital or all of the capital expense in Ohio is going through the tracker program as well as just increases in Indiana and some other states.","Charles Fishman","And then, you said that -- I assume then it was this change in Ohio that really drove this big transmission project there that you got coming up?","Donald Brown","That's right. That's right.","Charles Fishman","Okay.","Donald Brown","I think -- to think about is, as you look at the difference between 2018, 2019 and going forward is the investment we made, in Greater Lawrence. Yeah until the $255 million to $260 million is reflected in those two numbers and so you've got that switch of significant rate case investment that we wouldn't have going forward.","Charles Fishman","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you very much.","Donald Brown","Yeah.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock, CEO for any closing remarks.","Joe Hamrock","Thank you, Skyler. And thank you all for your engagement today and for your thoughtful and insightful questions. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming EEI Conference.","And until then please make it a safe day. And I appreciate your continued support and engagement.

My name is Grant, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed.","Glen L. Kettering","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of NiSource, I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","The focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the first quarter of 2012 and to provide a business update. We'll then open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we'll refer to the supplemental slides available on our website at nisource.com.","I'd like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this call will be forward-looking and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Glen, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our agenda today will be crisp to leave plenty of time for questions. So we'll review our first quarter earnings which continue to be solid, sustainable and on track with our 2012 outlook. In the process, we'll touch on key achievements and initiatives in each of our business units, progress demonstrating the continued strength of our well established investment-driven growth strategy. And finally, before opening the line to questions, I'll touch again on our core financial commitments to investment-grade credit, long-term earnings growth and a strong, attractive and growing dividend.","Let's start with the first quarter highlights on Slide 3 in the supplemental deck. As our earnings report reflects our NiSource teams are continuing to build on the positive momentum we generated in 2011. We delivered first quarter results squarely in line with our plan, continued earnings growth from robust regulatory, modernization and expansion initiatives and a solid start to our record $1.4 billion capital investment program. All in all, the NiSource team continued to demonstrate its commitment, focus and solid execution during the first quarter. In fact, I believe, we're well on our way towards upping our game in 2012 as we generate even greater value for our customers, investors and other key stakeholders.","With that backdrop, let's take a look at our first quarter results starting with our financial highlights on Slide 4. As you can see, we delivered net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $215 million or $0.76 per share for the 3 months ended March 31. That compares with about $207 million or $0.74 per share for the first quarter of 2011. Our operating earnings for the quarter grew from about $402 million to more than $435 million compared to the same period in 2011. As I noted earlier, these results are squarely in line with our 2012 earnings outlook. On a GAAP basis, our net income for the quarter was about $194 million. Schedules 1 and 2 to our earnings release show the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items, the most significant of which was weather.","Let's now turn to our individual business unit results starting with our NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage, or NGT&S, operations highlighted on Slide 5. At NGT&S, CEO Jimmy Staton and his team have truly hit the ground sprinting in 2012. They are developing and deploying a robust, comprehensive strategy for modernizing our system, meeting customer needs and maximizing the value of our extensive pipeline and storage assets, and that includes our very attractive position in the Marcellus and Utica production regions. From a financial perspective, NGT&S grew operating earnings to about $139 million during the first quarter compared to about $118 million for the same period in 2011. Net revenues were up about $17 million, driven by a number of growth projects at NGT&S, as well as the impact of new rates under Columbia Gulf base rate settlement that took effect in May 2011.","As you know, shale gas development and midstream opportunities are a key focus for our team. One important 2012 project on that front is our midstream services, Big Pine gathering system. Anchored by a long-term agreement with XTO Energy, this 70-mile, $150 million project in western Pennsylvania will offer an initial capacity of 425 million cubic feet per day with interconnections to multiple interstate pipelines. In-service for that project is this December. Our midstream team also is pursuing opportunities in the liquids-rich portion of the Utica play in eastern Ohio. These prospects include proposals to provide gathering services, as well as cryogenic processing.","In addition, on our last quarterly call, I mentioned that we were in discussions with a number of parties regarding possible approaches and arrangements to optimize the value of our Utica acreage position. By way of an update, I'm pleased to report that we're now in advanced discussions with an individual producer counterparty regarding the joint venture in this area, which would include significant downstream infrastructure investment opportunities. We hope to be in a position to announce further details regarding this exciting opportunity within the next month or so.","NGT&S also continues to successfully pursue expansion opportunities along our existing pipeline systems. The $220 million West Side expansion project will transport Marcellus production, originating in southwestern Pennsylvania and north central West Virginia to Gulf Coast markets, leveraging our Columbia Gulf pipeline. Building long-term -- binding long-term precedent agreements have been signed with 2 shippers.","Meanwhile, our East Side expansion project will connect about 500,000 dekatherms per day of northern Pennsylvania Marcellus production with growing mid-Atlantic markets. Negotiations with customers for binding transportation agreements are currently underway. Both of these expansion projects have proposed in-service dates of late 2014.","Another significant Columbia Gas Transmission project took a step forward in March, with FERC approval to construct facilities to serve Virginia Electric and Power Company's 1,300 megawatt generation facility under construction in Warren County, Virginia. Our $35 million project will provide up to 250,000 dekatherms per day of long-term firm transportation starting in mid-2014.","To help better accentuate the various investments we're making across NGT&S, we've added a new map and projects slides in the appendix of our supplemental slides. That graphic and information is shown on Slide 9. I'd urge you to take a close look.","As I noted earlier, significant focus for our team is system modernization. And during the first quarter, NGT&S continued a series of discussions with our customers for a comprehensive, long-term infrastructure modernization program. Similar to the programs at our gas utilities, this effort will enhance the reliability and flexibility of our pipeline system and ensure continued safe and reliable service. It'll also generate jobs, fuel economic growth and position the company to meet anticipated regulatory requirements. In total, we expect the plan could involve an investment of about $4 billion over a 10- to 15-year period.","Our target is to reach comprehensive agreement with our customers and other stakeholders and submit it to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval, which we would hope to receive by year's end. In the event this collaborative approach doesn't bear fruit, we nonetheless remain committed to the program and would avail ourselves of the conventional rate case process to recover the costs associated with our investments in a timely fashion.","This focus on modernization at NGT&S and across NiSource is being recognized. NiSource was front and center on April 20 when U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Ray LaHood, recognized NiSource for its pipeline infrastructure modernization and replacement investment at a press conference in Pittsburgh. During the event, Secretary LaHood strongly endorsed NiSource's significant long-term commitment to energy infrastructure modernization, and the Secretary also announced DOT's commitment to coordinate with other government entities to expedite the regulatory and approval processes in connection with our infrastructure modernization program.","Across NiSource, we're committed to being a leader in enhancing America's core energy infrastructure. These investments help ensure continued reliable and efficient energy delivery, provide a foundation for job creation and economic growth across our service territory. We welcome the DOT's support in facilitating the efficient, timely permitting and regulatory review of our modernization programs, and we look forward to working together to get the job done.","As you can see, our NGT&S team has a diverse mix of new and ongoing projects designed to enhance the long-term value of our assets. Through its supply and market-driven growth, as well as our collaborative approach to system modernization, our team is generating long-term customer benefits and ongoing rate base and earnings growth.","Let's now shift to Indiana in our Electric business as summarized on Slide 6. Our NIPSCO Electric team is advancing an impressive array of initiatives to improve customer service and reliability and to enhance northwest Indiana's environmental and economic sustainability. Earnings from our electric business were solid and squarely on top of our plan for the quarter with operating earnings of about $48.5 million compared with about $49 million for the same period last year. Revenues were up about $29 million due to increased margins, while operating expenses increased about the same amount, largely due to higher employee and administrative expenses, planned generation outage costs and MISO fees that are now included in rates.","The cornerstone of NIPSCO's 2012 business agenda is executing on significant environmental investments at our coal-fired generation facilities. I'm pleased to note that those investments are on plan, including a $500 million investment in new scrubbers at our Schahfer Generating Station. The Schahfer project is the largest in NIPSCO's history and part of a nearly $850 million in new environmental investment at the company over the next 6 to 8 years.","NIPSCO also continued to strengthen its management ranks in the first quarter with the appointment of Kathleen O'Leary to the role of President. Kathleen, who is based in Indianapolis, reports to NIPSCO's CEO, Jimmy Staton, and will lead our regulatory and governmental strategies, economic development and stakeholder engagement efforts. Kathleen brings tremendous industry knowledge and leadership perspective to this key role.","On the customer service front, NIPSCO continue to introduce new offerings with the launch of its IN-Charge Electric Vehicle Program. The program provides a credit for residential electric customers to offset the cost of home-based electric vehicle charging systems. The pilot program also provides free overnight vehicle charging.","The team's laser-like focus on customer service is paying off. As I noted on our last earnings call, NIPSCO continues to improve its J.D. Power ratings. Based on the most recent wave of residential gas customers, NIPSCO remains ahead of the Midwest average for overall customer satisfaction and similar improvements have been made in the electric survey. Again, great work at NIPSCO, as the team continuously improves customer service and reliability, while investing in long-term economic and environmental sustainability across our Indiana service territory.","Let's now turn to our Gas Distribution group discussed on Slide 7. Our NiSource Gas Distribution company has continued to deliver strong results from a core strategy of aligning long-term infrastructure replacement and enhancement programs with complementary, customer programs and rate design initiatives. For the quarter, Gas Distribution operating earnings increased to about $247 million compared to $237 million during the first quarter of 2010. Net revenues were up about $11 million, primarily reflecting regulatory and infrastructure programs. Operating expenses were up about $2 million due to increased depreciation driven by our elevated capital spend.","On the leadership front, I'm pleased to welcome Joe Hamrock to our team as Executive Vice President and Group CEO of Gas Distribution. Joe brings strong senior leadership experience to an already solid NGD management team. Joe and the team are executing on infrastructure projects that span our entire gas distribution service territory. These initiatives are part of a $4 billion-plus long-term investment program and when combined with complementary customer programs and regulatory treatment, they contributed to NGD's solid performance during the first quarter.","In Pennsylvania, the general assembly approved favorable legislation that supports our ongoing infrastructure modernization programs in the Commonwealth. The law authorizes the PUC to approve a distribution system improvement charge. The law also allows Pennsylvania utilities to base their rates on a forecasted test year, which allows for more timely recovery of infrastructure investments.","On the regulatory filing front, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed a base rate case with the Massachusetts DPU in mid-April. The case seeks increased revenues of about $29 million to support the company's expanded infrastructure, modernization and replacement plans and proposes to improve the timeliness of our investment recovery. We expect a decision on that case in late October. So across the board, our Gas Distribution company has continue to deliver innovating programs to customers and generate solid financial performance for shareholders.","Before wrapping up, I'd like to take a moment to reaffirm our 2012 earnings guidance and reiterate our core financial commitments. As I noted earlier, NiSource remains on track to deliver net operating earnings in line with our full year outlook, which is $1.40 to $1.50 per share non-GAAP. We're also proceeding with our robust and record $1.4 billion capital investment program. As I noted during our 2011 year-end earnings call, that enhanced capital investment plan reflects NiSource's broad and deepening inventory of accretive value-adding growth, modernization and environmental projects. We also continue to maintain our core financial commitments, including stable investment-grade credit ratings and a secure, attractive, growing dividend. On the credit rating front, during the first quarter, Standard & Poor's reaffirmed our BBB- stable credit rating that followed comparable action by Moody's and Fitch in the fourth quarter of 2011.","So to conclude as our first quarter report reflects the NiSource team is continuing to execute on our plan to deliver collaborative regulatory and commercial solutions, while making disciplined investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis. With our Board of Directors' full support and ever-increasing buy-in from our key stakeholders, I'm convinced that we have a compelling plan as well as the necessary resources and capabilities to deliver on our commitments and grow earnings north of 5% on a long-term sustainable basis. As always, we'll communicate with you and all of our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com.","Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Let's now open the call to questions. Grant?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It looks like the West Side project is a go. So that's $220 million of capital that we're kind of taking up incrementally on this call, right?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct. In-service, late 2014, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And I know it's early but can we expect the East Side project to be a similar capital magnitude?","Robert C. Skaggs","It'll be in that area code. We're sizing the project as we talk with potential counterparties and there's a possibility that it could come in north of that number.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And it sounds like you're pretty deep in discussions with your JV partner. There's one player in the Utica who's been in the news lately for not good reasons. Can you comment as to whether that could be a partner?","Robert C. Skaggs","It's -- that is not the counterparty that we're working with. We are working with someone that is widely recognized, widely respected. And I believe that you will see that counterparty quite well.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, what's your latest expectation of when you'll tap your forward equity sale?","Stephen P. Smith","We're looking to do that in the second half of the year, Paul. So we issued that in September of 2010, so we will tap that before that date.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Before September '12?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the potential project in Utica, liquids-rich portion of Utica. So I guess there's one counterparty you're working with, is it something where you're looking or would potentially get a long-term commitment and can talk about sort of types of return you would potentially see on the project? And the orientation of revenues, is it going to be more fee-based or is it something where you'd be willing to take a little bit of commodity exposure?","Robert C. Skaggs","Just to maybe begin at the back end of your questions. It would certainly be fee-based. The construction that we anticipate would be supported by a dedication of upwards of 100,000 acres. The investment would be made over a period of time as the production ramps up. The returns -- Steve just gave me a cue here on the returns. You may recall that we've talked between 12% and 15% pretax ROIC sorts of hurdle rates. And again, we would anticipate that this project will be consistent with that return profile.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And generally, a little color on how you see the landscape right now in that region in terms of competitiveness for projects, for labor, for materials?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. I would say that we still see an elevated level of activity throughout that wet window of the Utica. We also see a very competitive landscape in that area. We feel like our competitive edge is the acreage position that we bring to the table in the wet portion, as well as our pipeline right of way position in the area. For contractors, suppliers and the like, it too is competitive, but we've not seen what I would characterize as unreasonable spikes in costs.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of financing this, would you anticipate any other additional financing needs other than what capacity you have on -- for liquidity and obviously the forward equity sale?","Robert C. Skaggs","We feel like that, that will hold us for the foreseeable period.","Stephen P. Smith","Yes, and we're also planning to do a $500 million debt issuance in the latter half of 2012, which we spoke of on our annual call, February 1. So with that, the $500 million long-term debt issuance and the equity forward, we're in good shape.","Robert C. Skaggs","And Steve, you -- just to round out that answer, you may want to also mention that we do have maturities that get at the end of this year and early next year, so...","Stephen P. Smith","Right, we have a $315 million maturity in November and approximately $480 million maturity in February of 2013. So with the $500 million long-term debt issuance in the second half of the year, the equity draw, which we spoke of earlier, by September of 2012 and the residual benefits of bonus depreciation will be in good shape from a financing perspective.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And final on this, would you expect to be issuing a press release upon finding? And so when -- is that how we'll find out about this?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Last question from me, just update on customer discussions for the modernization project, how the discussions are going? What customers are saying and any sort of color there? And that's it for me.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. I would just repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, we're fully engaged in a series of discussions with a large stakeholder group. Those discussions are ongoing. As you can appreciate, I'm not in a position to provide color on those discussions. These are confidential negotiations, it's a process. We appreciate all the stakeholders' involvement, their good faith efforts to reach an agreement. So at this point, all I can talk to is process, it's ongoing. And again, the hope would be that we'd be in a position to file an agreement with the FERC by midyear, and we'd have FERC approval by year's end.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Kirst from BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Actually, just trying to follow-up on that last question, Bob. I understand there's very limited what you can say sort of on that timeline, and you just sort of alluded to a midyear filing. And I guess we're thinking June 30 here, which is not that far away. And so, as far as speaking to the process, is this something where you could say you might be in fairly advanced stages or is it still really even too soon to kind of call that?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, I'd say the process is ongoing, Carl. We began the exchanges late last year. They've continued on a steady schedule through the first quarter and the process continues.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I appreciate that. And maybe -- I don't know if this is -- any conversations apart from the Department of Transportation's comments that there's been any other conversation directly with the DOT, and what I'm wondering is, is that outside of a customer agreement, do you think DOT's comments in any way raises the possibility that the FERC would consider trackers in the normal course of rate making?","Robert C. Skaggs","Carl, I just don't know. I wouldn't want to speculate on where the FERC is headed at this point. In the past, they've used trackers on a limited basis. We certainly feel that programs of this size, this sort of commitment justify that sort of treatment, but I can't really speak beyond that, Carl.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I appreciate that. And then last question, if I could, just this is with respect to the eastern Ohio, I mean the Utica acreage JV here. And again, not so much trying to put the cart in front of the horse, but just trying to better understand when the comment is made about potential significant downstream infrastructure from the acreage dedication, are you guys -- because 100,000 acres is a nice size, are you thinking about this more of like a hub concept that would be replete with fractionation and NGL storage? Or is it more sort of the gathering, processing and then pipeline, we'll just go with that?","Robert C. Skaggs","More of the latter. At this point, it's more the latter. Now would this be a basis for something bigger in that window? It certainly could be an anchor or a key element of something bigger. But at this point, the JV would be more of what you talked, gathering, processing and the like.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Dobson from Wunderlich.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Hey, could we continue on the JV, and I think you were addressing this in one of your earlier questions, but can you just review with us again sort of how conceptually you're looking at this? It's -- as I sort of understand that it's you contributing your acreage in return for sort of a dedicated opportunity to develop the downstream or midstream infrastructure. So I guess, a, confirm that; and then, b, if that's the case then should we be thinking about sort of a like size however one wants to value Utica, your Utica a like-size amount investment in downstream that you'd be talking about?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, Jay, the concept would be that we will contribute roughly 15,000 acres that are associated with our Brinker Storage Field to the counterparty's acreage position. In total, the JV joint acreage would approximate 100,000 acres, give or take. We would participate in the development, it'd be a passive participation in the development, no cash out of hand, no cash to us. And then the JV would execute against all the downstream construction requirements.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And that's where your cash requirements would come in?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's exactly where the cash requirements would come in. And we're not in a position today to give you a clear sense on what that CapEx might be over time, but clearly it's going to be a function of a drilling program which we think will be aggressive. And clearly, there's expansive acreage involved in this deal and it's right in the heart of the wet window. So we're quite bullish on the opportunity.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. And appreciate you're in the short strokes of this, but just sort of what are the sort of main -- remaining issues, if you will? I mean, you've been working on this for a while. What are sort of the remaining issues?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. It's blocking and tackling and closing the deal out. I wouldn't characterize anything as a material major issue at this point.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. So as you said sort of 30 days, 4 weeks, somewhere in that timeframe, we ought to have an announcement.","Robert C. Skaggs","Both of us are being deliberate. Obviously, it's a significant marriage, it's a potential model for what we're going to do throughout the Utica. So we're just being deliberate and prudent as we go through the process and so are they.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","That's a good thing. They're always easier to get into than to get out of. Two other items, in industrial sales and I'm thinking both on the electric and the gas side, but from an economic perspective saw that your electric industrial sales were down, but gas industrial transportation up. And I'm sure that was in part driven by the low gas prices. But could you give us a little idea in light of those 2 items just sort of what you're seeing in the economy locally?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Just in the macro, we think the economy is performing relatively well throughout our service territory. We're certainly benefiting from the uptick in auto production, so our auto manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers, supporting industries, steel, everybody is doing reasonably well. If anything, a little bit ahead of the plan. Of course, our plan's always conservative. If you look at the electric industrial volumes, they are down a tad quarter-to-quarter, but they're up about 6% from the fourth quarter of 2011. So overall, they are certainly trending in the right direction. I also mentioned on the NIPSCO Electric side, notably industrial margins are up and that reflects the expiration of special contracts and the new rates. So I feel really good about the fundamentals when we look at NIPSCO Electric, industrial and R&C, and you'll notice the R&C volumes are up and NIPSCO Electric as well. On the gas side, again, it really goes back to the economy, auto manufacturing, low gas prices, albeit low margins. We're certainly encouraged by the throughput.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then 2 just detail questions. Sort of corporate and other had a nice swing in the quarter and just what drove that? And then I saw you did sort of restate and called it out in the press release in the third -- or sorry, first quarter of '11. I assume that $0.02 swing was just the accounting adjustment you had from a year ago?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct.","Stephen P. Smith","That's correct. That's the environmental write-up we took in the first quarter which we restated, so...","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then just corporate and other?","Stephen P. Smith","It's just cats and dogs, Jay. Nothing specific.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","But I guess, would it be of a nonrecurring nature? Should I assume something more like a modest drag? Is it more reasonable approach sort of quarters going forward as it normally has been or is something...","Stephen P. Smith","I would say that's a very reasonable assumption, a modest drag, as you said, going forward.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. I'd just put a little color on O&M across the board has been really well managed by the team. So just fundamentally, we feel good about the cost structure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman from MorningStar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","House Bill 1294, what is the timing on the Pennsylvania PUC addressing that? And when would your investment start?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, I'll go to the back end of the question. We continued to invest at a robust level in Pennsylvania. And so we've had that program underway now for, gosh, the better part of 4 years and the way we've been dealing with the investment is we've just filed a rate case every 12 to 18 months, and we'll continue to invest in PA going forward. On what they call now Act 11, Commission is working on rules. We're also in the midst of preparing a rate case to utilize the forward-looking test year. And during the latter part of the year, fourth quarter, so we're going to be filing a rate case to reflect the forward-looking test year.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you have been spending about $300 million a year in total through all your gas distribution modernization. Would this change that or is that still the number we should look for going forward?","Robert C. Skaggs","It's that number or potentially a little north of that number.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Driven by this Pennsylvania?","Robert C. Skaggs","No. Again, the Pennsylvania program is pretty well established. It may be elevated a bit more because of this program that all of our states now have robust, well consider accelerated infrastructure replacement programs in place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","At NIPSCO, I was wondering if you could give us a little color on how you guys are managing your coal burn and gas burn and what the impact of the lower coal prices and low gas prices are in your guys' fuel mix?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, not a material change in the way we're operating the coal fleet [ph] for Sugar Creek, our gas-fired generating plant. I would note or repeat that Sugar Creek's been dispatched way beyond our wildest imagination, and that's going on now for the better part of 2 years. So it's not quite running full time, but it is running on a consistent basis. Just because the way we're configured, and the way our system is set up, we're going to continue to rely a lot on the coal stations. And we really don't see a material change in the way they're operating.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. How are you managing your inventories? Are they pretty much at normal levels or would you say they're kind of elevated for the coal?","Robert C. Skaggs","I'd say they're relatively at normal levels. Again, not a material change in plan.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. As for Millennium, the equity earnings boost year-over-year, what drove that number up?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, we've increased the capacity. We've increased the deliveries on Millennium, so that's what you're seeing, great demand and improvements on the system.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Are those all firm contracts or is it kind of interruptible sort of demand?","Robert C. Skaggs","Firm, primarily.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And pardon me if I missed this, but on the West Side expansion, the ability to deliver volumes from north-central West Virginia to Pennsylvania, the west to the Gulf Coast market. How do the molecules actually physically get to the Gulf Coast markets?","Robert C. Skaggs","Part of our Columbia Gulf system will be bidirectional.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So meaning that people can -- you have to have the customer on both ends of the Columbia system pipeline? Are we just be able to swap gas at both ends?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Well, the gas will be physically move from north to south. It'll be a bidirectional leg of our 3-legged Columbia Gulf system.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on the Big Pine Gathering System, you indicated that's in the hydrocarbon-rich area of western Pennsylvania. What happens to the liquids out of that gathering system?","Robert C. Skaggs","A third-party processor will deal with the liquids.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Last question for me, in terms of the storage right now, where are you guys with gas storage in your facilities and how does that get cycled out as we go into the summer?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. It's cycled consistent with tariff requirements. So typically, customers by, gosh, I think it's April 1 need to be down to as low as 25% of their contracted capacity. This year, we provided a bit of relief and we gave them the ability to ratchet down only to 30%. So that's what we've done. No really material impact on our operations or revenues. This is fully contracted fee-based storage. But we did provide the customers a bit of flexibility in light of the much warmer than normal weather conditions.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And is that -- when does that -- when do you get down to 30%, when does that happen?","Robert C. Skaggs","April 1.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","On the 30% question there on the gas storage, so all the forced cycling is already complete, and at this point, the build is just going to be normal through the injection season? Is that...","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct. And just a little bit of color, for many customers, they weren't taking flowing gas from, gosh, December or early January, they were pulling from storage so they could get down to these ratchets, that we call them, by April 1. So again, they weren't buying any flowing supply, they were just pulling out of storage.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Understood. We saw some low spot prices back then.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, sure.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Bob, and I know you've kind of talked about this before, but maybe if you can kind of remind me on the longer-term MLP option, are you really thinking of that more as a capital funding issue when needed given your significantly expanding midstream and pipeline inventory? Or are you seeing it in your mind over time as more of a valuation differential question and one of a tax leakage versus the multiple?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, we consider, first and foremost, a financing -- potential financing vehicle. You alluded to tax leakage and other considerations, such as credit [ph]. Those are key considerations, but we'd certainly have to manage very thoughtfully if we elected to go with an MLP at some point. But we, first and foremost, think of in terms of financing.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","If this $4 billion of improvements in your system gets approved and goes live, are we -- is it reasonable to think that you can shoulder that comfortably with existing cash flows and balance sheet or could the MLP option come more into focus over the next couple of years as a result of that?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, we believe that we could certainly manage a $4 billion program that has customer support, FERC support and well-crafted recovery mechanisms. We think we can support that. I will say that we continue to study and MLP is an option, a tool that we might use in the future. And we continue to look at our ability to generate midstream projects, other pipeline growth projects on a consistent basis, see whether they might be amenable to a drop down and whether they might be better financed with a MLP sort of vehicle. So we continue to look at it, but it's not in active development mode at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It sounds like you're very close to resolution on the JV. And that's kind of, I guess, a validation of your business model to monetize your acreage. What's on the back burner in that effort?","Robert C. Skaggs","Sorry, Paul, you're going to have to give me a little more on that question.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It sounds like you committed about 15,000 acres.","Robert C. Skaggs","Correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You've still got a significant acreage position kind of...","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, I'm with you now. The vast majority of our acreage position is in that what I would call the far western oily part of the window or the oily window. And at the moment, we're going slow with that and being very deliberate. We're watching test drilling that we understand is underway by Devon and others, and we're going to get a better sense of what that position looks like before we proceed.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When's your next board meeting?","Robert C. Skaggs","Our annual meeting is on May 12, I believe. Help me here, 15? 15, I'm sorry, it's Tuesday, May 15.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, and there'll be a board meeting around that, obviously.","Robert C. Skaggs","Oh, yes. Yes, absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Dobson from Wunderlich.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Bob, just 3 quick questions. So the MLP, what -- as you consider that and I appreciate it's -- I think you are just saying not an active development. But what would be -- as I consider it and I share your belief that it's as much a financing decision as anything. Is it going to be the ratchet of CapEx that's going to drive you to make a decision, yay or nay on that, thinking of the $4 billion pipeline modernization or any of these things which it doesn't feel like any of those are sort of 2012 elements. So I guess I'm just trying to think, when would you -- do you think you'd make a decision on that?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, I think we need to see how predictable and sustainable our midstream business grows. So right now, we're trying to gather -- gain a foothold in the Utica. We continue to participate in the Marcellus. But to this point, it's been more sporadic as opposed to sustained. If we're successful in projects like the JV, greenfield projects in the Utica and the Marcellus, then we think an MLP consideration becomes more relevant.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. So it does sound like it's more like a '13-ish decision that would be driven by CapEx and other strategic decisions rather than anything in nearer term?","Robert C. Skaggs","Can't put a timeframe, I guess I would go back to team able to generate sustainable flow of projects in the midstream.","Stephen P. Smith","In the midstream, yes.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, in the midstream.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you, that's fair. And then on guidance, I mean obviously you put up a very nice, although weather-adjusted, nice first quarter results. How does it make you feel about guidance? I know you reaffirmed, but is there or is there an edge towards the higher end, the midpoint or something in that range as you sort of look out? And again, I fully appreciate it's pretty early in the year.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, just squarely within the range at this point.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then on the dividend, obviously, there's been a lot of chatter about what you may or may not do there, and I think your guidance comments were clearly to indicate your ongoing commitment to growing that. How should we think about that for the balance of '12?","Robert C. Skaggs","Stay tuned.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then last question, and I think you were talking about this, but what are your days of burned storage of coal right now?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yikes. We're going to have to -- we'll have Randy get back to you on that. I just couldn't give you a good answer this morning.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. But -- and I would definitely love to chat with Randy about it, but as you think about them relative to sort of the '09 timeframe, we're probably well inside of those record levels.","Robert C. Skaggs","Oh, gosh, Jay, I want to say yes. But again, to ensure that there's good, accurate answer, I'm going to have to ask Randy to get back to you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Edwards from Credit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Just -- most of my questions were answered. But just real quick, what was the driver behind the higher employee and admin costs in Electric business this quarter?","Stephen P. Smith","It's primarily about $3 million of payroll and about $5 million of higher benefit costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yves Siegel from Credit Suisse.","Yves Siegel - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups, number one, a couple of folks asked about the monetization program and the MLP. I don't see those as necessarily being connected, is that right?","Stephen P. Smith","We agree with that.","Yves Siegel - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the next couple of questions would be -- I'm absolutely convinced you guys will be able to come up with sustainable, predictable ongoing projects, so I'm a fan of the MLP idea. I guess that wasn't the question as much as an editorial. And the other is just housekeeping, can you just again remind me what your plans are for the pension funds as well as medical plan?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. On the medical plan, it's pay as you go, if you will. So we just deal with the expense on an annual basis. And like others, we've dealt with our medical plans with our employees and the like. So we feel good about how we're positioned on medical expense going forward.","Stephen P. Smith","And that's about $50 million a year, give or take.","Robert C. Skaggs","And the question on pension, just on funding, you'll recall last year, we accelerated our pension funding and we now stand at...","Stephen P. Smith","At 86% funded as of March 31.","Robert C. Skaggs","So right now, we're looking and considering what we'd do in 2011 -- 2012 -- I'm sorry, on funding.","Stephen P. Smith","But we have a lot of flexibility on pension funding for 2012.","Yves Siegel - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Because it looked like the number was pretty de minimis in the 10-K as it relates to what the contribution would be.","Stephen P. Smith","Right. That's correct. We always preserve the right to accelerate more contributions, should we elect to, based on what we're seeing in the marketplace.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. And the philosophy intent is -- we do want to be fully funded again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Kirst from BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two very quick follow-ups. And this is just on the West Side and the East Side project. As we look at sort of earnings going forward, is that something that would bleed in overtime via AFUDC or more sort of you'd feel that earnings once the projects are completed?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. My view is it's 2015 forward is when you're going to see the real impact. Otherwise, it's going to be, in the big scheme of things, immaterial.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. I appreciate that. And then the second question is -- and this just kind of speak to Big Pine and the returns on Big Pine because that was obviously legacy system, I believe, that you're adding on to. So are we going to be in a position to be earning at the higher end of that 12% to 15% kind of pretax ROIC or is that -- I didn't know if you could get market base rates on that or negotiated rates, or is that kind of just part of rate base, or how should we think of that?","Robert C. Skaggs","I would say initially it's going to be at the lower end and we're actively marketing that line to other producers. And as those producers come online, we could see the returns move north. But it will be over time.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.","Robert C. Skaggs","Grant, thanks so much. And for all the participants this morning, again, thank you for your interest and your strong support. We appreciate it. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes your conference for today. You may disconnect.

You'll see key takeaways from the quarter on Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning.","And with our continued strong performance, I'm pleased to reaffirm the enhanced earnings outlook we shared last quarter. We continue to expect NiSource to deliver 2014 earnings at the upper half of our non-GAAP earnings guidance range of $1.61 to $1.71. Fueling that performance is NiSource's steady execution on a broad array of stakeholder-focused infrastructure investment opportunities.","As noted on this slide, our teams remain solidly on track to complete a record $2.2 billion in capital investments during 2014. And those of you familiar with our Investor Day presentation will recall that we have now identified approximately $45 billion in expected long-term investment opportunities. This inventory translates into approximately $30 billion of investment opportunities in our regulated gas and electric utilities over the next 20-plus years and about $15 billion at Columbia Pipeline Group over the next 10 years.","Before handing off to Steve, I would quickly note that we are fully on track with our separation of NiSource into 2 highly focused energy infrastructure companies. Under that plan, NiSource will become a pure-play, fully regulated natural gas and electric utility, and Columbia Pipeline Group will become a pure-play natural gas pipeline, midstream and storage company. I won't rehash all of the separation details, but I do want to highlight a few key points: First, the transaction is expected to be tax-free and value creating. Second, both companies are expected to be investment-grade credits after the separation. And third, we expect to complete the transition in mid-2015.","As Randy mentioned, our planned master limited partnership, Columbia Pipeline Partners, filed a form S-1 registration with the SEC on September 29. All details of the planned MLP can be found in that form S-1.","Now let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our third quarter financial results on Page 4 of the supplemental slides.","Stephen P. Smith","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we're right on plan for the third quarter and on track to deliver year-end earnings at the upper half of our guidance range. We generated quarterly non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $46 million or $0.14 per share, which compares to about $57 million or $0.18 per share in 2013.","On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was down about $3 million when compared to the same period in 2013. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $32 million for the third quarter of 2014 versus about $50 million in 2013. At the segment level, you will see that each of our 3 core business units delivered solid financial results during the third quarter.","CPG delivered operating earnings of about $94 million compared to about $99 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $19 million, primarily due to growth projects placed into service. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $25 million, primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs and the current-period impact of a gain on the sale of storage assets in 2013.","NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $90 million in operating earnings compared to about $91 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers, were up about $12 million, primarily due to higher industrial and residential margins and increased environmental investment cost recovery. Operating expenses, again excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $12 million due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs and higher electric generation costs.","And finally, earnings for the quarter at our Gas Distribution business unit came in at about $1 million compared with a loss of about $1 million for 2013. Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers were up by nearly $17 million, primarily due to increases in regulatory and service programs. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $15 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs and higher depreciation as a result of increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower environmental costs. Overall, it was another solid quarter for the NiSource team and full details are available in our earnings release posted online this morning.","Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to quickly touch on our financing and liquidity highlights. As you can see, we retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $900 million of net available liquidity at the end of the third quarter. I'm also pleased to reiterate that our capital program for 2014 remains on track at about $2.2 billion.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Bob for an update on key initiatives in each of our business units. Bob?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Thanks, Steve. Before opening the call to your questions, I'll touch on a few key execution highlights, starting with CPG on Slide 6.","As we outlined at Investor Day, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in modernization and growth projects over the next 10 years, with most major projects currently in execution or in advanced stages of development. Earlier this month, CPG placed in service ahead of schedule and on budget, fully subscribed West Side Expansion project. With completion of this $200 million project, a portion of the Columbia Gulf System is now fully bidirectional in transporting Marcellus gas south to Gulf Coast and Southeast. CPG also placed in service the approximately $25 million Giles County project. This project supports conversion of a large end-user's coal boilers to natural gas.","Meanwhile, CPG teams are in full execution mode on several transformational growth projects. First and foremost, work is underway on the $1.75 billion Leach and Rayne XPress projects. These projects will create a major new pathway for delivering about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of shale production via the Columbia Transmission system, and 1 billion cubic feet per day via Columbia Gulf. Both projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2017.","The team is also advancing the WB XPress project, which is expected to provide another major pathway for delivering shale gas to market. As we outlined at Investor Day, the WB XPress is an approximately $870 million project to transport about 1.3 billion cubic feet of shale gas on the Columbia Transmission system to pipeline interconnects in the East Coast markets. The project includes capacity to support the Cove Point LNG terminal. We expect to clear the last remaining condition prior to year's end.","We're also quite encouraged by strong customer interest following the nonbinding open season for the Mountaineer XPress project. The project scope is currently being refined, and discussions with potential shippers are on a fast track.","I'd also note that CPG continues to execute on its landmark system modernization program. By the end of the year, the company will file with the FERC to recover costs for the second year of modernization investments. CPG will place about $330 million in system improvements in service by October 31 and anticipates cost recovery to begin in February 2015.","On the midstream front, the team is continuing to capitalize on CPG's strong asset position in the Marcellus and Utica regions. Our team started work on the $120 million Washington County Gathering project. The project will consist of gathering pipelines and compression facilities in Western Pennsylvania with an in-service date of late 2015.","The midstream team also is expanding and optimizing it's Big Pine Gathering System to support Marcellus Shale production in Western Pennsylvania. We're on track to invest about $65 million in enhancements, which will translate into about 175 million cubic feet per day of added capacity by the third quarter of 2015. So as you can see on all fronts, the CPG team is actively executing against a truly impressive and, indeed, transformational growth agenda.","And speaking of strong execution, let's shift next to our utility businesses starting with NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO is continuing to deliver on its business strategy with an inventory of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. During the third quarter, NIPSCO launched its 7-year natural gas modernization program, which is now expected to reach an investment level of $860 million, which complements the company's ongoing $1.1 billion electric system modernization program. Progress also continued on 2 major NIPSCO electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $0.5 billion from NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.","And last but not least, as we shared with you previously, NIPSCO is on plan with its 2 remain electric generating station scrubber projects. The second scrubber unit at Schahfer Station will be in service by the end of this year, and our Michigan City scrubber is on pace for completion by the end of 2015. These 2 projects are part of more than $850 million in environmental investments recently completed or planned in NIPSCO's generating facilities.","Turning to our gas distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large-scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary regulatory and customer program initiatives. Touching on a few highlights from the quarter.","In Pennsylvania, parties to our pending CPA rate case jointly submitted a settlement on September 5. The proposed settlement provides for recovery of infrastructure modernization investments and would increase annual revenues by about $33 million. Earlier this month, the administrative law judge issued a favorable recommendation to approve the settlement, notably without modification. We expect the final ruling by the Pennsylvania Commission by year's end.","In Virginia, we expect a decision during the first quarter of 2015 on Columbia Gas of Virginia's $25 million base rate case that was filed in April. And Columbia Gas of Massachusetts remains on track to file a priority pipe replacement plan with the Massachusetts DPU on October 31. Legislation authorizing accelerated recovery of gas infrastructure modernization investments took effect in Massachusetts earlier this year. Under its plan, CMA expects to begin recovery of 2015 infrastructure investments made under the program in May 2015. So as you can see, the NiSource gas distribution team continues to deliver steady solid progress on a $20 billion inventory of infrastructure opportunities spanning the next 20-plus years.","Let me wrap up by reiterating a few key points. First, we're steadily executing on our plan, and we're again reaffirming 2014 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Second, we have an unparalleled long-term infrastructure investment inventory, one that now approaches $45 billion. And third, we're well on our way towards successfully completing our recently announced separation that will result in the creation of 2 pure-play, highly focused and well-capitalized companies, premier companies that will be better positioned to execute on their distinct strategies and deliver enhanced long-term growth.","Once again, thanks for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Michelle, we're ready to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question we have comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. You indicate you're waiting on a legal ruling before you proceed with the MLP. Is that a PLR? Or is that more informal?","Stephen P. Smith","No. Paul, this is Steve. We're just going through the process with the SEC at this point. We're not waiting for any legal ruling or PLR. We don't need one to proceed with the MLP. It's just part of the registration process that we're going through with the SEC at this point.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then secondly, at the risk of drawing a bread box illusion, can you maybe kind of put a capital number around Mountaineer?","Robert C. Skaggs","It could be sizable, Paul. I think you can look at the potential volumes capacity that we're looking at and maybe as a proxy, look at the Rayne Leach or the WB XPress and I think that you would be circling around the so-called bread box.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's a pretty big bread box.","Robert C. Skaggs","And I would say, again, we're encouraged but as these projects go, we need to get across the finish line. So the team continues to work hard and stay tuned for more details.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Bob or Steve, can you remind me, on the 2 transmission projects that MISO had approved, were those MVP projects where the ROE was pretty much already set?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Well, then in the recent FERC Order here that FERC is going to hear the challenge to those ROEs, can that be modified? Are those set in stone? How does that work?","Robert C. Skaggs","Just a couple of observations. One, I believe that there is a notable decision on a PJM transmission ROE complaint, so we regard that as being instructive, not dispositive but instructive. And so we are now in process around the complaint that you refer to involving our projects. And so that's going to be a process at the FERC, could be litigated, could be settled. And again, clearly, we got some information from PJM that may or may not be relevant. To your question about the impact on our projects, yes, there could be an impact. I'm not practicing law here, but I believe that when the complaint -- the date of when the complaint filed is relevant and so there could be a reset back to that date and then going forward. I'd also observe this, that if you look at the returns on the project the way we have currently conceived or if you looked at other returns that are out there in the electric transmission world, these projects are very, very valuable. They're accretive. The economics work and so they're very attractive projects we think under virtually any reasonable circumstance.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. In terms of the West Side Expansion, when is that due to actually come online? I know it's fourth quarter but is that sort of reaching mechanical completion? Or...","Robert C. Skaggs","It's online.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is online now?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, yes.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Was that online as of, like, this month? Or was it -- that happened -- I guess I missed that. Was that August, September? Or was that...","Robert C. Skaggs","It was midmonth. It was due to be put online under the agreements here at the end of the month versus next month. So again, we were ahead of schedule and on budget for this project.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Is that flowing at a full 500 million cubic feet a day?","Robert C. Skaggs","We have to get back to you. I think it's on a ramp and will ramp up over a period of time. But we'll ask Randy to get you a sense of what's actually flowing.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That sounds good. On Rayne and Leach, so have you received all the permits required to begin construction on that? I thought that you had...","Robert C. Skaggs","No, we're just beginning the process and time elapsed, it's going to take about 3 years, give or take, to get this project from when we contract it to in the ground. So we're just at the beginning or early stages of that process.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So there's no phasing of it. It's all -- it will all sort of light up at the same time in the fourth quarter of '17 and so...","Robert C. Skaggs","I didn't really say that. Now there could be some phasing of transportation depending on what part we're talking about and when. So again, we can provide more color down the road when we get a little bit more detail on the project, but there could be opportunities for that.","Operator","Sir, you have no further questions at this time. [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Skaggs for closing remarks.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, thanks, Michelle. And to everyone, thanks again for your participation and interest. We look forward to seeing most, if not all of you, in a couple of weeks at EI [ph]. So again, thanks. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your day."],"15703":["NiSource Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Randy Hulen, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Randy Hulen","Thank you, Alex and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NiSource quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer.","The purpose of today's call is to review NiSource's financial performance for the third quarter of 2017, as well as provide an overall business update on our operations and our growth drivers. We'll then open the call up to your questions. We will be referring to our supplemental slides during this call. These slides are available on our website at nisource.com.","Before turning the call over to Joe, just a quick reminder that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","In addition to some of the statements made on this call can relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment and financial information which is also available on nisource.com. In that document, you'll also find our full financial schedules that have historically been available in our earnings release.","With all that out of the way, the call is now yours, Joe.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us.","NiSource continues to make progress on our customer focused business plan delivering on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives, and customer growth programs while enhancing our capabilities through transformation initiatives.","Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our achievements so far this year. We delivered third quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $0.07 compared to $0.06 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest an estimated $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in utility infrastructure this year with more than $1.3 billion invested through the third quarter.","These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long-term investment opportunities. The team's strong steady performance is creating value for our customers, communities and investors and we continue to expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings of a $1.17 to a $1.20 per share.","Additionally as we announced in this morning's press release, we're initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 per share. This range is anchored in the continued execution of our growth strategy and enhanced by our recent successful debt refinancing.","Moving to some highlights of our progress in the third quarter, in our gas segment we filed a base rate case in Indiana seeking our first base rate increase there in more than 25 years. In Maryland we received approval of our base rate case settlement and in Ohio we filed a settlement agreement in our pending application for a five year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure replacement program.","On the customer growth front, we've seen good results from our increased efforts and remain on track to achieving sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020. In our electric segment our latest electric modernization tracker update was approved and our proposed settlement related to the coal combustion residuals environmental upgrades remains pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Our electric transmission projects are on track and are expected to be in service in mid-2018.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?","Donald Brown","Thanks Joe, and good morning everyone.","Looking at Slide 4, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $23 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter compared with about $19 million or $0.06 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first nine months of 2017, our non-GAAP net operating earnings are up about $44 million or $0.12 per share compared with the same period in 2016.","The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcomes and established infrastructure trackers. As we discussed previously, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and aftermarket or ATM, equity issuance program.","During the third quarter we issued about 10.6 million shares receiving proceeds of about $281 million. Consistent with the financing plan outlined at Investor Day, this fulfills our 2017 plan to raise $200 million to $300 million in equity.","On the debt financing side, we issued $750 million and 30 year long-term note, at 3.95% in September. This is our second issuance this year at issuing $2 billion and 10 year and 30 year notes in May. The pricing of the notes this year has helped us establish new benchmark pricing for long dated note providing better clarity going for both NiSource and our investors as we expect to be in the market every year to fund our modernization program.","I would remind everyone that our debt and equity issuances are intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. In all expected financing cause, including equity dilution are included in our 2017 and 2018 earnings guidance, as well as our growth rate commitments through 2020.","Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment reported an operating loss of about $17 million in the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $5 million for the comparable period in 2016. Net revenues were up about $20 million driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. This increase revenue was more than offset by an approximately $43 million increase in operating expenses which I will touch on later.","Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of $129 million in the quarter, an increase of about $24 million from the comparable period of 2016. Net revenues were up about $34 million driven by new rates from base rate case and increased investment in a transmission projects. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by approximately $10 million increase in operating expenses.","As I mentioned previously, the plan 2017 increase in non-tracked O&M expenses is largely driven by commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, liability and customer service enhancements.","We're managing these expenses closely and we remain confident that our performance transformation plan will lead to flat O&M expenses following this year. Early success in our performance transformation plan has our IT service provider transitions well underway and work teams charge with identifying and implementing process improvement opportunities.","These opportunities will further integrate the NIPSCO and Colombia companies while enhancing value adding activities for our customers. Full details of our third quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.","Now turning to Slide 5, I would like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30 was about $8.7 billion of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.8%, which is more than 100 basis points lower and four years longer than at separation. This reduced cost to capital will help provide long term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.","At the end of third quarter we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. As always, we remain committed to maintaining investment grade credit and our ratings at the three major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+; Moody's at Baa2; and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook. Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investments and regulatory highlights.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks for that update Donald.","I'll start with the recognition NiSource's received in September for our sustainable business practices and performance. For the fourth straight year, we were named to the Dow Jones sustainability North America index and I'm proud to say we were the second highest ranked U.S. multi-utility on the list. Our ranking reflects advancements we made to our sustainability strategy in 2016 by outlining aggressive but achievable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions including mapping.","These reductions are enabled by the planned retirement of 50% of our coal-fired electric generation fleet and by our ongoing accelerated replacement of our natural gas distribution infrastructure. We're proud to be included in this index because of its recognition of our deep commitment to serving customers in a way that is safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and sustainable.","On the customer growth front, we're well ahead of where we were at the same point in 2016 which turned out to be our best year for customer growth in a decade. This progress is driven by a continued rebound in new home construction and conversions to natural gas keeping us on track to achieve sustainable 1% net annual growth by 2020.","And we continue to modernize training for our field operations employees. This month will open the third of our four new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in Chester Virginia. The first two are already operating one near Pittsburgh and one near Columbus and a facility in Massachusetts will open in 2018.","And I'd like to recognize our NIPSCO employees and our business partners in Indiana who stepped up to help restore power in Florida following Hurricane Irma in September. There's a long tradition of electric utilities helping each other following natural disasters and our team with more than 220 people including NIPSCO employees and line and 3 contractors headed south to help get energy flowing again to affected customers and communities.","Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter from our Gas Operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana we filed a gas base rate case which supports continued investments in system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. If approved as filed, new rates would be phased in and would increase annual revenues by nearly $144 million including amounts currently being recovered through various trackers.","An order is expected in the second half of 2018. In Ohio, we filed a settlement with stakeholders in our application for a five year extension of our infrastructure replacement program which remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. This well-established program currently authorized through the end of 2017 covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines. A final order is expected by the end of the year.","New rates went into effect last week in Maryland following Maryland Public Service Commission approval of the settlement in our base rate case. The outcome supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades and will result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million.","In Indiana, we're continuing to execute on our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. New rates under NIPSCO's semiannual tracker update took effect July 1. In late August we filed our latest semiannual tracker update covering approximately $58 million of investments that were made in the first half of 2017. The investments are designed to further improve system reliability and safety. Tracker updates are also pending in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia which combined include approximately $160 million of investments.","Before moving on from our gas business update, I want to highlight some improving results from the most recent J.D. Power Residential Natural Gas Study. Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as one of the nation's top gas only brands and ranked number two in the nation on customer service. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania were among the top five brands in the East and Columbia Gas of Ohio was number four in the Midwest. Our strong performance across the board demonstrates continued progress on our commitment to top-tier customer satisfaction.","Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. We continue to execute on our long-term electric infrastructure modernization program which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. And just yesterday we received IURC approval of our second semiannual tracker update request which covers about $133 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.","Our two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with the anticipated in-service dates in mid 2018. The 100 mile 345 KV and 65 mile 765 KV projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability.","Substation line and tower construction continues to progress for both projects. In our environmental settlement agreement seeking approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan city and Schaefer generating stations remains pending before the IURC.","The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of the year.","As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. For 2017 we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of a $1.17 to a $1.20 per share and to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments.","We remain on track to execute against our more than $30 billion in identified long-term investment opportunities. We are initiating 2018 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of a $1.26 to a $1.32 per share and 2018 capital investment guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.","With our robust investment plans, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020 while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource's. Now let's open the call to your question. Alex?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein","First question is on the 5% to 7% growth rate going forward. Can you clarify that that's good to be based on the new 2018 guidance at this point?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes, we continue reaffirming 5% to 7% year-on-year net operating earnings per share and dividend growth and that's as you know driven by our steady execution of our investment plans. It's predominantly the infrastructure modernization plans and so yes the new 2018 guidance continues that theme.","Michael Weinstein","And so 2019 would be based on the midpoint of 2018 theory?","Joseph Hamrock","That's correct.","Michael Weinstein","And I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little about the integrated resource plan at this point for NiSource electric and what the timing of that is - the new filing that\u2019s going to come next year and when do you think you might have to start planning and actually building or filing specific replacement plans?","Joseph Hamrock","So as you may know we await the IURC's final disposition of the last IRP and we look forward to engaging our stakeholders throughout the year ahead in a rigorous look at all of the replacement options for capacity in the future to replace the capacity we intend to retire. We have not yet determined an actual filing date for the next IRP in all likelihood it will be late next year or early 2019 but we continue to look at our options for how to step through those stakeholder engagement sessions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Turnure","Congratulations on continuing to really flex your balance sheet muscle here and capitalize on your regulatory constructs that you have in front of you with your 2018 plan and beyond. I wanted to ask about tax reform and specifically, the plan that we know of right now, as vague as it is, from the Republican Party back in September. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more detail or clarify any scenario analysis you've done around that? And follow-on to your comments from, I think, the fourth quarter call of this year?","Joseph Hamrock","Good morning Chris, and thanks for the comments. Certainly like everybody we\u2019re staying very engaged in the tax reform process ensuring that the interest of our customers and investors are balanced and that any unique implications for us are fully understood particularly related to the inclusion of interest deductibility and expensing of CapEx and transition rules all the issues we\u2019ve talked about before.","As you well know there's a lot of activity this week in Washington we\u2019re watching that closely too early to know what details maybe forthcoming, so I\u2019m not going to speculate about the implications of the current process just other than to say we\u2019ll stay engaged and keep stakeholders informed.","I\u2019ll ask Donald to talk just a little bit about what we've already said in terms of the potential implications of the frameworks we\u2019ve seen and then how we\u2019ll respond appropriately. Donald?","Donald Brown","As Joe said, we\u2019re paying attention we\u2019re looking at what's going on and certainly engaging with legislators to promote our plan and our strategy and the impact that may have on our customers. As we look at the potential impacts from the loss of interest deductibility and the 100% expensing of capital certainly has a negative impact on our plan but I think as we think about it, we\u2019ve got a number of levers to help mitigate any risks from that both in our capital plan in the past when we had 100% bonus depreciation. We have accelerated our modernization spend in our infrastructure trackers to help offset that lower rate base impact.","O&M certainly is a lever we have. We've already started our transformation efforts and have committed to flat own them after 2017 but that is another lever that we have that we can do items in short-term to help mitigate that and spread off any impact of - negative impact of tax reform.","And then finally we are financing, we typically financed long-term mostly 30 year debt and 10 year debt. And so certainly have flexibility to go shorter term to help smooth out any negative impact of tax reform.","So we\u2019re paying attention looking closely but certainly as everyone else's really want to understand what the details are of what may come out of tax reform.","Christopher Turnure","Yes, it's early but that's helpful color to know as an offset there. And then my second question is on the NIPSCO Gas filing in Indiana, could you just help me better understand the context there? You have the rider program, of course, that's been in place for a couple of years now. In the context of knowing that and the return kind of on-and-off capital that's coming on that, what else is this rate case doing for you? What do you have going on?","Joseph Hamrock","So that as we noted is the first base rate increase request in 25 years for NIPSCO for our gas business in Indiana. And so the backdrop there is a 1988 case that had an unusually high I might say depreciation rate led to a framework we settled in 2010 in a case we filed than to rebuild rate base through depreciation credit.","So this case reflects kind of a return to normal revenue requirements for the underlying rate base, as well as an update to O&M associated with as in all of our jurisdictions enhance safety in training programs across our gas business. So, pretty standard case other than the adjustment in depreciation in the underlying rate base.","Christopher Turnure","Do you feel like if it comes out the way that you are -- or hoping for, or base case scenario, there would be a meaningful change in your ability to earn your authorized ROE?","Joseph Hamrock","I'm not sure I go to meaningful change I think it's a pretty standard approach to shifting from what has been a unique depreciation model for the underlying rate base to a standard revenue requirements model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman","The 2018 guidance is obviously kind of midpoint to midpoint a little bit above your long-term kind of growth rate discussion. Maybe just give a little more - is that an annualization maybe of some of your financing savings, or just maybe give a little more color on what's driving that?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes, you got it Steve. We recognized the guidance range for 2018 is a bit higher and wider than the 5 to 7 primarily driven on the near term benefits of the refinancing. We executed this year and we've long ago noted that would stick in the plan in the near term here as we pulled forward some of the refinancing opportunities there. So that's the key driver.","Steve Fleishman","Okay great, not that I\u2019m complaining but and then on the - so you\u2019re done with your equity for this year and you still plan to do - some equity entirely for 2018\/2019?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes, that\u2019s right. We\u2019re done for this year consistent with our financing strategy that we outlined in ATM of $200 million to $300 million per year. Let me ask Donald to talk just a bit about our financing outlook for the future.","Donald Brown","As Joe said, we\u2019re still committed to the $200 million to $300 million annually through an ATM program. We are done this year and we\u2019re able to complete that in the third quarter. Additionally as you stated there is a drip program that\u2019s an additional about $60 million a year that will continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Paul Ridzon","Can you give a little more detail around what's one the operating earnings around the gas segment?","Joseph Hamrock","As you can see the O&M increases year-on-year through the third quarter in the gas segment, after you adjust for the trackers we\u2019re about 100 million. And that reflects all of the commitments we made in the base rate case cycle we went through a year ago enhanced investments and spending and training modernization some of our pipeline safety initiatives as well which set the stage for the flat O&M outlook that we talked about from 2017 forward.","So that's really the predominant driver there the steps we've taken in the last cycle to enhance some of our reliability safety and training spending.","Donald Brown","And also Paul, it brings up the third quarter from a gas perspective is our lowest revenue or margin quarter. And so there is little bit of just timing from a weather and sales standpoint there.","Paul Ridzon","I was surprised to see that big swing didn't really impact EPS that much. They're just other offsets throughout your business.","Joseph Hamrock","What do you mean in terms of the total quarter including electric?","Paul Ridzon","Yes, correct.","Joseph Hamrock","It's really when you look at year-to-date from a spending standpoint we\u2019re a little over 10% year-to-date on our spending and that's all in including our guidance and our plan on an total year standpoint we\u2019ll be a little above that range as well above 10%. So it\u2019s all in our expectations as we've made investments in customer service and customer growth in our transformation efforts this year. And I certainly expect and committed to driving those savings and opportunities after 2017 for flat O&M.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","I have two items one on request in Indiana the settlement outstanding on coal ash, that is included in your current environmental CapEx guidance or not I thought it was let me know if that's wrong. My second one is a follow-up on the NIPSCO gas rate case of the $140 million plus rate increase you've requested, how much of that would actually drop the bottom line versus the offset by the just simply moving revenue from trackers to base rates or higher cost by higher O&M or higher G&A?","Joseph Hamrock","On the CCR you're correct that's CapEx $193 million in the settlement is reflected on our outlook and has been so it\u2019s consistent with our CapEx of 1.6 to 1.8 through 2020 and its part of that outlook for 2018 as well.","On the NIPSCO gas side, a number of moving parts in there, but just sort of big crayon shorthand the best way to think about the answer to your question is about half of the case relates to non-O&M and non-tracked items is the cleanest way to think about that.","Michael Lapides","So in other words, $70ish million or so is kind of what will drop to the bottom line on a pretax basis I guess that would drop today EBT line or the net income before - the income before tax line. And the rest is either moving trackers around it would be offset by higher cost somewhere?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes give or take I would say that's a fair way to characterize the case.","Michael Lapides","Actually one last one on the Ohio extension request, is there any change in the range of spins being requested in the annual range of CapEx as part of that program or is that range staying the same as part of this request?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes there is - again is consistent with our CapEx guidance till 2020 that request for the next five year period beginning next year is about a $0.25 billion higher than the five year period were coming out. We are authorized up to $1.50 through the period that we're in right now and the request that we put in front of the commissions is for just about $1.3 billion and the settlement we found is on that order of magnitude close to that number.","Michael Lapides","So could that lead to an increase in your CapEx guidance or did you go ahead and baked that in before getting approval from the commission on this?","Joseph Hamrock","No, as I said that\u2019s consistent with our CapEx outlook through 2020 and beyond in that case you can see through past 2020 with that filing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman. Your line is open, from Morningstar.","Charles Fishman","Just make sure I understand this, some of your above 5% to 7% growth rate is financing driven and it looks like you significantly increased your long-term debt versus end of last year you\u2019ve gone out on the maturity, you driven down the interest rate. So really once we get pass this next year there is not too much more that can be done. And then we go back to the 5% to 7% I\u2019m thinking about that correctly?","Donald Brown","Yes, that\u2019s how I think of it that a lot of our higher performance this year is really on financing, somewhat earlier in the year, favorable settlement in base rate cases. But that is the primary driver for the higher guidance range in 2018. And then after that it really is around and that's why we remain committed to the 5% to 7% growth in earnings and dividends, it\u2019s really driven by our modernization efforts and our rate base growth.","We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities from a financing standpoint. I think we\u2019ve certainly still have debt that matures in the next few years when we refinance the debt in May, we only took out about half of that debt. So we\u2019ll continue to look to see if there's an opportunity to do that in a cost effective way, but primarily when you think about the earnings commitment it\u2019s the real driver is that that modernization program and the rate base growth impact.","Charles Fishman","And do you think you\u2019re a year about $8.7 billion of debt?","Donald Brown","We should be around in that range.","Charles Fishman","And then just one more question, the next time the board reviews a dividend it will be for the first quarter?","Donald Brown","That\u2019s correct.","Charles Fishman","That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Look forward to seeing you guys at EEI.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lasky from Citi. Your line is open.","Brian Lasky","What O&M assumption is in your 2018 guidance, we continue to guide towards flat O&M or do you see an opportunity to reduce that expense going forward?","Joseph Hamrock","No, Brian as we said consistently the outlook for 2018 is flat off of the 2017.","Brian Lasky","And then with a favorable outlook in NIPSCO rate case impact the equity issuance assumption raised for next year?","Donald Brown","It\u2019s too early to talk about that at this point I would expect that our plan is still $200 million to $300 million in equity. If you think about the program that $200 million to $300 million over time improves our credit metrics is especially our Moody's FFO the debt metrics until there's not likely any one item that changes our equity needs, but certainly each item contributes to our needs over time and we will continue to look at our plan and our needs to see if and when that would change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Chris Sighinolfi","Lots been asked, lots been answered appreciate all the color. I had just one follow-up and it's for Donald just looking at the cash flow it seems like there was a sizable pension contribution this quarter something on the order of like 315 million may be more than 300 million. I was just curious I guess two questions one I\u2019m seeing that correctly.","And then second if I am if I compare to what you had sort of outlined in the 10-K the contribution this year it\u2019s quite a bit more. So I was just curious there were something in the quarter conditionally that prompted that I\u2019m not intimately familiar with the finance what being related in terms of tax policy but goes ahead and changing on that front the prompt of the action just any clarification would be helpful?","Donald Brown","No absolutely and you were really quick to have pointed that out already. We did make a contribution of about $277 million to our pension. We did do it earlier than what was in our plan as we look that our forecast of pension contributions over the next few years looking at the increasing variable PBGC premium, as well as the interest rate forecast the increasing interest rate forecast.","We thought we had an opportunity to make a contribution now financed with a lower-cost debt that also de-risk the pension plan. So we went from about 83% funded to about 97% funded assuming we hit our assumed returns on our contributions we don't expect that will need to make contributions going forward.","And so it\u2019s favorable to cash flows of about $60 million over the next few years and certainly enhances our credit metrics going forward. So it\u2019s really an opportunistic opportunity to de-risk the plan safe from future contributions and ultimately have lower cost for our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Zhou from Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is open.","Andy Levi","It's Andy Levi. Just two questions, just in the quarter how much stock did you issue in the quarter?","Joseph Hamrock","10.6 million shares in the quarter.","Andy Levi","Oh really, 10.6 million shares, wow.","Joseph Hamrock","Including with our plan.","Andy Levi","No, I understand that you made weight on the stock so you did all of the third quarter so what you\u2019re saying?","Donald Brown","Yes, that's right Andy this is Donald .So we issued about 10.6 million shares the average price of about $26.67 so and we really had the opportunity where we had a couple investors that came in and wanted the opportunity to take a significant amount of the shares. And so that was we were able to execute on that at a good pricing for them and us and close out the program for the year.","Andy Levi","And then the other question I had just a follow-up on the tax reform question. So just to make sure I understood what you're saying you kind of outlined several different offsets and again we don't know what the plan is, but I guess just assuming a lower rate. I guess at the very least and there was interest deductibility having on the timings altered. It sounds like you feel that you can offset most of the impact of some type of tax reform as far as your earnings and obviously your growth rate?","Donald Brown","Well so I don't know exactly what that tax reform package looks like so I can't opine that I can offset all of it what I would say is we've got levers to mitigate the risk, but ultimately we got to find out what that plan looks like and what that impact would be to our plan and then we would make decisions on if we could offset all of it certainly have levers to mitigate some of that negative impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Paul Ridzon","Donald I had a follow-up what was your commentary around future pension contribution timing?","Donald Brown","So what I said was our expectation I\u2019m assuming that we only expected returns on our pension investments that we wouldn't make any additional make any additional contributions to our pension. We are about 97% funded at this point until if we hit our expected returns on the asset we have now in place we would not need to make future contributions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Hamrock, CEO.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks Alex. Thank you all again for participating today and for your ongoing interest in support of NiSource.

My name is Carissa, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed.","Glen L. Kettering","Thank you, Carissa, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of NiSource, I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations.","As you know, the focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 and to provide a business update. We'll then open the call to your questions.","At times during the call, we'll refer to the supplemental slides available on our website at nisource.com. I'd like to remind all of you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking.  ","These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. ","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Glen. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. For today's agenda, we'll review a few 2011 highlights that demonstrate the continued strength of NiSource's business strategy and our commitment to building shareholder value. We'll then spend some time discussing each of our 3 business units' performance. And before opening the line to your questions, we'll discuss our 2012 financial outlook and our strategic priorities.","Starting on Slide 3 in the supplemental deck, as we noted in this morning's earnings release, for NiSource, 2011 was a year of significant achievement, groundbreaking performance and industry-leading growth in delivering shareholder value. For the fifth year in a row, the NiSource team met its financial commitments. Specifically, in 2011, we delivered earnings of $1.35 per share non-GAAP at the top of our guidance range for the year, and I would add, right on top of the consensus estimate for the year.","We also delivered 40% total shareholder return, significantly outperforming the broader market in utility indices for the third consecutive year. In fact, NiSource's 2011 performance ranked first among all companies in the Dow Jones utility index.","Driving this consistent increase in value is our balanced strategy of executing on stakeholder-focused commercial and regulatory initiatives, paired with disciplined and accretive capital investments.","In 2011, those capital investments exceeded $1.1 billion. In a few moments, I'll provide a high-level overview of our $1.4 billion 2012 capital program. This record high program is a testament to our deep inventory of investment opportunities across each of our core business units and our solid financial foundation. I would suggest that the primary takeaway for 2011 is that the NiSource team has once again demonstrated its commitment, focus and solid execution, which has positioned us to step up our game a notch or 2 in 2012 as we continue to create value for our customers, investors and other key stakeholders.","With that backdrop, let's now take a closer look at our 2011 results, starting with our financial highlights on Slide 4.","As you can see, we delivered 2011 net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $378 million or $1.35 per share, compared to $1.22 per share in 2010. And our operating earnings for the year increased from about $915 million in 2010 to over $961 million. As I suggested earlier, these results reflect the core strength of our business plan, the focus of our team as well as continued signs of resilience in some of our key markets.","On a GAAP basis, our net operating earnings per share for the year were $1.08. As noted on Schedules 1 and 2 to our earnings release, the most significant GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling item was the $54 million call premium on our successful $250 million debt tender offer, which was completed in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our individual business unit results, let's start in Indiana with our electric business as summarized on Slide 5. For the year, NIPSCO electric reported operating earnings of $203 million compared to $217 million in 2010. Revenues were down about $0.5 million primarily due to decreased residential and commercial margins and lower environmental cost recovery. Operating expenses were up about $13 million primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses and outside service costs.","By far, the most significant highlight for the year was the settlement of NIPSCO's landmark electric rate case and the approval of that settlement by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, in December.","The near unanimous settlement approved by the IURC notably without modifications sets the stage for ongoing investments in customer service, reliability and environmental initiatives and positions NIPSCO for long-term earnings growth. This balanced outcome provides significant opportunities to continue building economic vitality and environmental sustainability in Northern Indiana.","Another recent development for NIPSCO is a significant growth project that's part of a multistate effort to strengthen the electric transmission system in the Midwest. The project includes an investment of approximately $270 million in a new 100-mile 345-kV transmission project in Northern Indiana. Scheduled to be in service during the latter part of the decade, it is 1 of 17 major new transmission system improvements authorized by the Midwest Independent System Operator or MISO.","On the environmental front, steady progress continued on significant environmental upgrades at NIPSCO's Schahfer generating station. That work remains on schedule and on budget. As you\u2019ll recall, the Schahfer improvements are part of the NIPSCO environmental investment stream of approximately $850 million over the next 6 to 8 years. Along with the significant customer programs launched in 2011, these projects are helping to strengthen system reliability, customer service, environmental and community quality, again, while providing stable earnings growth for NIPSCO.","On the customer front, I'd also note that NIPSCO continues to improve its J.D. Power ratings. Based on the most recent wave surveying residential and natural gas customers, NIPSCO is ahead of the Midwest average for overall customer satisfaction. Similar improvements have been made in the electric survey.","Let's now take a look at NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage, or NGT&S, operations that are highlighted on Slide 6. From a financial perspective, NGT&S generated operating earnings of about $360 million during 2011, compared to approximately $377 million in 2010. Notably, net revenues were up about $51 million, driven by a number of growth projects at NGT&S, as well as the impact of new rates under a Columbia Gulf base rate case settlement that became effective in May 2011. ","Operating expenses were up about $67 million in 2011 primarily due to our lower -- large pension contributions and increase in environmental reserve. On the heels of a solid year, NGT&S' CEO Jimmy Staton and team are intently focused on developing and deploying a robust comprehensive strategy for meeting customer needs and maximizing the value of our extensive pipeline and storage assets, including our very attractive position in the Marcellus and Utica shale production regions.","For 2012, we expect to invest about $430 million in NGT&S, a 43% increase over 2011. More than half of the program will be targeted at value-adding growth opportunities in and around the shale plays.","To that last point, the team is off to a great start. One unfolding project in NiSource midstream includes a $145 million investment in 90 miles of pipeline facilities in Western Pennsylvania. This project will have initial capacity of about 300,000 dekatherms per day and provide interconnects with multiple interstate pipelines. A definitive agreement with a major Marcellus producer is expected by the end of the first quarter. And work on the project, which is expected to be placed in service in late 2012, has already begun.","Millennium Pipeline also is progressing on plans to add more than 12,000 horsepower of compression to its system in Orange County, New York, responding to increased demand for transportation services driven by shale production.","Pending FERC approval, the new compressor station represents an investment of nearly $45 million for the partnership. The project, which is anticipated to be in service in November 2012, will increase Millennium's delivery capabilities at its interconnection with Algonquin Gas Transmission to 675,000 dekatherms per day. ","We're also making good progress on our work to define and leverage our mineral rights position in the Utica shale area. On our last quarterly call, I mentioned that we were engaged in an assessment of our storage leases in the Utica region to determine whether they would support potential production activities. That review has been completed and has confirmed our estimate of 100,000 to 200,000 prospective acres. ","As with the case for our Marcellus storage leases, we anticipate a ratification process will be undertaken to ensure the ability to use current drilling technology such as horizontal drilling on the Utica leases. Based on our previous experience, we don't expect that process to present any significant obstacles.","I also mentioned on our last call that an important part of the assessment process involves the definition of the Utica shale play from a geotechnical perspective. In that regard, while there has been limited drilling activity in Utica to date, most observers expect the pace to accelerate in 2012, especially in the so-called wet areas of the play. Needless to say, we'll be following this activity closely and will incorporate it into our overall mineral strategy.","In the near term, we're focused on our acreage in the eastern wet portion of the Utica. And as we speak, NGT&S is actively engaged in discussions with a number of parties regarding possible approaches and arrangements to optimize the value of our acreage position. We expect those discussions to mature over the coming months and, of course, we'll keep you updated as things develop.","With regard to our acreage moving westward into the play, we would expect our timing to correspond generally to the drilling development and delineation taking place in those areas.","Finally, I'd emphasize that as we develop our approach and options, our focus will be on the opportunities that enhance the long-term value of our assets and create sustainable shareholder value.","Before leaving NGT&S, I want to touch on one other potential opportunity, that's the possibility of a long-term system modernization program designed to enhance the reliability and flexibility of our Columbia Gas Transmission system, as well as to respond to anticipated regulatory requirements. We currently estimate that such a program could involve an investment of approximately $4 billion over a 10- to 15-year period. Similar to the modernization programs in place at our gas utilities, such a program could provide numerous customer, environmental and economic benefits while, at the same time, supporting ongoing rate base and earnings growth. ","More to come on this later this year as we continue initial discussions with our customers and other key stakeholders.","Let's now turn to our Gas Distribution group discussed on Slide 7. NiSource Gas Distribution operating earnings for the year were about $439 million, compared to about $343 million during 2010. Net revenues were up about $31 million in 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of our ongoing infrastructure investments and regulatory activity. ","Operating expenses were $65 million less than 2010, primarily as a result of depreciation reductions provided under the 2010 NIPSCO gas rate settlement.","Our NGD teams continue to execute on an industry-leading series of long-term infrastructure modernization and replacement programs. For 2011, we invested nearly $320 million in these programs to ensure safe and reliable service. In 2012, we'll continue at a similar pace as part of our $4 billion-plus modernization program.","On the regulatory front, as mentioned in our last update, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued a final order in Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case on October 14, authorizing an annual increase of $17 million. The commission also authorized a new residential rate design with a higher minimum monthly charge, including a fixed customer charge and usage allowance.","And a bit of an update on Pennsylvania House Bill 1294, which just last week unanimously passed the Senate as amended and is now back in the House. Passage is expected as early as the end of this month. ","And in November, Columbia Gas Virginia received regulatory approval of its application under Virginia\u2019s SAVE Act for accelerated recovery of certain infrastructure modernization investments. Over the next 5 years, we estimate that CGV will invest over $100 million under this program. ","On the customer front, our gas distribution companies continued to introduce and expand programs to help customers reduce energy usage and manage their monthly bills. ","In December, Columbia Gas of Ohio received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to extend and expand its broad array of energy efficiency programs. Over the life of the programs, customers will save up to $300 million.","Before wrapping up, I'd like to take a moment to touch on our financial profile and liquidity position. As I've discussed in the past, the foundation for our investment-driven growth platform across NiSource is a disciplined, well-executed financing strategy. ","Looking at Slide 8. In 2011, Steve Smith and his team further strengthened our financial profile through a series of strategic transactions designed to reduce financing cost, extend our debt maturity profile and manage liabilities, including in particular our pension. These transactions included issuing a total of $900 million of long-term notes, completing a $250 million debt tender offer, launching a $500 million commercial paper program and renewing our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility for an additional 4 years. These transactions also provide an opportunity to make a very cost-effective accelerated contribution to our pension plans to help manage future pension expenses. Our total pension contribution in 2011 was $400 million, which serves to place the plans on solid footing going forward.","We've also maintained a strong cash position, ending the year with $364 million in excess liquidity. Given this very strong liquidity position, and as we suggested on our last quarterly call, we don't plan to draw on our 2010 forward equity sale until the third quarter of 2012.","I'd also note that NiSource's stable investment-grade credit ratings were affirmed by Moody's and Fitch during the fourth quarter, and we expect to receive a similar report from Standard & Poor's in the near future.","Last but not least, a few comments on our 2012 earnings guidance and a bit more perspective on our record high 2012 capital program that's summarized on Slide 9. ","NiSource's non-GAAP earnings outlook for 2012 is $1.40 to $1.50 per share. The midpoint of the range represents a 7%-plus increase over our 2011 earnings. As I noted earlier, helping fuel this and future growth will be our record $1.4 billion capital investment program. That program includes investments of about $430 million at NGT&S, $530 million in our gas distribution business and $410 million at our NIPSCO electric business. Although the plan reflects an increased investment of almost 25% over 2011, the largest increases for 2012 are at NGT&S and our electric business, representing a broad and deepening array of accretive value-added growth and environmental projects.","These and other investments will serve to enhance the long-term value of our assets for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and other key stakeholders. As we continue to execute on our investment-driven business strategy, I can assure you that we'll remain true to our other core financial commitments: to preserve our stable investment-grade credit rating and to offer an attractive, secure and, in the not-too-distant future, growing dividend.","So as our 2011 results and 2012 outlook attest, the NiSource team is continuing to build on a strong track record of delivering collaborative, regulatory and commercial solutions while making disciplined investments that will grow earnings on a sustainable basis. With full support of our Board of Directors, I'm convinced we have a compelling game plan and the resources and capabilities to continue to look to deliver on our commitments, including our commitment to grow earnings at about 5% on a long-term sustainable basis. ","As always, we'll communicate with you and all of our stakeholders in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. ","Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. Carissa, we can now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A few questions. How many 10 3\/4 notes are left? Are they totally defeased?","Stephen P. Smith","No, they're not, Paul. This is Steve. There's approximately $100 million or so of those notes left.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what are the plans around those?","Stephen P. Smith","They're going to be held till maturity.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And your 2012 guidance, if we take '11 guidance midpoint to midpoint, that's 11.5% growth. How do you reconcile that with your advertised 2% to 5% objective?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, we've mentioned on several occasions, Paul, that we certainly expected a bump, a significant bump from the resolution of the NIPSCO electric rate case that goes into -- it has actually gone into effect. It will hit full run rate about the middle of this year. That establishes the new earnings base. And that from that point, assuming we invest at $1 billion plus, that will set the stage for ongoing growth at 5% a year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And the $1.4 billion of '12 CapEx, can you break that out into kind of growth versus maintenance?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's about 60-40. About 60%, 62% of that is growth, new business tracker driven, and the balance is traditional age and condition. That's a rough cut, Paul. It may cut a little bit more precise but roughly 60-40.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And when do you expect the $4 billion that you kind of unveiled today to start flowing?","Robert C. Skaggs","Just to make sure we're on same page, we mentioned $4 billion of inventory gas distribution, and that's the bare-steel replacement program, and that's 10 to 15 years. We also mentioned that we're beginning discussions with our stakeholders at Columbia Gas Transmission around a modernization program. We calibrate that to be about $4 billion. If we are able to reach an agreement with our customers or if we prefer the FERC rate case approach, we expect that spend to cover 10, 15 years. We expect the spend in around that program to begin in 2013.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","'13? And do you expect that this will be primarily negotiated? Or do you think you\u2019ll have to go with the FERC route?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, the NiSource approach is to collaborate with a broad group of stakeholders and strike a settlement, so that's the preferred approach. Obviously, the FERC rate case approach is also out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Maresca of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of things, first on NGT&S and then on Utica. So you have a big increase in CapEx this year, and you talked about intently focused on customer needs. And a couple of things, on the supplemental slides, you got $430 million of CapEx planned for '12 between the new Pennsylvania, Marcellus project, Millennium and Rimersburg, you kind of get to $200 million. So I guess, what makes up that GAAP of $194 million to $430 million plan? And then bigger picture, what are customers looking for right now in the Marcellus and Utica? And what do you think the size of this opportunity is, maybe over the next 2 to 3 years for you guys?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yikes, that's a lot of question. Let me give a shot at it, then we can fill in. You can just keep us on track. Let me go through the CapEx a little bit, and let me start with ongoing age and condition. For 2012, about $175 million is age and condition, so integrity, reliability, age and condition, so that's the base. On top of it, then you add the $145 million for the just announced Marcellus transmission project. You add on top of that the Millennium project and Rimersburg, and then the balance is growth that we will announce -- growth projects that we'll announce over the balance of the year. Okay? Then you also asked about what we're seeing in the marketplace and the Marcellus?","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Utica just...","Robert C. Skaggs","And Utica. We still see robust activity. And you've seen the recent producer discussions or announcements that they're going to focus on the wet. We're well positioned for that. Again, we continue to see quite a bit of demand. I think that the announcement we're making this morning is representative of the sort of demand we're seeing. It's in the wet region. It's gathering. It's processing. And as this project reflects, providing interconnections to as many outlets as possible, that's the sort of activity we're seeing. I also add that we mentioned this morning, discussions that we're having in the eastern portion of the Utica with parties that are interested in some of our acreage, but they too are interested not only in the acreage but the downstream investments in facilities to get that gas processed and to market. But that's the nature, that's the color of the sort of discussions and activity that we see in the marketplace.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, I mean, size-wise, I mean, you're spending $430 million this year. Do you think that's -- there's upside to that over -- on an annual basis?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. As I suggested, it maybe was more implicit than explicit, Jimmy Staton and team have developed, I think, a very, very robust strategy that's going to focus on leveraging our minerals position but also the footprint in and around both the Marcellus and the Utica. And I think you're seeing the beginning of that -- the execution of that strategy, but also suggest that they're looking at aggressively marketing the balance of the Columbia Gas Transmission and Columbia Gulf Facility, and you're going to see announcements evidencing the activity around expansions of those core systems. And then last but not least, we did suggest this. And I've answered Paul Ridzon, we're aggressively pursuing opportunities to modernize Columbia Gas Transmission. So long-winded answer, there\u2019s considerable upside to the spends that we're announcing today.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And my final one, thanks for more of the detail on the Utica. Can you discuss just the shape of these discussions that you said you're going on with certain parties in terms of how this possibly would be structured? What are the -- what's the other side of the table looking for and just a framework?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, I can only speak in generalities and appreciate the sensitive nature of all these discussions. Let me just give you our perspective, though. We have an acreage position. We'd like to exploit that acreage position. But frankly, we're interested in adding additional acreage that could be dedicated to downstream facilities that we would construct and operate. So again, we want to use our foothold to expand and garner additional production that can be supportive of downstream investments. So that's our emphasis. That's our primary focus as opposed to reaping upfront dollars, if you will. On the other side of the table, frankly, they want their gas to get to market. They want to get it as far downstream as they can. They want to ensure that the gas and the liquids will flow every single day, and that's their primary interest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","Can I just, Bob, just going from the growth rate that you enunciated this morning and confirmed, can we look at that growth rate going forward from the 2012 base on an average of like 5% over a 5-year time frame? Will that be right to look at it from that going forward from this year?","Robert C. Skaggs","That's correct. Consider 2012 as the base. And again, if we're able to sustain a CapEx program north of $1 billion, the CAGR ought to be 5% plus.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan of Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you guys touched on this, I think, in the past earnings call. But your operating expense and -- your operations and maintenance expenses at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operation is pretty high versus last year, and it was -- even on a quarterly basis and on a yearly basis too, so...","Robert C. Skaggs","Hey, can I interrupt you? I just want to caution you when you look at these numbers, you really need to drill down in the NGT&S operating expenses. I mentioned in the remarks that one of the key drivers comes from the pension contribution -- we made this accelerate pension contribution, and it hits the NGT&S pension expense because they're on a cash basis for rate making. So it's a $30 million-plus hit -- $36 million hit to their O&M.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that the -- in the quarter, in the fourth quarter, you had a $36 million hit from the contribution. You said it was a $250 million contribution to the pension plan.","Stephen P. Smith","That\u2019s correct.","Robert C. Skaggs","For the year, it was $400 million but...","Stephen P. Smith","Incrementally, it was $250 million.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. So you have that. You also would see an environmental reserve increase or hit that stems from a historic PCB cleanup settlement that we have with our customers and regulators. And that really is a onetime sort of hit because of that settlement and the need to ensure that we optimize that settlement.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And that was in the quarter too?","Stephen P. Smith","That was in third quarter.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And how much was that exactly?","Robert C. Skaggs","About $30 million.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","$30 million. Okay. So are we done with all these sort of onetime sort of items, or you expect this to continue on?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, clearly across all of NiSource, we've worked long and hard to deal with a vast array of issues. And we\u2019ve tried to address everything that was on the table and get as much behind us this year, and I include the NIPSCO regulatory situation in that basket. And so what clearly the intent is to just be as clean and efficient and growing as we possibly can in 2012 and beyond.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Are you guys fully funded now in your pension plan?","Stephen P. Smith","We're at about 82% as of year-end.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Do you guys anticipate any more contributions this year to your pension plan?","Stephen P. Smith","We're not anticipating any contributions in 2012 as a result of our accelerated contribution we made at the end of the year.","Robert C. Skaggs","Having said that, I would say Steve and team are opportunistic. So they\u2019re continuing to review the situation. So I would just caution you, as you look through the results, the fundamentals, the revenue and core cost fundamentals are rock solid for 2011, but you do need to look at some of these special items that I've mentioned.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, sure. And the $4 billion modernization plan at the pipeline business, is this mostly directed towards storage or the actual pipeline transportation infrastructure?","Robert C. Skaggs","It's the latter, so it's integrity, reliability, flexibility of the core system.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So these would all be sort of revenue-generating sort of enhancements, obviously, I mean, or would it be -- when you say\u2026","Robert C. Skaggs","Correct.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Now given -- if I look at your guys\u2019 sources and uses for cash this year, obviously, to fund your CapEx and maturity needs, some of that is coming from your equity forward sale. Is that correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","Correct.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As I think about your kind of CapEx funds going forward because if you had this $4 billion modernization plan, along with all the other growth projects you have, it seems that you're going to need some level of equity to fund some of these projects going forward. So the question becomes is, have you guys changed your sort of philosophy on the MLP?","Robert C. Skaggs","We've not changed our philosophy. We continue to look at it very closely. And obviously, if CapEx needs increase, we're going to look at all forms of funding of those needs. So it's still a relevant consideration but one that we're not inclined to go forward at this point. I would also suggest this, that in terms of equity, we believe that we're in good shape for the next several years, noted that we're going to delay the draw to the third quarter of this year on the forward equity. So I would suggest not jumping to any conclusions that we need equity quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst of BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A lot of my questions actually have been hit and touched on, but I would like to maybe just make sure I better understand a few things, and one actually, you were going over the pension expense. And Steve, I may have misheard this number, but did you say that in 2011, there was an incremental $250 million of pension expense over 2010?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes, we made a total of $400 million of contribution to the pension. The $250 million of that $400 million that we made in the fourth quarter was an accelerated contribution, not incremental. So we accelerated the contributions that we anticipated making in 2012. We accelerated those into the fourth quarter of 2011.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And so, is there -- within the 2012 versus 2011, is there a way to think of it in terms of O&M as far as the amount of pension expense in the actual O&M line that will not be recurring, just to make sure we're kind of expecting the right number?","Stephen P. Smith","What I would say is there's a lot of puts and takes around the pension. For example, our asset return in 2011 was flattish. The discount rate associated with the liability was 40 basis points lower than last year, so it went down to 4.6%. So there are headwinds coming at us as a result of the actuarial assumptions in the pension. And there will be a benefit. But in terms of the guidance range of $1.40 to $1.50, there are a lot of puts and takes for 2012. But within the context of the guidance range we've given you, we feel like we've managed any movement there or exposure around the pension assets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay.","Robert C. Skaggs","Carl, let me just add. I do believe that with this contribution and the way we've managed the fund in general that we have the expense level -- we've got a good handle on the expense level, not only for '12 but going forward. As you know, we continue on the rate regulated side of the house. We continue to try to use trackers, deferrals and the like to deal with any problems that might occur.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. No, I appreciate that. Second question, just, Bob, could you refresh my memory as far as the review on the Utica shale acreage? We're saying when the review is completed, we're still holding a range though of 100 to 200. Are there contingencies around why it's one number versus another number, and didn't know if you could refresh our memory as far as how much at this point you believe is in the wet window for instance?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, you really hit the nail on the head. The uncertainty of the geotechnical viability and attractiveness of the acreage that is in the oily portion of the play, that's where the uncertainty is. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing an increase in test drilling in that more oily window. We've read announcements of drilling activity in that window. But to really narrow that range, we need more definition in that portion of the play. And the majority of our acres tend to be in that portion of the play, Carl. So that's why the range relatively speaking is a bit large and will remain a bit large until we see additional information in that oily window.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's very helpful. And as far as what we know right now that's in the -- more of the NGL portion, is there a defined number of that on the eastern side?","Robert C. Skaggs","I'm not sure I got your question, Carl. Could you help me on that?","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Generally, I guess, I think of it as we're going east to the Utica, I guess, I'm thinking -- perhaps I'm on this, that it's going from oily to the NGLs on the eastern side. And I didn't know if that -- if there was -- well, I can come back offline, so no need to do that here. One last, if I could please, just back on the $4 billion potential modernization of the pipelines. And I guess, is there any indication that you have gotten from shippers at this point from a receptivity standpoint? Because, I guess, as I'm thinking about that, this would be a new model in the industry, would it not? I mean, we haven't really seen either tractors put on by FERC or something like this on a long-term basis. And I was hoping maybe that if there isn't any early color, what the sales pitch is, if you will, to anchor shippers to sign something that would be, perhaps, 10, 15 years in length.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes, very early in the process. As we get towards the middle of the year, I can give you more color. But I will say this: We recognize that the shippers need to see benefits from a program of this nature. So as you might expect, flexibility, reliability, integrity are the key elements of the program that we're asking them to consider. So that's the pitch, but a little bit too early to discuss receptivity. I just think intellectually, operationally, politically, however you may term it, I think there's a lot of appeal to the program. And I'd also add, many of these stakeholders are dealing with these sorts of issues downstream of the city gate. So they certainly understand where we're coming from and recognize the need. Now the challenge is to craft that balanced package that makes sense for them and for ourselves.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Yves Siegel of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Yves Siegel - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","If I could just circle back on a couple of things. Number one, on the Utica, you hear that acreage is going for $15,000 or more per acre, so I'm just trying to figure out how to try to handicap what the ultimate value could be to NiSource. And I appreciate the fact that you just said that you don't see an upfront payment, but you have these really large numbers out there, and I'm trying to figure out how big a game changer if it's going to be a game changer for you. Is there any way that maybe you could sort of help frame it for me again?","Robert C. Skaggs","Before I do that, I just want to be clear. I didn't mean to suggest that we're not interested in upfront payments. That's only one of the many considerations as we consider structuring deals. And so I just want to be clear, upfront payments could be part of the calculus as we structure deals going forward, not necessarily priority one for us, but it's clearly a key consideration. I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to help you on quantifying value per acre. We've seen the big blowout numbers. We've also seen numbers that are lower, and I would suggest it's going to be lease by lease, geographical window by geographical window to get precise numbers. Otherwise, I think it's going to be a swag for the time being. We do though -- having said that, we do believe this is a game changer for us in the industry in a lot of different respects. Number one, as we suggested, our acreage position we believe can be leveraged to add additional acreages for downstream projects. So we believe it's a foothold. We believe it's a foothold that can spawn significant downstream in investment. Again, I can't help you quantify that, but if you look at the potential volumes that we're talking about and the need for processing and takeaway capacity, it's a game changer. It's a game changer for us, for Dominion, for other people that have a significant footprint in the area. I also suggested earlier that downstream on our core system that we believe there are significant opportunities because of this gas supply region developing right in the heart of our system. Again, I can't help you on quantification, but we know that we're going to have -- you take the estimate, 13 BCF a day potentially. When this is built out, maybe even north of that, hitting the systems, hitting our system and others, it's going to have to go somewhere. Certainly implies a significant amount of downstream capacity expansions and reconfiguration. Sorry, I can't be more definitive, but I would suggest you need to look beyond just the dollars per acre sort of calculation to what does it imply for the facility expansions downstream.","Yves Siegel - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And to the last point, would a lot of that infrastructure be out of rate base? Or would it be tangential to your...","Robert C. Skaggs","We believe it can be both. Further you go downstream, the more likely it could be both. The closer to the wellhead, certainly, it's going to be predominantly, if not entirely, producer supported.","Yves Siegel - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, going back to the one of the earlier questions, when you think about cash flow and financing, do you have a rough ballpark of what you think deferred taxes will look like in 2012?","Stephen P. Smith","Well, as we've said -- this is Steve. We've said that the benefits from the legislation that was passed not too long ago, that we would see an excess of $500 million of deferred tax benefit. So that is going to come to us over the next couple of years. We'll also get tax deductibility from the pension contributions made in 2011 as well, so fairly healthy deferred tax benefits over the next several years.","Yves Siegel - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. And my last question is just sort of getting back to the thought of financing all of this growth. What is the thought process in terms of -- when you think of the amount of spending, is it thought that 2012 -- well, I guess, the way to maybe ask it, the $430 million that you've identified thus far in the transportation segment, could that be substantially different moving forward, or any sort of project announcements will probably hit more in the 2013 and beyond time frame?","Robert C. Skaggs","My sense is that it is in the 2013 and beyond. And what we\u2019ve attempted to suggest is that the number that we announced today, the CapEx number, could go up, but it is going to be dependent on the development of projects, be it midstream projects or what I'm calling downstream projects. And another key variable, if you will, is how do we proceed on the modernization of Columbia Gas Transmission. So those are the key sensitivities that toggle the $1.4 billion that we announced today, toggles it up or toggles it down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Drill down one more time on Utica, and just really a question on timing. Obviously, you've got ongoing discussions, and I'm sure these have a fluidity of nature to them. When do you think you'd have something to announce?","Robert C. Skaggs","Related to the discussions we're having now in the eastern portion of the Utica, I think we're in a window that could be 60 to 90 days. I think it's that quick. We've been at it for a while. And certainly, we'd like to reach closure sooner versus later. Having said that, we don't have a clock ticking. We just want to structure a good deal. And the western portion of the Utica, as I've suggested, it's going to take more time to develop. And we are going to be dependent on what producers and developers do in that region to give you more definition.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Right, right, right, exactly. Okay. That's perfect. And similar on the NGT&S modernization, I think, in response to an earlier question, you sort of said more info later this year. Is that -- and maybe confirm that for me, but then also, is that the outgrowth of your discussion with shippers? It seems like awfully fast timing actually for something that would be potentially this large.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Well, I've suggested midyear for more definition. In certain respects, albeit groundbreaking, these discussions are relatively straightforward. I think folks have a good understanding of what the dimensions of the [indiscernible] might be. And so from that point, again, the issues tend to narrow, not to suggest it's easy or without complication, because it is. We think those discussions can move at a relatively decent pace, and we can have a degree of clarity on whether we have a program or whether we don't by midyear. If we don't, then we have to consider our other FERC options. So again, we're going to move with relative dispatch on this one.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's great. And then switching to financing outside of the equity forward, which expires in September, so it sounds like you\u2019ll close that out at the end of the third quarter. So what else do we need to do this year? I know we\u2019ve got a maturity in the fourth quarter or so. But what else given the $1.4 billion of CapEx do we need to do outside of the equity forward?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes, all we have planned, Jay, is the $500 million debt offering in the latter half of 2012. And again, we continue to like the longer end of the curve based on what we're seeing.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Sure. Who wouldn't? Speaking on that topic, any more on the liability management front? I mean, I know these things are always somewhat fluid and has as much to do with who holds your debt as anything else, but any more on that opportunity?","Stephen P. Smith","Yes, I mean, I would say we've been pretty successful over the last couple of years, putting out some long-term paper, and our weighted average life of our debt portfolio is now approaching 9-plus years. We feel pretty good about that.","Robert C. Skaggs","It's remarkable\u2026","Stephen P. Smith","And our weighted average cost of our debt portfolio was around 6%. And we feel like we've made some good progress.","Robert C. Skaggs","Made some really good progress.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","No, that's fantastic. And the last one, Bob, you mentioned the dividend. And I think when I went back to the transcript from the third quarter, you might have given some folks some head fakes around dividend which caused people to maybe react a little bit when a couple of days ago, you announced a flat dividend. So maybe if you would, just help folks frame that. I'm not asking for exactly when you're going to do it. But certainly, given a $1.4 billion CapEx, all of this CapEx in front of you, there's a bit of a balancing act you and the board have to go through to say, what are we going to do on the dividend versus what are we going to do. And maybe if you could, think of that in the context of the long-term earnings growth rate you've advertised in that 5% range.","Robert C. Skaggs","Yes. Around the dividend growth, I mentioned that the predicate to that was really twofold. Number one was we needed to work our way through the NIPSCO electric rate case and resolution of that case. We can check off that box for December. The other key predicate was we needed to grow into a reasonable payout ratio. And with the outlook we've given you this year, we are, in fact, I think, in a reasonable payout window. So literally, what the board is doing, and they kicked off this process last year, they're considering where to head on the dividend. And as you might guess, management has suggested that an appropriate payout policy would be between 60% and 70%. I've mentioned that before. So the board is considering policy. They're considering initial amount in the growth rate for the dividend, and they're considering timing. Not only when we might do it this year, but when we might do it every year after this year. So that's what the board is considering. They're engaged in a process that will be, frankly, a brisk process. This isn\u2019t a 12-month study sort of process. So I would suggest that it's on the docket. It's being actively considered. And you know what management's bias, and I would say the board's bias is, we want to begin growing the dividend ASAP, so stay tuned, second half of this year.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. But since you're in that 60% to 70% payout, we ought to be thinking about that 5% long-term growth rate, which although it seems like it's going faster, near term, it's...","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, I would suggest this: the EPS growth rate of 5%. A dividend growth rate might be a bit south of that, but it would certainly be a strong, let's say, robust dividend growth rate. That's where I would expect the board to go. Let me just add, the board and management understands and we believe that a good growing strong dividend is a significant part of our value proposition. So it's front and center. It's on the docket.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi of Caris.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Most of the questions were asked. Just 2 real quick ones on the Utica though. I guess, one\u2019s kind of a follow-up from Carl Kirst's question, and I don't know if you're going to be able to provide this. But is there any type of a percent breakdown on the acreage as far as east versus west?","Robert C. Skaggs","The vast majority is west.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But so is that over 60%, 70%, or you just don\u2019t want to go more than that?","Robert C. Skaggs","It's in the zip code that you mentioned. And let me though be clear, central and west.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Central and west.","Robert C. Skaggs","Central and west. And if you just look at that map, we're in that central and western portion, and it's married with our storage positions.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how far is that acreage from, let's say, Chesapeake's announced well results recently in Caroll County?","Robert C. Skaggs","We have one pocket that's in that region, broadly defined region. And then, again, the majority of the acreage is west of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Becca Followill of U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Following up on the pipeline modernization program. You guys are really the first to announce a big program like this. And there's a trade-off between maintaining the competitive system and competitive pricing versus the modernization program. Can you do this in isolation without the rest of the industry doing a program? Or do you need the whole industry to say we're all going to modernize our systems?","Robert C. Skaggs","We believe we can do this without the entire industry necessarily following or doing it in tandem. And just to kind of your lead-in point, Columbia Gas Transmission is very competitive from a rate perspective today. And we believe with modernization, it is very, very, very competitive in that mode as well. We don't see it as a competitive threat. In fact, we would suggest that with improved integrity, reliability and flexibility, the competitive position's enhanced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spratt of Miller Howard Investments.","Bryan Joseph Spratt - Miller Howard Investments, Inc.","Back to the mineral rights and trying to monetize them, which entity actually owns the title to the leaseholds? And if you were able to monetize or form a deal, does the parent get the full benefit? Or is there some regulatory offset or give back?","Robert C. Skaggs","The rights are in a NiSource company called NiSource Energy Ventures Company. And it's part of, if you will, NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage, or at least, it\u2019s associated with NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage. By the way, bear with my legal, technical discussion of this. I may be off a bit, but directionally, that's how it's structured, and it's not part of the regulated entities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Golden of JPMorgan.","Josh Golden","There's a lot of discussion about increased capital expenditures, potential growing the dividend. And to be frank about it, the balance sheet has not had a material improvement in the actual amount of debt. I understand the tender offers and the rescheduling of the maturity profiles. And from my perspective, that is necessary given your liquidity profile. But you are still a low BBB credit, and the bonds -- your credit within the capital markets trades almost like a junk bond, BB rate of credit. So given the nature of the discussion of the increased CapEx, potentially growing the dividend, putting that \"on the docket,\" can you offer some type of commentary to your fixed income bondholders about, one, maintaining an investment-grade rating, actually improving the balance sheet and trying to work up from a low investment-grade rating? And I would like to point out, your credit rating for a company such as yourself, such as a C corp, being a distributor and pipeline, it is one of the lower credit rating within your peer set. So can you address those concerns?","Robert C. Skaggs","Sure. I appreciate the comments, and I've got to start out with a comment that I make whenever I meet with any investor or debt holder, that our commitment to investment-grade credit ratings is sacrosanct, unquestioned, unconditional. We are absolutely 100% committed to that. We've demonstrated that over the past 7 years that we will do whatever it takes to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. We mentioned also in our comments today that the credit rating agencies recently reviewed our 5-year plan. And as you would expect, they looked at elements such as CapEx. They looked at elements such as dividend growth. And I think if you closely read those reports, they feel very good about the business. I'd also say the credit rating agencies recognized that we're balancing, maintaining this investment-grade credit rating as well as addressing our business opportunities, be it growth, be it requirements to deal with age and condition, reliability and integrity. And I think they've endorsed our project, appropriately balancing all of those key considerations. I'll also mention what credit rating agencies and, for that matter, debt holders have talked to us about, is how your cash metrics look. And I would suggest, I would maintain that over the past 7 years, there has been material improvement in the key cash metrics that the rating agencies have been looking at. So I feel good where we're at on our credit profile. I think it's an appropriate balance of maintaining an investment-grade credit rating while dealing with opportunities and the needs of the business, and we're 100% committed. Last but not least, I recognize that this plan is not a debt paydown plan. This is a plan to, again, take advantage of opportunities, to improve the underlying business and ensure that those cash metrics are strong and improving. And so the goal is we want to be a strong, BBB- credit rating. We think that's the correct fit for us, and that's the objective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I had a quick follow-up. Part of the value proposition is that you're very well positioned to touch these hydrocarbon molecules many times. Can you kind of just give an overview of how many times you think you can touch them and get paid for doing it?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, we'd like to touch it at the wellhead, as it comes out of the wet head. So we want to gather it. When appropriate, we want to process it. We also want to, if possible, touch the liquids. And then certainly, we want to touch the molecules downstream, not only on our core Columbia Gas Transmission system but also at the gas distribution level. So that's the philosophy, just optimize the value chain, touch the molecules and ensure that we're playing in the region. We may also want to take the opportunity to, though, add: We're attempting to deepen the growth inventory across all the business units. So I hope it's not lost on folks that when you look at NIPSCO, for example, it has a strong environmental investment portfolio, but we believe it too has a modernization portfolio, flexibility portfolio and core growth portfolio. So we're looking at those key elements across all the business units.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what is your opportunity on the processing site?","Robert C. Skaggs","Well, we believe that particularly, as you look at the Utica, all these wet plays are going to require processing. We believe we have an opportunity to do it ourselves, or we believe we have the opportunity to partner with others to provide that service.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Would that require capital investment for you to do it?","Robert C. Skaggs","Sure. Oh, yes, absolutely. Anytime we play or touch the molecule, more than likely, we're going to require capital to provide the facilities to do it.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob Skaggs for closing remarks.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thank you, Carissa. And again, thank you all for your interest.

Joining me today are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer.","The purpose of this presentation which has slides available on nisource.com is to review NiSource's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2018, as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. Following our presentation, we'll open the call to your questions.","Before turning the floor over to Joe and Donald, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward looking.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2018 was one of the most challenging years in NiSource's history. Recovery from the tragic event in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts area has been our major focus since September 13th. Additionally, 2018 was a year of continued execution on our core business plan across our entire service footprint, which I'll touch on later.","First, I'd like to provide a progress report on our continued recovery efforts in the Merrimack Valley. I am deeply grateful for the dedication of the thousands of people who came together to carry out our restoration efforts. And for the resilience and spirit of the people of the Merrimack Valley, who have been tremendously gracious to all those who came to aid in the restoration. We reached a major milestone in mid-December with gas service restored to nearly all customers. And our focus on supporting our customers in those communities continues. Once gas service was restored, we immediately moved into phase two of the effort with long-term commitments to restoring property in streets and continued engagement with the Greater Lawrence community. We continue to have resources in the area to provide support and services to customers in the three municipalities. And we put in place a new leadership team dedicated to support our ongoing restoration efforts. We remain humbled by the events and we're engaged in extensive efforts to further enhance the safety and reliability of our gas distribution systems, not only in Massachusetts but across our seven states footprint.","As I mentioned on our third quarter call, we have committed to install over pressurization protection, automatic shut-off devices on every low-pressure system across our seven state operating area. These devices operate like circuit breakers. They are designed so that when the sensor operating pressure that is too high or too low, they immediately shut down gas to the system regardless of the cause. We've started installing these systems and this work initially estimated at a $150 million is a top priority. We've also committed to adding additional remote monitoring capabilities on all low-pressure systems. These will allow us to see more comprehensive details on how our systems perform and will alert us immediately in the event of abnormal system performance. By integrating these advanced tools, our team will have a more precise view into the current status of our system, allowing employees in our gas control center to better coordinate with employees in the field and enabling us to respond more quickly in the event of any irregular system activity.","As part of our continuing damage prevention efforts, we further enhanced our damage prevention practices around low-pressure regulator stations, including field inspection and monitoring of third-party excavators. These enhanced work practices were implemented across all of our states by the end of 2018 to help reduce the risk of facility damage. And we took other steps immediately following the September 13th event, including a field survey of all low-pressure regulator systems to identify all options to enhance safe; reliable operation and engineering design review of all regulator stations; and the addition of new details to our electronic mapping systems, which is easily accessible to all our field and engineering employees.","Our efforts to guard against future incidents extends beyond the work we're doing with our low-pressure systems. We're accelerating implementation of the safety management system or SMS across our seven states. Safety management systems have been used successfully by the airline industry to achieve a continued decrease in accidents despite a significant increase in flight hours since the 1990s. Our SMS is aligned with the framework developed for pipeline operators by the American Petroleum Institute. This framework helps identify and manage risks, communicate with stakeholders, ensure effective operation of key processes, promote a learning environment and continuously improve pipeline safety and integrity.","We launched SMS in Virginia and Indiana well before the Lawrence incident and we since accelerated its implementation across the NiSource footprint. The scope of our SMS deployment is substantial. We have assembled a cross functional team of employees across NiSource with consultants and advisors who provide expertise and safety management systems in the gas industry and other industries. Hundreds of people are involved and we have appointed a Senior Executive to a new position dedicated to SMS implementation. We're also standing-up a quality review board to provide independent review of our SMS implementation.","The board will include highly experienced professionals from diverse backgrounds in gas operations and other industries, including aviation and nuclear generation. We expect to announce the members of the quality review board, as well as additional details about our SMS implementation in the coming weeks.","Let's now turn to Slide three, which outlines some of the ways NiSource delivered on key objectives in 2018. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings were $1.30 per share for the year versus $1.21 in 2017, which was in the top half of our 2018 guidance range. We began repositioning our Indiana electric business with submission of a long-term plan to transition our generating fleet away from coal to lower cost renewable energy resources beginning in 2023 and becoming call free by 2028, saving customers an estimated $4 billion over the long-term.","We invested $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018, including accelerated mainline replacement in the Greater Lawrence. NiSource replaced more than 430 miles of natural gas pipelines, including 302 miles of priority pipe, as well as 64 miles of underground electric cables and more than 1,300 electric poles to enhance system safety and reliability. We added approximately 27,000 net new gas customers, driven by increased convergence to natural gas from other fuels and healthy housing markets. We successfully implemented Federal Tax reform with all customers now enjoying savings made possible by lower corporate income tax rates.","Our state-of-the-art training centers opened in Massachusetts and Virginia completing the four centers we announced in 2016, and enhancing training for our gas operations employees and local first responders. A new capital expenditures program rider was approved in Ohio, allowing for cost recovery to begin on significant capital investments not being recovered through the existing infrastructure modernization tracker. And our team continued its solid execution of regulatory initiatives, including gas base rate case settlements in Indiana, Maryland and Pennsylvania, and filing a gas base rate case in Virginia and an electric base rate case in Indiana. As you can see, NiSource continued to execute on planned investments and initiatives in 2018, and we're taking prudent steps to ensure the sustainability of our business for years to come.","Turning our focus to 2019, we're initiating non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance at $1.27 to $1.33 per share for the year, and we expect to make $1.6 to $1.7 billion in capital investments. Our 2019 earnings guidance, which falls short of our long-term earnings growth forecast, reflects the near-term impact of financing the Greater Lawrence restoration, expenses associated with accelerating the enterprise wide SMS implementation and increased pension costs related to market volatility in late 2018.","From 2019 forward, we expect to grow our non-GAAP earnings and dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2022, a two year extension of our prior long-term growth forecast. We expect to make capital investments of $1.6 billion to $2 billion annually from 2020 through 2022. We're confident our resilient infrastructure investment programs will continue to deliver value for all our stakeholders with safety enhancements to our customers and communities and long-term financial growth for investors.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?","Donald Brown","Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. Before talking about our non-GAAP earnings, I just like to note that our 2018 GAAP results include our emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with the Greater Lawrence incident. Additionally, our current total estimates are significantly higher than estimates we provided with our third quarter results. We now estimate the total expense related to the greater Lawrence incident is approximately $1.1 billion. We also estimate $220 to $230 million in capital costs related to the distribution system replacement and associated restoration in the impacted communities.","I would note that the prior estimates we provided were compiled in the early weeks after the incident before the complexity of the in-home restoration process was fully known. With service restored to substantially all customers in mid-December, we believe a bulk of the restoration costs are behind us. We have $800 million of casualty insurance coverage and $300 million of property insurance that we expect will recover a substantial portion of these costs. We started submitting claims in December and have recorded insurance recoveries of $135 million, which includes $5 million already collected during 2018. ","As insurance recovery process moves forward, we plan to provide quarterly updates on our progress. More details of our current estimates are available on Slide 12, as well as schedule two of our earnings press release.","Looking at our 2018 results on Slide 4, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $463 million or $1.30 per share compared with about $398 million or $1.21 per share in 2017. The biggest driver of our financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by constructive regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.","Let's turn now to non-GAAP financial results for our business segments. Looking at Slide 6, our gas distribution and operations segment had operating earnings of about $565 million for 2018 compared with about $591 million in 2017. Operating earnings excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform were about $84 million more than a year, driven primarily by regulatory outcomes.","Our electric operations segment, covered on Slide 7, reported operating earnings of about $369 million for 2018 compared with operating earnings of about $379 million in 2017. However, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, electric segment operating earnings were about $39 million more than a year ago, driven primarily by lower O&M expenses offset somewhat by lower industrial usage.","Now turning to Slide 8, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level, total debt level as of December 31st, was about $9.1 billion, of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 19 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility in our accounts receivable securitizations. Our credits rating from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we're committed to maintaining our current investment grade rating.","I'd now like to turn to Slide 9, which covers our financing plan for our long-term growth investments. I would note that our current financing plan can change based upon the timing of cash proceeds of insurance recoveries expected in 2019 and 2020. Our current plan continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from at the market or ATM equity issuance program and $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs, plus incremental long-term debt.","As you know, we filed an ATM program with the SEC on November 1st. This is consistent with our approach to provide balanced predictable financing for our infrastructure investments. The current ATM program allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020. Execution of our financing plan is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to the 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond. I would note that adjusting for the Greater Lawrence event we would have exceeded our 13% FFO to debt metric target in 2018.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe who will discuss a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.","Joe Hamrock","Thank you, Donald. Now, let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter of 2018 and the early 2019 from our gas operations on Slide 10. In Ohio, we received regulatory approval of our new annual capital expenditure program rider, which took effect with the December billing cycle. The approved $75 million rider allows us to begin recovering capital investments and other deferred expenses made between 2011 and 2017 that are not recovered under our infrastructure modernization tracker. Rates will be adjusted annually. The approved settlement benefits customers through reduced rates and bill credits related to federal tax reform.","In Pennsylvania, we received regulatory approval of our base rate case settlement, and new rates took effect in December. The settlement supports continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipeline, provides customers with the benefits of tax reform and is expected to increase annual revenues by $26 million. In Indiana, on March 1st, we'll implement the second of three steps in new gas distribution rates authorized by the IURC in our gas base rate case. The first step took effect on October 1st, following IURC approval of the settlement, which supports continued investments in system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability.","When new rates are fully implemented in January 2020, annual revenues are expected to increase by approximately $107 million, reflecting the benefits of federal tax reform. Also in Indiana, we continue to execute on our long-term gas modernization program with investments planned through 2020. We received regulatory approval of our latest tracker update request in December. And consistent with our long-term capital plan, on December 31st, we filed with the IURC, a FIMSA compliance plan covering approximately $230 million of capital expected to be invested between 2019 and 2023. We expect an order in the second half of 2019.","In Maryland, we received regulatory approval of the settlement in our base rate case. The new rates took effect in November. The settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $3.8 million, including $1.6 million of current infrastructure tracker revenue and supports continued replacement of gas pipelines and pipeline safety upgrades. In Virginia, new rates went into effect subject to refund with the February billing cycle in our base rate case, which remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Filed in August 2018, our request seeks to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from federal tax reform. If approved is filed, the request is expected to increase annual revenues by $22.2 million, including $8 million in revenues currently collected through our infrastructure tracker. We expect the commission order in the second half of 2019.","Now, let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 11. On February 1st, we made filings with the IURC seeking approval to develop three wind farms in Indiana in partnership with experienced renewable energy developers. The three projects, Jordan Creek, Roaming Bison and Rosewater, have nameplate capacity totaling 800 megawatts and are expected to be in operation by late 2020. These filings are consistent with our 2018 Integrated Resource Plan, submitted to the IURC in October. The IRP calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next five years, and all coal generation to be retired by 2028. The replacement capacity portfolio is still being fully defined and options point toward lower-cost renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and battery storage technology. We expect to announce additional renewable projects and issue a second request for proposals later this year.","Our goal is to transition to the most economical cleanest electric supply mix available, while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for technology and market changes. Our electric base rate case remains pending before the IURC. Filed in October 2018, the request seeks changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plants called for in the IRP, as well as changes in tariffs to provide service flexibility for industrial customers. It also reflects the impact of federal tax reform. If approved is filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $21 million. An IURC order is anticipated in the third quarter of 2019 with rates effective in September 2019.","Our approximately $193 million coal combustion residuals capital projects are progressing. Two of the units with the largest CCR projects are in service with the last unit scheduled to be in service in the first quarter of 2019. These projects include environmental upgrades at are generating facilities to meet current EPA standards. The IURC, in December 2017, approved this settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs. We continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization programs, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution systems designed to further improve system safety and reliability. The IURC approved program represents approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. We received regulatory approval in November of a settlement in our July 2018 tracker update request, which included a base rate refund to customers related to federal tax reform. We filed our latest tracker update request in January, covering approximately $59 million in incremental capital investments made from June 2018 through November 2018.","Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways about NiSource. We remain steadfast and our commitments to our customers in the impacted communities in the Merrimack Valley. We have a dedicated team and resources in place to complete the next phase of restoration, and we have a more complete picture of the total restoration costs. Safety remains the foundation for all that we do for our customers and the communities we serve. We're engaged in extensive efforts to enhance the safety and reliability of our gas distribution systems across our entire seven-state footprint. We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.27 to $1.33 per share and to make $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments in 2019.","Our long-term growth plan is intact and resilient. While we face some near-term headwinds in 2019, we expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually from 2019 through 2022, a two-year extension of our previous long-term forecast, and we expect to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. We remain focused on executing our core investment driven business plan across all seven states.","Thank you all for participating today, and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Muriel?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein","My first question just has to do with the capital expenditures Slide number 14 showing that you have additional spending out in the 2020 to 2022 range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. So the capital spending, is that reflective of where you think the IRPs are going to land and how the spending will turn out as a result for that process?","Donald Brown","So if look at the capital and the growth up to $2 billion annually is really around two things. Part of it is in the electric business where we need to invest in transmission as we transition from the coal plants to the renewable plants in 2023 when those projects go online. I think the other large part is around some infrastructure investments to increase our gas line capacity in Ohio, so it's really transmission lines on Columbia Gas of Ohio over a couple of years, because we've had customer growth and we need to increase the capacity there. And then the third item is around some infrastructure or IT systems that we plan to modernize, really our core operating systems, our billing, our work management and asset management systems. So that's really the three big drivers of the growth and annual CapEx over that time period.","Joe Hamrock","So what I would add though is if you think about the actual generation investments in wind and in solar that we're expecting that really is 2023 timing. What we're doing now that we've executed on three agreements on renewables, two of those are PPAs, the third is a joint venture that we would make an investment in. Because of our NOL, current status of our NOLs, we can't take advantage of the wind tax credit and so we have entered into tax equity type structures. And that would allow us, our customers to enjoy the tax benefits from an equity investor. And then our investment would come later in 2023, which is after our guidance. So as we get more projects signed up for the ultimate investments in 2023, we'll be able to provide guidance on what the total investments would be then.","Michael Weinstein","Maybe you can just comment about how the higher spending levels after 2020 will affect both equity issuances, expected equity. Can you maintain this through the ATM? Can you continue to fund through the ATM and internal programs? And then also how it might affect where you will land in the 5% to 7% growth range after 2020?","Donald Brown","So the financing plan we've got here through 2022 to $200 million and $300 million annually, it includes all those assumptions around this financing, as well as the higher CapEx included in our plan. The ATM program as you know $500 million program. And so if you think about it $200 million to $300 million a year that really would afford us for a couple of years of our equity needs to establish another\u2026","Michael Weinstein","But how about the earnings growth rate 5% to 7%, is that -- would it be reasonable to conclude that you might be in the upper end of that, because of the higher spending rates?","Donald Brown","I think, it's too early. We certainly are -- we've talked about earnings guidance being and annual current earnings guidance, and so the 5% to 7% is off of 2019. And when we get the 2020, we will be able to guide there. But there is certainly potential within that range. If you think about what drives our earnings, its regulatory outcomes and infrastructure programs. And so I can't guide beyond where we are.","Michael Weinstein ","And just one last question and I'll let you go to other people. In Massachusetts, what's the timing you think on how you're making a decision on when to file a new rate case there, or any other strategic considerations being considered at this time at the board?","Joe Hamrock","Our ultimate regulatory plan for CMA will be developed after we ensure full restoration and recovery in Merrimack Valley. So I'd expect to hear more on that later this year, possibly even in the next year. And it is important to note that the interplay between resolution of claims and restoration activity is going to be important to resolve before we fully contemplate regulatory activity related to our work in CMA.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Ritchie here for Julien. I just had a quick question, more of a housekeeping question. But are you going to still be hosting the Analyst Day sometime this year?","Joe Hamrock","We're likely not going to do the mid-year Analyst Day that we had previously talked about. We'll to work our way through the 2019 activities, and look for an update on that later this year.","Donald Brown","And that was one of the reasons that we wanted to provide longer term guidance here on this call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Paul Ridzon","I know you guys always tend to do pretty conservative, and seem like some of the things that caused this dip below your prior trajectory are temporary. Is there a chance you could get back-up to that EPS trajectory before March?","Joe Hamrock","You're right that some of what we're working through is temporary in nature, a lot of it related to financing the claims, the investments in our safety initiatives this year. We'll stick to the 5% to 7% guidance off of 2019 that we've talked about here today and not try to get into longer-range projections of how that might play out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Subbing in for Insoo here. One or two questions I want to make sure I understand a few things. First of all, the 5% to 7% and this maybe a little piggy tacky, but you mentioned in as earnings growth rate. Historically, you would always say earnings per share or EPS growth rate. I assume you're referring to EPS growth when you use that data. Or is there going to be a difference between the net income growth rate and the earnings per share growth rate?","Donald Brown","Thank you for clarifying that. That is 5% to 7% earnings and dividends, so it's EPS and dividends growth rate.","Unidentified Analyst ","The other thing is just curious related to Greater Lawrence. Third-party claims obviously make-up the largest percentage of the $1.1 billion or so of costs. Just how are you guys thinking about when you will have certainty around that? If I remember correctly, and customers have an extended period of time before they hit a deadline when they have to file claims. Can you remind us of what is that timeline and when will that timeline and therefore, you will have greater certainty about the total claim level?","Donald Brown","So customer have a couple of years, and I don\u2019t know exactly what their time period is to file claims from the event. We've certainly have restored nearly all of our customers to have gas service. So the bulk of our expenses are behind us. We've got some restoration to do this summer once the winter end around streets and savings. There is also some appliances that we need to replace that we only fix some of the customers' appliances in the fall and winter time period, and promise them we would come back and replace those appliances in the summer. So as I look at what's left, it really is a much smaller part of our total expected $1.1 billion in expenses.","Unidentified Analyst","Meaning you don\u2019t think that one point here over $1 billion expense number changes a lot relative to what's already been filed by customers?","Donald Brown","No, I don\u2019t expect that number to change significantly.","Unidentified Analyst ","And then just last item, of all those senses that you outlined on Page 12, how much of those have you actually paid out in cash versus our future cash payments you might make down the road?","Donald Brown","So we've paid out most of it. I want to say that we are probably close to $1 billion -- 75% of the expenses have been paid out already.","Unidentified Analyst","So that $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion outlined on Page 12, you've paid our 75% of that number since the August and September event?","Donald Brown","That's correct. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza","Just need to -- just on Michael's question addification. The insurance, so if you look at amounts that you can under recover versus your policies and that's how that impacts potential incremental equity needs and what you guys are assuming and your growth plan, you guys have around $800 million in liability insurance, $300 on for property. Your total expenses at roughly 1.1, part of those expenses may not be applicable to the property insurance. So there is a potential that you could under recover a little bit versus what you guys have access to. And then there are the arguments that the insurance companies can make from a defense standpoint. So I guess what are the pushes and takes around incremental equity if you see any a few under recover? And then as you guys are thinking about your growth rate. What are you embedding as far as recoveries and amounts that are not able to be recovered?","Donald Brown","So based upon our conversations with our insurance providers, and we're working through it. And as you can expect, we've got a tower of insurance providers in the $800 million and one insurance provider in the $300 million property. We've got to work through each one of them to submit and substantiate claims, and that's going to be a lengthy process. So it\u2019s hard for me to at this point given exact estimate of what we will recover through that process. However, we did hire an outside firm who specializes in claims. And they were actually on-site in early September to help make sure we have the right information in the right format to really expedite this process.","So as I think about that from a financing standpoint and our expectations that's embedded in our financing plan, which includes the $200 million to $300 million of equity a year. The only caveat to that is part of that timing of recovery of the insurance proceeds could impact the timing of when we need equity to ensure that we hit our target ratings or target metrics. But on average the $200 million to $300 million is what's our expectations are for equity needs.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then under any scenario at least through 2020, you don't see the need to have to issue any block deals?","Donald Brown","No, there is no block deals plan at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon","So can you repeat what you said the updated estimates are for -- you've laid out very clearly what the costs -- estimated costs are here on Page 12 directly related Great Lawrence, but you also commented on what you're doing across the entire gas system to make sure that you're operating safely and reliably. So there were operating cost increases across the system as well as capital costs increases across the system. Can you just go through again what those incremental costs are please?","Joe Hamrock","Yes, that\u2019s correct, Greg. In the 2019 guidance, not only do we reflect the financing costs related to the cash flows from the Greater Lawrence incident but incremental spending to accelerate our safety management systems implementation, that's an effort that have started. Over a year ago, we have accelerated that substantially, brought in outside experts. So you see a few cents inside that guidance that\u2019s related to the one-time startup costs to accelerate that. And those won't stick for the long-term, but they really do have an impact in 2019 as it relates to the acceleration. We do expect as we've noted before, flat O&M across the board. But if you look below at the segment level, you will likely see some incremental O&M on the gas segment related to the safety initiatives. Of course, our electric business is repositioning, so that that O&M and profile will change as well. And then at corporate, we continue to look for opportunities to consolidate platforms. And Donald mentioned some incremental IT spending in the out years of the plan here related to modernization of those systems as well. So number of different moving pieces inside all that but that's the biggest one in 2019.","Donald Brown","So really it's around pension expense being higher because of the lower returns in 2019.","Greg Gordon","So O&M is or isn\u2019t -- I'm a little confused. I think it's absolutely the right thing to do to make sure you get your safety and reliability up to where you needed to be. And spending more on that in the short run is obviously appropriate if you need to do that. But that means higher O&M in the short-run but flat O&M in the long run. Or are you moving things around so that it's flat, because you just told me that there's a few pennies in the new guidance for that, which would be mean O&M is up not flat?","Joe Hamrock","We were expecting and guiding flat O&M across our planning horizons. And so there is some offsets within our corporate and electric business that will have lower O&M that will offset some of the investments we're making on the gas side.","Greg Gordon","So I know that you've gives us the 5% to 7% guidance for growth on earnings and the dividend, and that's based off of the '19 guidance range. But '19 guidance is basically flat with where '18 guidance was a year-ago. And you were giving a 5% earnings growth rate off of that '18 guidance then. So we basically lost a year of earnings growth as it relates to the impact of the Greater Lawrence event. Unless what you're telling us and this is why I'm asking this is that the things depressing '19 are temporary. So just want to be clear is it performer or is it the latter?","Donald Brown","So earnings growth, the 5% to 7%, is off of the new 2019 guidance of $1.27 to $1.33. There are costs around financing. The insurance receivable recovery process that are impacting 2019 and will flow into 2020, similarly as Joe said on our safety investments and SMS, those are costs that we are incurring in 2019. And we'll be to some extent going forward costs and safety and reliability in the gas business","ability in the gas business going forward. And so we hopefully helped clear it up. I agree that we have lost the year, because of the incremental costs and investments that we are making, but long-term we get back to our 5% to 7% annual growth.","Greg Gordon","And also just last question on that front. The updated guidance reflects some estimates for convertible subordinated debt or preferred equity, because you have TBD there on Page 9, as it relates to financing these costs. So Shahriar asked you about common equity, which you said is absolutely not in the plan, and I appreciate that. But some of the incremental convertible subordinated debt or preferred equity is in the plan, and that will be sized based on your cash flow needs as you work through these the payments and recovery of insurance claims. Is that a fairway to summarize it?","Joe Hamrock","So yes, certainly we'll continue to evaluate the use of preferred equity or junior subordinated debt. We have not in the past done convertibles and that's not something that we are currently looking at to include in our capital plan or our financing plan?","Greg Gordon","I misread the slide, this is non-convertible. I apologize. Thank you guys, have a great morning.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman","If I could ask a question on your reconciliation of adjusted operating income to GAAP. In the fourth quarter, you had $3.9 million due to the Greater Lawrence incident. Looks like it's just non-billed sales for customers. And I assume that that's not covered by any business interruption, insurance, or anything like that. And then related to that is the $10.4 million in the fourth quarter for charitable contributions. Will that continue in the 2019 expenses like that that are going to be considered special incident or special expenses related to Greater Lawrence incident?","Joe Hamrock","So, let's with the charitable contributions. We'll continue to evaluate our terrible investments that we make in communities right now. We don't have anything significantly planned to discuss and breakout. And so that will continue as we progress with our efforts in the Merrimack Valley. Your other question was around insurance on -- business interruption insurance. So no, there is no business interruption insurance for loss revenues for the customers that we weren't charging during the event.","Charles Fishman","So even if those numbers continue, the numbers we saw in the fourth quarter are likely to be a peek and they'll head lower?","Joe Hamrock","No, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see that going forward.","Charles Fishman","And then another second question, capital expenditures I'm looking at Slide 14, those bars or the segments in those bars moved upward. In other words you're getting faster recovery. I'm assuming that's the impact of the Ohio legislation. Is that correct?","Joe Hamrock","Yes, we were always about 75% in that 70% to 80% range being recovered within 12 months. The 2018 chart includes the investments in the Merrimack Valley and so that one is a little bit higher going through a rate case the 31% there. Going forward we're back in that range around 75% and that is helped by the Ohio CEP program.","Charles Fishman","Well, in 2022 on Slide 14, you're now about 19% of your investment is collected within three months, your long-term used to be about 16%. That's driven by Ohio correct?","Joe Hamrock","Not that, it's really growth. If you think about that green bar is customer growth. And so we do continue to see progress on our customer growth efforts and seeing that those investments grow overtime to get us to our 1% net annual net customer growth.","Charles Fishman","So it's more shifting of what the investment, the CapEx is?","Joe Hamrock","That's right.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock, CEO for any further remarks.","Joe Hamrock","Thanks Muriel and thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect.

Skaggs - Chief Executive Officer, President, Director and Interim Chief Executive Officer for Gas Distribution Segment","Analysts","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the quarter 1 2013 NiSource Earnings Conference Call. My name is Patrick, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Glen Kettering, Senior Vice President of corporate affairs. Please proceed, sir.","Glen L. Kettering","Thank you, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of NiSource, I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Bob Skaggs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Hulen, Managing Director of Investor Relations. The focus of today's call is to review our financial performance for the first quarter of 2013 and to provide a business update. We'll then open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we will refer to the supplemental slides available on nisource.com.","I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning those risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Skaggs.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks, Glen, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. For today's agenda, we'll touch on key highlights from another solid quarter. We'll discuss our financial results and our operational highlights from each of our business units and then we'll open the call to your questions. Let's start on slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning. As we noted in this morning's press release, in just a few months, the NiSource team has made significant progress on a number of fronts: financial, regulatory, legislative and infrastructure investment. From a financial perspective, NiSource's first quarter results were well in line with our expectations and our full year earnings guidance of $1.50 to $1.60 per share non-GAAP. We'll provide a bit more context on our financial results in just a few moments.","One of our most significant recent achievements is new Indiana legislation that improved the efficiency of the regulatory process and provides a framework for modernizing Indiana's gas and electric infrastructure. This landmark legislation dovetails nicely with NIPSCO's long-term strategy to modernize its core utility system.","Another key development during the quarter was the filing of Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's unanimous rate case settlement with the Pennsylvania Commission. Among other things, that settlement reflects a $55 million revenue increase and provides more enhanced rate design.","And as we noted during our year-end call in February, our team is actively executing on the FERC-approved Columbia Gas Transmission modernization program. That program includes a steady stream of infrastructure investments that'll enhance the integrity, reliability and flexibility of the Columbia Gas Transmission system.","Looking across NiSource, I'd note that we're fully on track with our overall capital investment program which, you'll recall, is targeted to reach approximately $1.8 billion in 2013. And we continue to support those investments with a balanced and disciplined corporate financing strategy, most recent example being the issuance earlier this month of $750 million in 30-year notes at a very attractive rate. And finally, I'd point out that each of the 3 major credit rating agencies recently reaffirmed NiSource's stable investment grade credit ratings.","So in a nutshell, continued steady, disciplined execution of our strategy during the first quarter, keeping us squarely in line with our performance expectations for 2013 and beyond.","With those highlights, let's take a closer look at our first quarter, starting with our financial results on Slide 4. As you can see, NiSource delivered net operating earnings non-GAAP of about $215 million or $0.69 per share during the first quarter. That compares with about $214 million or $0.76 per share for the same period last year. Our operating earnings for the quarter came in at about $428 million.","As I mentioned, these results are in line with our expectations and the guidance range we announced earlier this year. It's important to note that are first quarter results fully reflect our 2012 $340 million forward equity issuance, which added approximately 24 million common shares when compared to the same period last year. That impacted the quarter by about $0.07. I'd also note that over the balance of the year, NiSource's earnings will be favorably impacted by a number of regulatory outcomes and growth projects, which are outlined on the supplemental slides.","On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations for the quarter was about $215 million or $0.69 per share compared to about $193 million or $0.68 per share in the first quarter of last year. Schedules 1 and 2 to our earnings release shows the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items.","Turning to our individual business unit results, let's start at our Columbia Pipeline business, or CPG, that's summarized on Slide 5. From an earnings standpoint, CPG generated operating earnings of about $133 million in the first quarter compared to about $139 million during the same time last year. As I mentioned, the most significant highlight is the FERC's approval of our landmark system modernization agreement between Columbia Gas Transmission and its customers. With a clear path forward and a transparent recovery mechanism, the team is already in full execution mode. This long-term program ultimately is expected to involve $4 billion to $5 billion in investment to ensure the ongoing safety, reliability and flexibility of our system.","Our pipeline and midstream development teams also are continuing to develop and execute on infrastructure investment opportunities in existing and new markets, including projects to serve the Utica and Marcellus Shale regions. For example, our approximately $160 million Big Pine Gathering System is now in service, capable of transporting more than 400 million cubic feet per day of Marcellus shale production. That project is underpinned by a long-term gathering agreement with XTO Energy. We also recently signed a separate gathering agreement on the Big Pine System with PennEnergy. They expect to begin flowing gas by the end of the year or early in 2014.","As I mentioned on our last call, our joint Utica Shale venture with Hilcorp, Pennant Midstream, LLC, continues to make good progress. The Pennant pipeline and processing facilities are on schedule to be completed and in service by the end of 2013. As a reminder, NiSource is responsible for $150 million of the total investment in Pennant's first phase.","From a production standpoint, our resource development arrangement with Hilcorp is progressing as well. Hilcorp remains one of the most active companies in the Utica in Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania, and they're currently drilling a seventh test delineation well. Preliminary results are encouraging and early indications of liquids content are consistent with active wells in the area. And perhaps even more notably, Hilcorp is now actively drilling 3 production wells in the Brinker area. They're in various stages of completion.","Our commercial team also is moving ahead on a new project to support a large Virginia industrial customer's conversion from a coal-fired boiler to a gas-fired boiler. That project will extend our Columbia Gas Transmission system about 13 miles to an interconnect with Columbia Gas of Virginia, who will also extend its system to serve that customer. The total investment for NiSource is about $40 million, with an in-service date of October 2014.","At Millennium Pipeline, the partnership is executing on 2 concurrent compressor projects that will significantly increase capacity on the pipeline. The first project, the so-called Minisink Compressor, will increase Millennium's capacity at its interconnections with Algonquin Gas Transmission to -- I'm sorry, 675,000 dekatherms. That project is targeted for completion in May. The second project, the Hancock Compressor, will increase capacity to 800,000 dekatherms in Delaware County, New York, and is expected to be placed into service by the end of this year.","And finally, as we discussed in prior calls, our East Side and West Side Expansion projects are on budget and on schedule. These projects represent a combined investment of more than $400 million, and together, will add approximately 800,000 dekatherms per day of new transportation capacity on our systems. An initial level of service has already begun on the West Side Expansion.","As you can see, our pipeline team is moving forward on a number of fronts. Leveraging our assets in the shale basins while maintaining a sharp focus on core growth and modernization projects. Before moving to NIPSCO, I wanted to remind everyone the detailed information about infrastructure projects across NiSource are available in the appendix of our supplemental slides.","Let's now shift to Indiana and our electric business as summarized on Slide 6. During the quarter, NIPSCO delivered strong operational and financial performance while advancing several significant customer legislative and regulatory programs. From an earnings standpoint, operating earnings came in at about $65 million in the first quarter compared to about $49 million last year during the same period.","The most recent highlight, as I mentioned previously, was legislation that supports NIPSCO's long-term utility modernization plans. The legislation reinforces the need for a sustainable and reliable energy infrastructure, the level of that investment required to meet this need. Notably, the legislation also will improve the efficiency of the regulatory process in a number of important respects.","NIPSCO also is on track with significant environmental investments at its electric generation facilities, including our more than $500 million scrubber project at our Schahfer Generating Station. Those new units will be placed into service in the fourth quarter of this year and in 2014. Construction work has also begun at our Michigan City Generating Station where NIPSCO is installing another $250 million FGD unit.","On the transmission front, NIPSCO is moving forward with an investment of up to $500 million for 2 fully approved electric transmission projects in Northern Indiana. These projects will strengthen the Midwest electric infrastructure while supporting economic development and providing new jobs. Planning and outreach activities are the key focus for these projects in 2013, with in-service currently targeted to the latter part of this decade.","And on the customer front, NIPSCO has begun installing nearly 1 million gas and electric automated meter reading devices across its service territory. At a total investment of about $90 million over 3 years, these devices will aid in the efficiency and accuracy of our meter reading.","And finally, I'd note that NIPSCO recently received regulatory approval for the introduction of a Green Power Rate pilot program. This complements a variety of renewable energy and customer programs in Indiana and allows customers to designate a portion or all of their power to be generated by renewable energy sources. Truly a milestone quarter that will create sustainable long-term benefits across all of NIPSCO's service territory.","Let's turn now to our Gas Distribution Operations, or NGD, discussed on Slide 7. Our NGD team continues to deliver strong results by aligning it's $10 billion infrastructure replacement and enhancement program with a variety of complementary customer and regulatory initiatives. From an earnings standpoint, NGD operating earnings for the quarter came in at about $233 million compared to about $245 million for the same period in 2012. These results remain in line with our expectations. Over the balance of the year, we'll have additional earnings growth including new rate to Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and increased IRP tracker rates at Columbia Gas of Ohio.","As I noted, a key highlight of the quarter is the unanimous settlement in mid-March of our Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania rate case, the settlement awaiting final PUC decision, will increase annual revenues by $55 million through a simplified residential rate design that includes a weather normalization adjustment and full recovery of safety-related expenditures. Notably, we're the first utility in the state to establish rates based on a fully forecasted test year. Rates are anticipated to be placed into service this July.","Also on the regulatory front, the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Maryland filed new rate cases. In Massachusetts, the case is designed to support the company's expanded infrastructure efforts with timely recovery. The case seeks an increase in annual revenues of $30 million. In Maryland, the case seeks an annual revenue increase of about $5 million. We expect the decision in Massachusetts during the first quarter of 2014 and in Maryland during the third quarter of this year.","On the legislative front, a new law effective January 2013 now allows Columbia Gas of Virginia and other Virginia-based natural gas utilities to defer certain costs associated with safety compliance programs for recovery in future rate cases. Meanwhile, Maryland passed legislation permitting gas utilities to recover pipeline modernization costs on a timely basis. That new legislation is awaiting the Governor's signature and is expected to take effect June 1.","Consistent with our plan, our Gas Distribution team is continuing to execute on its well-established strategy of investing in safety and reliability while providing innovative programs to customers and solid financial performance for shareholders.","Last, but certainly not least, on the financing and liquidity front. At the end of the first quarter, NiSource maintained approximately $900 million in net available liquidity. Beyond the $750 million debt issued earlier this month, NiSource took additional steps to improve its liquidity position. This includes increasing our 3-year bank term loan by $75 million to a total of $325 million and extending its maturity date to April 15, 2016. In addition, we increased our commercial paper program from a limit of $500 million to $1.5 billion, this program is supported by our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.","Finally, before opening the call to your questions, I want to once again reaffirm our full year earnings guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60 per share non-GAAP. I also want to reiterate our unwavering financial commitments, which are to maintain investment-grade credit ratings as recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies, sustainable earnings growth of 5% to 7% annually, a strong growing dividend of 3% to 5% annually, robust liquidity, again, as evidenced by our disciplined financial strategy, including our recent debt issuance and other enhancements.","As always, we'll communicate with you and all our stakeholders about these and all other matters of importance in a transparent and timely manner through our analyst calls and news releases posted on nisource.com. Thanks for your participation today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We deeply appreciate it. Now, Patrick, we can open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Bob, does that new Indiana legislation -- does that cover gas distribution, too?","Robert C. Skaggs","It covers gas distribution for the enhancements in the process and also for extensions of gas facilities into underserved areas.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then like if I look at -- there was a slide, which one is it? I'm sorry. It showed like future transmission projects, here it is, Slide 14 for NIPSCO. I assume some of that, if not all of it, is under FERC, but would that kind of a thing be covered too under the new legislation?","Robert C. Skaggs","No. The legislation is primarily distribution-oriented and what I would call more routine transmission modernization as opposed to large-scale expansions or a greenfield construction of transmission. Those sorts of major projects, let's say, are the jurisdiction of MISO and, ultimately, FERC approval.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So then like -- one other, following on with that. So like the AMR meters, those would be that tight even though that might be too early for this?","Robert C. Skaggs","Too early for that. And that's going ultimately be recovered via rate case process or proceeding.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","But if you installed more of those AMR meters, that would be covered under the new legislation, correct?","Robert C. Skaggs","Frankly, Charles, great question. I don't know about that issue, specifically. What I would say, I think as a good baseline is, we and the other utilities are going to have to file a 7-year program of activity. Now the Commission's going to review that program, stakeholders are going to review that program and, ultimately, have a sign-off on the composition of that program. So I think that's going to be the venue, if you will, or vehicle, that's going to be more determinative of what sort of investment and activity is in or is out.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Robert C. Skaggs","All right, Patrick, we know it's a busy day out there in the market. We certainly, again, appreciate everybody's interest. And I'm certain we're going to field follow-up questions later.

We remain confident in our long-term forecast of 5% to 7% annual growth of our non-GAAP earnings per share and dividend from 2019 through 2022 and expect to make capital investments of $1.6 billion to $2 billion annually from 2020 through 2022.","Gas system safety enhancements are advancing across our seven-state footprint, including accelerated implementation of a Safety Management System or SMS. Our SMS is aligned with the framework developed for pipeline operators by the American Petroleum Institute. SMS is a comprehensive approach to managing safety, emphasizing continual assessment and improvement, and identifying and mitigating potential operational risks proactively.","As part of our SMS work, enhancing risk management processes have been introduced at each of our operating companies. We've added additional safety expertise to our Quality Review Board, the independent entity overseeing our SMS implementation.","Cynthia Quarterman, former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration joined our QRB in June. The now six-member board chaired by former Transportation Secretary, Ray LaHood, includes experts with diverse backgrounds spanning the aviation, energy, and nuclear industries.","In addition, Deborah Hersman, former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board was appointed to the NiSource Board of Directors in June. Having these widely respected safety experts on our team is of great value as we focus on continuously improving our safety practices.","We are also making significant progress on installing over pressurization protection, automatic shut-off devices on our low-pressure systems. Teams have installed more than 800 of these devices across our footprint, including all necessary work in Virginia. These devices operate like circuit breakers. They are designed so that when they sense operating pressure that is too high or too low, they immediately shutdown gas to the system, regardless of the cause. This work remains a top priority.","Our gas team continues to execute on regulatory initiatives with the approval of the settlement in our Virginia base rate case and filing of a new base rate case in Maryland. In Indiana, the hearing began last week in our electric base rate case and is expected to continue until August 7.","We filed a partial settlement in April with key stack holders which addresses our revenue requirement, federal tax reform and depreciation schedules related to the early retirement of our coal plants. We expect an order in the fourth quarter. Also in Indiana, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission last month approved Power Purchase Agreements in two of our wind project applications.","We remained focused on the restoration and customer support in the Merrimack Valley. We are nearly done replacing heating equipment for approximately 875 customers, whose furnaces or boilers were repaired in the weeks following the September 2018 event, and we expect to be 100% complete by September 15.","In May, we reached a settlement with the three impacted municipalities in which we agreed to pay $80 million to cover municipal property restoration, including road repair and to resolve all other municipal claims. And as announced on Monday, we reached an agreement in principle to settle all class action lawsuits resulting from the Greater Lawrence event. With that agreement, which is subject to court approval, we've now resolved four major civil claims against the company.","Does that reflect on this? I'd like to add that we will always be mindful of the impact this tragic event has had on our customers and everyone in these communities.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?","Donald Brown","Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our second quarter results on Slide 4, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.05 per share compared with about $26 million or $0.07 per share for the same period in 2018. The biggest driver of our non-GAAP financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, supported by constructive regulatory outcomes and established infrastructure trackers.","Before turning to our business segment financial results, I'd like to address the Greater Lawrence incident expenses. Our total estimates which is detailed on Slide 10, is somewhat higher due to the class action settlement and other expenses as described in our 10-Q for the second quarter. Going forward with four major civil claims related to the event now resolved and the restoration work near completely, we don't expect any significant future adjustments to the estimate.","As a reminder, this estimate excludes any amounts we may incur for potential fines and penalties. Also as we've previously stated, we expect to recover a substantial portion of our Greater Lawrence incident costs through the $800 million of cash and insurance coverage and $300 million of property insurance in place at the time of the event.","We started submitting claims in December, 2018 and have recorded casualty insurance recoveries of $670 million through June 30 and have collected $535 million in cast to-date. We have also filed our claim with our property insurer and discussions around this claim and recovery have begun. As insurance recovery process moves forward, we plan to continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress.","Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for business segments. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment had operating earnings of about $47 million for the quarter compared with about $36 million for the same period in 2018. The increase was driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement program execution.","Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $86 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $77 million for the comparable period in 2018. The increase was driven primarily by infrastructure replacement program execution.","Looking at our consolidate year-to-date O&M expenses are non-tracked O&M is essentially flat compared to our 2017 baseline. But slightly higher than 2018 due to increased safety related spending in our Gas segment.","Looking forward, we expect a slight increase in expenses related to safety enhancement programs we're implementing across the Company. We believe the safety enhancements are prudent benefit of our customers and the communities we served.","Our financial results coupled with our solid execution on the regulatory front through the first half of the year strengthens our confidence in reaffirming both our 2019 non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance of a $27 to $33 as well as our long-term earnings and dividend growth forecast. We also expect to maintain our current financing plan.","Now turning the Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our total debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion \u2013 about $6.9 billion was long-term debt. The weighted-average of maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years in the weighted-average interest rate was approximately 4.6%.","At the end of the first quarter, we maintain net available liquidity of about $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under a credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. Our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade, and we're committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings.","I'd now like to turn to Slide 6, which covers our financing plan for our long-term growth investments. Our current plan continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our at-the-market or ATM equity issuance program and $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs, plus incremental long-term debt.","Our ATM is consistent with our approach to provide balanced, predictable financing for our infrastructure investments. In execution of our financing plan is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to the 14% to 15% range over the long-term.","Before I turn the call back to Joe for a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights, I wanted to note that we plan to provide 2020 non-GAAP earnings and capital investment guidance on our third quarter call, consistent with our practice in recent years. Joe?","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you, Donald. Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter and early third quarter of 2019 from our Gas Operations on Slide 7. In Virginia, we received regulatory approval in June of the settlement agreement in our base rate case.","The approved settlement supports ongoing infrastructure investment programs, addresses the impacts of federal tax reform and increases annual revenues by $9.5 million, including $8.2 million in revenues currently collected through our infrastructure tracker. Final approved rates went into effect in July 2019.","In Maryland, we filed a base rate case request in May with the Maryland Public Service Commission to support continued replacement of aging pipelines and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $3.7 million, including $1.2 million of current infrastructure tracker revenue. A commission order is expected by the end of 2019, with rates in effect in January 2020.","In Ohio, our first annual application for adjustment to our Capital Expenditure Program rider remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. The CEP rider, which was first approved by the PUCO in 2018, allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through our infrastructure modernization tracker. The application seeks to begin recovery of approximately $122 million in capital invested in 2018. A PUCO order is expected in August 2019 with rates affected in September 2019.","In Indiana, we filed our latest tracker update request in June and our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program, covering $12.4 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2018 and April 2019. An Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 with rates effective November 2019.","Also in Indiana, our PHMSA compliance plan, covering approximately $230 million of capital expected to be invested between 2019 and 2023, remains pending before the IURC. We expect an order in the second half of 2019.","Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 8. In June, the IURC approved Power Purchase Agreement applications for two of the three wind projects; Jordan Creek and Roaming Bison that we announced in February. The application for the joint venture and ownership agreement for the third project Rosewater remains pending before the IURC, with an order expected in the third quarter of 2019.","The three projects have nameplate capacity totaling 800 megawatts. Jordan Creek and Rosewater are expected to be in operation by late 2020, and Roaming Bison by 2021. The wind project filings are consistent with 2018 Integrated Resource Plan, which calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation in the next five years, and all coal generation to be retired by 2028.","We expect to issue a second Request for Proposals in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our goal is to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for technology and market changes. The hearing is underway in our electric base rate case, which remains pending before the IURC.","As we mentioned on our first quarter call, we filed partial settlement agreement in April, which addresses the revenue requirement, federal tax reform and depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plans called for in our 2018 integrated resource plan. If approved as filed, the partial settlement is earnings neutral and allows for return on equity of 9.9%.","I would add that in May, we reached a settlement with the Industrial Group, which resolves many issues related to implementing a new service structure for industrial customers. The hearing is addressing cost allocation and rate design, and IURC order is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2019. We continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.","The IURC approved TDSIC program represents approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. In June, the IURC approved or latest tracker update request covering approximately $59 million an incremental capital investments made from June 2018 through November 2018. Before revisiting our key takeaways for the quarter, I'll share a couple of quick updates.","Our NIPSCO subsidiary was named one of the most improved brands nationally in the latest J.D. Power Residential Natural Gas Customer Satisfaction Survey and we had the highest satisfaction among Indiana energy companies. This strong performance is evidence that our team is focused on delivering for our customers is paying off. I mentioned earlier the progress we are making on our accelerated SMS implementation.","We were pleased to see the American Gas Association Board recommend in May that all AGA member companies adopted a Pipeline Safety Management System modeled after the API framework. As AGA noted, safety is at the core of what our industry does and adopting SMS is another way gas utilities go above and beyond to protect our employees, customers, and the communities we serve.","As we turn to the Q&A portion of the call, I'll share a few key takeaways. Our teams are executing well on our critical priorities across the business. As a result, we're confident in reaffirming our 2019 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range of a $1.27 to a $1.33 per share and our financing plan. Our long-term investment driven growth plan is intact and resilient. We continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually from 2019 through 2022, and we expect to maintain our current investment grade credit ratings.","Safety remains the foundation for all that we do for our customers and the communities we serve and we're advancing that commitment with our accelerated SMS implementation across our seven state footprints with strong independent oversight by our Quality Review Board.","Our electric generation strategy is advancing with our wind project PPA's approved and our electric base rate cases progressing with settlements in place addressing key issues and the hearing underway. We're making substantial progress in the Merrimack Valley restoration with heating system replacements, nearly complete and settlements reached in our largest civil cases.","Again, I'll note that all of this reinforces our ongoing commitment to residents and businesses impacted by the event. We remain mindful of the impact of this tragic event and we're dedicated to finishing the restoration.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions. Josh?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning.","Joseph Hamrock","Good morning, Julien.","Donald Brown","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, pleasure. So a couple quick items. First, maybe a little bit more housekeeping. How are you thinking about strategic avenues here with respect to Massachusetts? I know that there's a lot going forward here. Just if you can comment at all, I\u2019d be curious. And then I've got a couple of others.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks Julien. It was a matter of policy. We do not comment on M&A rumors or speculation. Our focus in Massachusetts is on delivering safe and reliable natural gas and high-quality service to our over 300,000 customers there. And continuing the restoration and rebuilding that we've talked about here this morning, and those efforts in the Merrimack Valley continue. And our focus remains on that level of service across our entire seven state footprint.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And then moving to a more substantive matters I suppose, when you think about Indiana, are you talking about an RFP coming up? How do you think about some of the challenges that we saw this spring in Indiana, maybe at the legislature, et cetera, we've got perhaps a little bit of a follow through on that front as well. Can you comment how you evaluate or think about some of the pressures there relative to sort of an economic pursuit of resources with respect to your RFP process? I'm just curious how you balance both of those, especially in the decarbonization trajectory you talk about?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. I mean there's obviously going to be a bit of a tail on the policy agenda there, especially with the taskforce setting up and we'd expect to see continued discourse around the transition of electric generation, not just in our portfolio, but in the state and in the region. As we all know, that's a pretty high profile discussion in many of the states across the Midwest.","So we're front and center in that. I think that the thing neutralizes that or makes it kind of more objective and transparent is the very approach that we've taken that being to issue RFPs at every step along the way. So that everyone can see what's available in the market and what the straightforward economics and the alternatives are.","And as we noted, we'll continue to use that approach with another round of RFPs this fall. So that that discussion can be informed by objective market data and we'll continue with that policy. And we don't know what we'll see in the next round. So we'll continue to keep an open mind as well as we step through this.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Quick housekeeping or last item here. With respect to \u2013 I think I heard a 3Q update on CapEx, is that when we'll get a little bit more detailed on what this new approach with respect to gas, risk assessments, playout more materially with respect to both cost and CapEx?","Joseph Hamrock","Absolutely. We're planning and expect to provide guidance both from an earning standpoint as well as a capital standpoint. And at that point, we'll be able to provide some perspectives on how SMS may have shaped our portfolio both from an O&M standpoint as well as a capital standpoint.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And inclusive of the RFP expectations or is that would be later on?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. I would say the RFP expectations will be later on in 2020.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate the time.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Joseph Hamrock","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","On the RFPs and the IRP at NIPSCO, I think you and I have talked to before about the use of tax equity, possibly being proposed to regulators for regulated projects. And just want to give you comment on that and whether that mitigates future financing needs in terms of equity needs and going forward?","Joseph Hamrock","So we have started the conversations with our regulators in Indiana. We have the one project that is a joint venture project. It's new to Indiana and its news across the country. In terms of that type of structure in a regulated business, we think we are progressing on that and expect to get an order in the third quarter around that joint venture investment.","From a financing standpoint, look at it up front. There certainly is the opportunity for an equity investor to take most of the investment upfront. How we are looking to structure these transactions though is that on the backend, in some future period, five years, 10 years, we would end up having ownership, most of that ownership of those projects.","So I'd say it's a short-term period where we wouldn't have to put in the amount of investment for the full project. But at some point, we would want to have the bulk of that investment within the utility.","Michael Weinstein","Right. That makes sense. With the risk of the investor purchasing the tax credits, so that that would in theory reduces the cost of the project?","Joseph Hamrock","That is correct, yep. And provide the tax savings to our customers.","Michael Weinstein","Correct. Right, and then on the NTSB investigation, do you have any indication about timing on that when it's supposed to come out and what are your expectations in terms of what it might say?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. As you might imagine, Michael, we can't speak for the NTSB and their process and their discourse. We've been working very closely with them literally from day one, and remain in that mode of working with aligned objective that to understand everything that led to the incident and how we can work to prevent those incidents in the future. They have said that they expected within a year or so of the incident to have a report, but again we don't have any specific details on that.","Michael Weinstein","Gotcha. And on insurance recovery and pace of recoveries, has that coming in a little faster than expected on exactly as you expected? How is that affecting the \u2013 I guess the drag on earnings as a result of having to finance the cost, while you await recovery?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. The insurance progress has progressed as you see we brought in $535 million of cash and both the receivable of $670 and so it's going really well, our insurance policy holders are working very constructively with us we've done. I think a very good job of providing them a lot of information to support the claims process. And so I think that has helped move the process along and obviously that has helped us from a financing standpoint and reduce the financing needs really short-term debt here this year.","So we still have more to go to get the $800 million and we do continue to expect to get a substantial portion of that $800 million between the end of this year and next year. Having said that \u2013 with the \u2013 more than half of those proceeds coming through this year, we do expect that we'll be in the market here in the third quarter to help finance the company long-term. So working on that plan, so it won't give out any details yet, but we expect that we'll be in for a long-term financing in the third quarter.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Gotcha. Thank you.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed with your question.","Christopher Turnure","Thank you. Don, maybe you could just go back in time a little bit and remind us of the last time you did a kind of junior subordinated note and the cost there and your overall experience and how that fit into the capital structure?","Donald Brown","Yes, thanks. So we've done two preferred equity issuances both last year through did a June issuances $400 million of 5.65%, and then a December 2018 issuance $500 million at 6.5%. So we're looking at structures like that that preferred equity structure allowed us to have about 50% equity credit with the rating agencies. So we do like that. We've also got a structure in place that allows us to call that that note in five years. And so it gives us some flexibility there as we look forward.","So that's one of the items that we are looking at potentially going forward. We've seen others in the industry take advantage of hybrids and prefer to in particular. And so it seems like the pricing as well as the understanding from investors says I think become a lot more clear in looks \u2013 continue to look like a viable opportunity for us.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. So kind of within the realm of different types of convertible debt or non-convertible kind of subordinated debt and preferred equity. It sounds like you're happy with the experience last year and investors are kind of well receiving of those types of issuances?","Donald Brown","Yes, absolutely. I'd say we continue to get investor support and questions of if we do it, please give them a call. And that's what we're trying to balance and understand as we look forward for our cash flow needs as well as ensuring we hit our credit targets.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And I guess, I just wanted to confirm, based on this slide and your message in the script today that kind of all elements of the 2019 and 2020 funding needs are reiterated. In other words, the ATM, the internal programs, the debt, et cetera. Even though part of that to TBD like no pieces of that have changed given your progress so far on the insurance?","Donald Brown","That's correct. That's correct.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And then just my other question is, given that progress, is there kind of any reason to waiver at all on your 5% to 7% EPS growth target of the 2019 base waiver as in kind of within the range or around the range?","Donald Brown","No. And as I said, we plan to give guidance for 2020 and beyond on our third quarter call.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. Thanks Don.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.","Steven Fleishman","Yes. Hey, good mornings. So just a brief question. In the past you've talked about potentially shifting maybe if we needed to a little bit of the equity ATM in the 2019 versus 2020, but I'm wondering now with the insurance money coming in pretty good, how are you feeling about whether you need to do that or not?","Donald Brown","Thanks Steve. I think it's something we're still looking at. It is still early, but certainly the insurance progress that we've made has been positive. And I think it's less likely that we would pull forward, but I think it's a little early for us to commit for this year. But as you said, if we were to do that, it would be a pull forward from 2020, so that on an average basis it's $200 million to $300 million a year.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just one thing just want to check is, I know you'll give 2020 guidance I guess on the Q3 call, but just your 5% to 7% growth rate is already kind of in place for the next several years. So unless something dramatic changes, we should generally just assume that is the rough growth rate?","Donald Brown","That's correct. Yes, that is our guidance.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Donald Brown","Thank you.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you, Steve. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. First question is in Indiana, I know you'd be giving your CapEx guidance in the third quarter earnings, but given the HB1470 legislation that was passed this spring on the TDSIC mechanism, any update on how much incremental investment exists beyond the base plan? Is it just more incremental in nature or do you see potentially bulkier opportunities there?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. Insoo, thanks. Insightful question. As you noted and we sort of already answered it, we'll guide 2020 on Q3, whether we have that level of specificity at that point in time remains unclear. As you noted, that mechanism is a TDSIC related mechanism. And so the more likely moment that we would talk about those capital plans would be when we file the next TDSIC filing, which maybe a little bit later than that. We're still working through that planning. All of that said, we do see an opportunity there for enhanced grid modernization investments and some key technology investments that our teams are working through as we go through this planning cycle.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And then more broadly, when you look at your overall portfolio of utilities and just longer term growth opportunities overall in the industry, is your preference to remain more exposed to gas versus electric? Whether it's organically or inorganic?","Joseph Hamrock","We like our mix. We always evaluate the performance and potential of not just the mix, but the individual companies and that's what drives our investment and our regulatory cycle and guides such decisions as what we'd like to mix to look like. But we like the position that we're in.","Insoo Kim","Great. Thank you very much.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed with your question.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Joseph Hamrock","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","Sorry, I hopped in couple of minutes late. Don, you specifically called out any sort of potential O&M update as a result of the SMS program as we head into the third quarter. Without going into specifics, do you kind of envision the O&M growth profile changing as a result of the programs?","Donald Brown","So the way I\u2019ll answer it, it's too early to provide any specific perspective, but we've certainly have kicked off SMS in a much more accelerated way this year. We've got a team looking at \u2013 I think there is 18 or 19 different work streams looking at our assets and our procedures and our risk management programs. And we're learning a lot about how we can enhance our operations.","And so I expect we will have some changes that come through and are delivered through across our seven states. Too early to say whether that changes our overall O&M program and profile, but certainly there will be some enhanced investment in our Gas Operations as we continue to implement SMS across the seven states.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay. That's helpful. And Joe, I obviously appreciate that you can't come around Maryland \u2013 Massachusetts in any kind of strategic things, but what sort of costs coming to light around expenditures and capital. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about the rate case in Massachusetts?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. We've talked about that throughout the year, Shahriar. It's a little early to set up the plans for the rate case or regulatory strategy more generally in Massachusetts. We've remained focused on restoration. We've remained focused on a positioning the company to move forward and the communities to move forward.","And the property insurance claim in particular relates to any potential regulatory strategy related to the capital investments in the Merrimack Valley. So there's a number of steps that would need to set up before we're able to talk about specific regulatory strategies. Of said before and would continue to say that that we wouldn't expect that to be any sooner than late this year or early next year before we're in a position to talk about that strategy.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it, thanks. That was it. Thank you, guys.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. You may proceed with your question.","Gregory Gordon","Hey, good morning, guys. A lot of my \u2013 if not all my questions were answered, but just to clarify, one thing. Your insurance recoveries have been pretty good. You show on that slide that you've gotten a significant portion of a $670 million of the $800 million of casualty already in the door.","Joseph Hamrock","That's correct.","Gregory Gordon","Are you thinking about sizing your financing needs against your assumed insurance recoveries? Are you assuming that you're ultimately going to be able to recover the full $1.1 billion of casualty and property insurance? Or are you assuming some risk adjustment against the property portion when we think about that in light of the total costs that you've currently incurred for the Greater Lawrence event today?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. So on the casualty insurance that the $800 million, and as you noted, we've booked about a $670 million receivable. We are certainly well into that process and conversations with our remaining insurance providers, so very confident in getting substantial portion of that, if not all of that $800 million.","The property insurance claim, we just filed a few weeks back. So it's very early in the process to talk about recovery, amount of recovery and timing of recovery. And so they are just now our provider having an opportunity to review the claim. It also note that part of that claim that we're working through that our insurance provider is looking for is to have more information about the assets that were damaged in the Merrimack Valley incident, and that's subject to the NTSB investigation right now.","So timing wise, this one is going \u2013 was always going to be a little slower. And we've got to work through that process with them. But as I said, through my notes earlier, we'll continue to provide updates quarterly on our overall insurance progress, including the property insurance.","Gregory Gordon","Okay, because as I think about the \u2013 your financing needs, which you've also been very clear on and gave us the update on incremental long-term debt. I mean with $1.68 billion to $1.69 billion of current estimated costs that that could theoretically create a $300 million swing factor, which I presume would be caught up in the non-convertible subordinated debt or preferred equity portion of the financings is that's the independent variable at this point. Is that fair or unfair?","Donald Brown","Yes. Absolutely that figures into our long-term financing needs, the amount and timing of the property insurance claim. But also looking at just our overall plan both capital and our operating plan. And so that's the process that we're in right now to really understand what are the different levers and how things are shaping up for 2020 and beyond. But property insurance figures into that and will impact financing obviously.","Gregory Gordon","Okay. But when you flex assumptions for different recoveries on the insurance, you still feel like you're comfortable inside that 5% to 7% earnings growth aspiration based on a reasonable risk adjustment for recoveries on the remaining insurance. That it's fair reason why you're still confident in the growth rate.","Donald Brown","Absolutely. Yes.","Gregory Gordon","Okay. Thank you.","Donald Brown","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. You may proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Good morning. I kicked this around with Randy a couple of weeks ago and if I got any of the numbers wrong, blame me, not them, but to replace the coal plants who are retiring, a little over 2,500 megawatts of capacity. You've got three big wind projects, roughly 800 megawatts so you still have around 1,700 megawatts there'll be future RFPs, I assume. What piece of that would you anticipate being from in probably gas of that 1,700 megawatts. I'm just assuming all of it can't be intermittent solar or wind.","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. Insightful question, Charles. And the best place to start would be to look back at the IRP from last year. And that reflected a long-term view based off of the RFP we took last year, which was from memory about a 65, 35, 65 renewables, 35 natural gas from capacity. And keep in mind in the MISO market, we're about three gigawatts out of 102 or so gigawatts. So it's a bigger equation than our own standalone portfolio is another way to think about that with transmission. The strength of the transmission system there.","All of that said, the key driver in the way we've set this up is that we can step through time and reevaluate the market and the planning portfolio as we stepped through time. So that 800 is nameplate that is not the credit you get in the capacity market for that.","And so it's a relatively small portion of the overall portfolio and it's a way to start the process, kind of fills in for the loss of Bailey, the retirement of Bailey and doesn't really yet start the progression to replace the plants we would retire in 2023 and ultimately in 2028. So it's a pretty dynamic step through time approach to this that will answer that question iteratively as we go.","Charles Fishman","So roughly of the 2,500 megawatts of coal retirements, roughly you're saying one-third would have to be natural gas. Would any of that be a combined cycle or do you think it'd be all peaking at this point?","Joseph Hamrock","And I'm not saying would have to be then I want to be careful about what you're hearing. It's not would have to be, it's the IRP that we ran last year showed about that makes and that accounted our existing Sugar Creek combined cycle station. So I'm talking about the total portfolio, not the replacement portfolio.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Interesting Times. Thank you.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock for any further remarks.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks Josh. And thanks to all of you for tuning in today on a bit what I know is a busy day for you. And thanks for your ongoing interest and support. We look forward to continuing engagement with you as we step through the remainder of the year. Make it a good and safe day. Have a good one.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report on our first quarter 2019 results, which reflect our team\u2019s continued execution of our long-term utility infrastructure modernization program. These programs are the foundation of our focus on safety and enhancements to our GAAP distribution system across all seven states.","In addition, we continue to advance our electric generation strategy in Indiana and our dedicated team continues to support customers and communities in the Merrimack Valley during Phase II of our restoration work. With the progress we have made thus far, NiSource is well positioned to deliver on its commitments for 2019.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3, which summarizes our key accomplishments through the first quarter and early second quarter of the year.","We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.82 per share versus $0.77 in 2018 in line with expectations and positioning us to deliver net operating earnings per share within our $1.27 to a $1.33 guidance range for 2019. We also continue to expect to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments in 2019 in line with our guidance.","We remain confident in our long-term forecast of 5% to 7% annual growth of our non-GAAP earnings per share and dividend from 2019 through 2022 and capital investments of $1.6 billion to $2 billion annually from 2020 through 2022.","Gas system safety enhancements remain a key focus across our seven state footprint. We are executing on our accelerated safety management system or SMS implementation. Our SMS is aligned with a framework developed for pipeline operators by the American petroleum institute.","SMS is a comprehensive approach to managing safety, emphasizing continual assessment and improvement and identifying and mitigating potential operational risks proactively. To provide independent review and oversight of our SMS implementation we have established the quality review Board Chaired by former U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray Lahud.","In addition to Mr. Lahud the five member QRB includes experts with diverse backgrounds spanning the aviation, energy and nuclear industry. I'm honored that Secretary Lahud agreed to Chair our QRB, which has begun its work and is providing significant benefits through the experience and expertise of all five members.","I can also report progress on our commitment to install over pressurization protection, automatic shut off devices on low pressure systems. Initial pilot projects have been completed and work has begun across all of our operating areas.","These devices operate like circuit breakers, they are designed so that when they sense operating pressures that is too high or too low they immediately shut down gas to the system, regardless of the cause. This work remains a top priority.","Our gas team continues to execute on the regulatory initiatives with the unanimous settlement filed in our Virginia base rate case, approvals of modernization tracker update in Ohio and Massachusetts and the first annual update application filed in our new capital expenditure program in Ohio.","In Indiana we filed a partial settlement last week with key stakeholders in our electric base rate case which addresses our revenue requirements Federal Tax Reform and depreciation schedules related to the early retirement of our coal plants.","And our electric team continues to advance our generation strategy with our wind farm applications filed and awaiting regulatory approval. Customer support efforts continue in the Merrimack Valley as well, with the end of the winter heating season work has begun to replace heating equipment that was repaired in the weeks after the mid September event.","Approximately 875 customers are receiving new finances or boilers with installations expected to be completed by September 15th of this year. Our team continues to process customer claims, provide repair support on appliances in heating equipment and restore private and community property effected by last fall\u2019s restoration work.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald.","Donald Brown","Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter results on Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about, $308 million or $0.82 per share compared with about $260 million or $0.77 per share for the same period in 2018.","The biggest driver of our non-GAAP financial performance continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments supported by constructive regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers.","Before turning our business segment financial results, I would just like to address Greater Lawrence incident expenses. Our estimates which are detailed on Slide 10 are higher than what we have provided with our fourth quarter 2018 results. This increase was driven by final billings for construction and emergency response expenses as we as adjustments made to reserves for legal liability and settlement expenses.","Despite this upward adjustment, our strong first quarter financial results coupled with our solid execution on the regulatory front has of confident in reaffirming both our 2019 non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance range of $1.27 to $1.33, as well as our long-term earnings and dividend growth forecast. We also expect to maintain our current financing plan.","As we have previously stated, we have $800 million of cash for the insurance coverage and 300 million of property insurance that we expect will recover a substantial portion of our Greater Lawrence incident cost.","We have started submitting claims in December 2018, and have recorded casualty insurance recoveries of $235 million through March 31st. We have also provided notice to our property insurer and discussions around the claims and recovery have begun. As the insurance recovery process move forward we will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress.","Let's turn now to the non-GAAP financial results for our business segment. Our gas distribution operation segments has operating earnings of about $398 million for the quarter. Compared with about $320 million for the same period in 2018. The increase of $78 million was driven primarily by regulatory outcomes and infrastructure replacement program execution.","Our electric operation segment reported operating earnings of about $95 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $86 million for the comparable period in 2018. This increase driven primarily by tracked infrastructure investments and lower O&M expenses offset slightly by reduced customer usage.","Now turning to Slide 5. I would like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our total debt level as of March 31st was about $9.2 billion of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 18 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%.","At the end of the first quarter we maintained net available liquidity of about $1 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations. Our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we are committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings.","I would now like to turn to Slide 6, which covers our financing plan for our long-term growth investments. Our current plan continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our aftermarket or ATM equity issuance program and $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs, plus incremental long-term debt.","Our ATM is consistent with our approach to provide balance predictable financing for our infrastructure investments. The current ATM program allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020. Execution of our financing plan is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metrics to the 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.","Now, I will turn the call back to Joe who will discuss a few infrastructure investments and regulatory highlights.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you Donald. Now let\u2019s turn to some specific highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2019 from our gas operations on Slide 7. In Virginia we filed our unanimous settlement agreement last months with parties to our base rate case, which remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission.","Filed in August 2018, our request seeks to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from Federal Tax Reform. If approved is filed the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $9.5 million including $8.2 million in revenues currently collected through our infrastructure tracker.","New rates went into effect subject to refund with the February billing cycle. We expect to commission order in the second half of 2019. In Ohio we received regulatory approval last week of our infrastructure replacement program tracker annual adjustments allowing us to begin recovery of approximately $200 million of infrastructure investments made in 2018.","This well established pipeline replacement program authorized through 2022 covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines.","Also in Ohio, we filed in February our first annual application for adjustments to our capital expenditure program writer. The CEP writer which was first approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio in 2018, allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through our infrastructure modernization tracker.","The adjustment application seeks to being recovery of approximately a $122 million of capital invested in 2018. A PUCL order is expected in August 2019.","In Indiana our PHMSA compliance plans covering approximately $230 million of capital expected to be invested between 2019 and 2023 remains pending before the Indiana utility regulatory commission. We expecting an order in the second half of 2019.","And just yesterday, we received regulatory approval of our 2019 Gas System Enhancement Plan and not the chooses. This order authorizes recovery of incremental 2019 capital investments of $64 million and new rates take effect this month.","I would note that this order recovers capital investment and priority pipe replacement that will be done this calendar year and does not include cost recovery related to the Greater Lawrence incident.","Now let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 8. As I mentioned earlier, we filed a partial settlement agreement on April 26th in our electric base rate case, which remains pending before the IURC.","The settlement addresses our revenue, requirement Federal Tax Reform and depreciation, schedules related to the early retirement of our coal-fired generation plants called for in our 2018 integrated resource. If approved is file the settlement is earnings neutral and allows for return on equity of 9.9%. An IURC order is anticipated in the second half of 2019.","Our filings seeking approval to develop three wind farm in Indiana in partnership with experienced renewable energy developers remain pending before the IURC, with orders expected in the third quarter of 2019.","The three projects, Jordan Creek, Roaming Bison and Rosewater, have nameplate capacity totaling 800 megawatts and are expected to be in operation by late 2020. These filings made February 1st are consistent with our 2018 Integrated Resource Plan, submitted to the IURC last fall.","The IRP calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next five years, and all coal generation to be retired by 2028. The replacement capacity portfolio is still being fully defined and options point toward lower-cost renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and battery storage technology.","We expect to announce additional renewable projects and issue a second round of our RFPs later this year. Our goal is to transition to the most economical cleanest electric supply mix available, while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for future technology and market changes.","Our coal combustion residuals capital projects are substantially complete with the last of the three units placed into service in the first quarter. These projects represents an investment of approximately $193 million and include environmental upgrades at generating facilities to meet current EPA standards.","The IURC in December 2017 approved its settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated cost. We continue to execute on our seven year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improved system safety and reliability.","The IURC approved key disc program represents approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. Our latest tracker update request filed in January and covering approximately $59 million of incremental capital investments made from June 2018 through November 2018, remains pending before the IURC. And order is expected in the second quarter of 2019.","I should note that there is new legislation in Indiana, which make several constructive changes to the T DISC Statue. The law which underlies and further supports our gas and electric infrastructure modernization programs at NIPSCO.","For legislation House Enrolled Act 1470 provides some clarity around what can be included in T DISC plans. Our team is putting together a proposed timeline for filing a new gas T DISC plan with a filing day expected in the third quarter of 2019 and we are determining next steps resulted to the electric plan. We will continue to execute on the current approved gas plan through 2020 as well as the current electric plan approved through 2022.","Before I touch on our key takeaways for the quarter, I will share a few quick updates. I'm pleased to report that last month NiSource was named for the fourth consecutive year to Forbes Magazine\u2019s list of Americas Best Large Employers. Inclusion on this list, which is based on an independent employee survey reinforces that our 8000 plus employees recognized the Company as a great place to work, grow and build a career.","Our team is dedicated to building value for our customers, our communities and our investors. If you haven\u2019t already done so, I encourage you to check out our 2018 integrated annual report, which we published last month and is available at NiSource.com.","The report shares how we are continuing to invest in safety upgrades and infrastructure enhancements, deliver on our financial and environmental commitments build our culture and enhance the sustainability of NiSource for years to come.","I would also like to recognize and thank Rich Thomson who is retiring this month from the NiSource Board of Directors after having served on the Board since 2004 including the last six years as Chairman. His thoughtful and inspiring leadership will be missed and we wish Rich the best in his well in retirement.","We are just about ready to open the line to your questions, but let me share our key takeaways. We are off to a strong start in 2019 both in terms of our financial results and our solid execution on the regulatory front in each business segment.","As a result, we are confident and reaffirming our 2019 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range of a $1.27 to a $1.33 per share and our financing plan. Our long-term investment driven growth plan is intact and resilient.","We continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually from 2019 through 2022 and we expect to maintain our investment grade credit ratings.","Safety remains a foundation for all that we do for our customers and the communities we serve and we are advancing that commitment with our accelerated SMS implementation across our seven state footprint and strong independent oversight from our Quality Review Board.","We are making significant progress in our electric business with partial settlement of our base rate case and advancing our generation strategy with our wind projects. We are committed to finishing the restoration in the Merrimack Valley the right way as we continue to support our customers and communities there.","Thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest in support of NiSource. We are now ready to take your questions. Deranda.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein","Hi this is Mike, how are you doing, good morning. I\u2019m wondering, if you could discuss a little bit about the differences between the IRP in Indiana that you guys filed and one that Vectren recently field and had a rejection of their CCGT certificate of need. You know how does your IRP differ from that and maybe what are the lessons learned from the combination of the two processes that have happened here?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. Thanks Mike. I won't opine on the Vectren IRP, but I will talk about our approach and for us the first principle throughout the entire process have included a transparent evaluation of all of the viable options that we saw for replacement capacity in particular and then tested that through an RFP a transact able RFP last year with the broadest possible stakeholder participation. And we believe this approach stands up well as the IURC evaluates our filings our CPCN filings, that of course follow that IRP and are consistent with that strategy.","And we will continue to move through this process embracing those principles including later this year as I noted earlier our expectation for an next round of RFPs to continue to show what is available in the market and what the best solutions will be for our replacement capacity going forward. I think the IURC and all of our stakeholders value that approach and have been very engaged in that approach throughout.","Michael Weinstein","And on the same subject the seed of SP472, what do you think that says about the political lobby of some state and I guess the power of the coal industry in particular going forward?","Joseph Hamrock","You know I would say it's not surprising, it's not unexpected that various groups would try to protect their interest and we certainly welcome that this course and welcome the opportunity to discuss that and again it all risks on our approach of putting all the options on the table and making sure that we can all see as objective and transparent picture as possible. And I think that stands up well as we move forward through what by any measure the pretty dynamic and complex transition in Indiana in particular, but in general across the country.","Michael Weinstein","Do you think we will see a new type of replacement builds for that that try to achieve the same thing or do you think that this issue of a moratorium is dead for the time being?","Joseph Hamrock","I think it's too early to try to predict all that. It does appear that the more moratorium is off the table right now, we are proceeding on the course that we were on before, all of those activities, but we will continue to monitor that and we will continue to look forward attractive one on here and we expect that to be the case.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. Thank you very much. That is all I have for now.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning. Excellent. So I just wanted to be actually clear about Michael was just asking about. So again just to come back to this whole process in Indiana here on the electric side. At the end of the day the issues they are very discreet and legislative and peer companies out there and any implications with respect to your settlement that you have just filed and or future procurement plans are not existing or present. And maybe if you can talk about - let's go and talk a little bit more about what the remaining issues are that weren\u2019t settled here, just to go through sort of the remaining items as you look to close that out?","Joseph Hamrock","Sure thing. Yes again I don\u2019t see significant implications for us. We have said all along that each company really is going to see a unique set of factors and circumstances that drive our IRP process in general, the retirement of our assets, the evaluation of that is unique to the age and the operating conditions of our assets, you can\u2019t transpose that on any other company. I think we would all agree with that.","We did as I noted earlier test the market, so I think we have given a pretty clear and transparent picture of all the options available to us and so I wouldn\u2019t expect the process that is in front of us to substantially change that.","And as I said earlier, we will continue to commit to that kind of transparency to ensure that we are looking at all the options as we step through this progression of sequence of retirements and replacement capacity overtime.","So I think we are in a really good position here. I don\u2019t expect the review and the stakeholder process to setup at the legislature to substantially change our outlook. And as we noted earlier, a lot of this is further out on the horizon for us, so we have time to navigate the dynamics of this situation.","As it relates to the rate case, I would remind us that for us this was a policy case at its core, at the very beginning designed to align with our IRP and our generation strategy. The core issue being depreciation of the generation assets as it relates to the retirement schedule.","With the partial settlement that we have setting revenue requirements that effectively sets that piece of the puzzle in place, which is not the most important point, but the key for us as it relates to the overall strategy.","The open issues are related to allocation of revenue requirements among the customer groups, which has not solved and is always complex. We will continue to facilitate and support parties communicating in that that may ultimately result in litigated case. And that is okay, that is something that is what the process is for.","And then the other piece for us is within the revenue allocation the question of the industrial tariff that we set up for the large industrial is a part of that puzzle. We continue to work with parties on that as well.","So we feel good about the position that we are in on all fronts here as it relates to IRP, the wind CPC and in the rate case the relationship with the rate case settlements that we have. Donald anything you want to add to that?","Donald Brown","Yes. I would add that think about the process we ran last year for the IRP including that RFP the current projects that we have contracted with and have filed for approval on those projects, they were really to fill a gap we had on our Bailey plants that we shut down last year.","And so as we think about going forward on retiring the Schahfer units in 2023, we will need to go through another IRP process and we plan to issue another RFP to seek supply resources to replace that generation when we close out.","So, it\u2019s an opportunity for us to give feedback on our old process, the process last year as well as Vectren and others in the state so that we structure our next IRP and RFP to make sure that all of our stakeholders understand and have clarity around our plans in the markets going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. If I can follow-up just on the basic side of the equation. Can you elaborate a little bit more on your confidence level on just the latest round of increases in total cost of that. If you can I know this is a little bit difficult and then separately progress on any strategic decisions, rate case, timing and or financing implications for me in the latest increase. I imagine just that financing is most far?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes, Julien let me take the first part of that now and I will ask Donald to touch on the financing. I will note and Donald touched on this in the earlier remarks, but several factors drove the change to the cost estimates this quarter, which were up approximately 20% from prior estimates.","Those factors include finalizing emergency response and construction cost, billing as well as adjusting legal liability and settlement reserves based on our current view. And despite these adjustments, we are confident in reaffirming our 2019 guidance our long-term annual growth rate and maintaining our current financing plan.","And I think it's important to note that key drivers for us is always include regulatory timing and out outcomes and financing cost and timing and in the cycle that we are in were also drivers within our range include timing of insurance recoveries as it relates to the cash flows here.","So we will continue to provide updates each quarter as it relates to all of these factors, but I do feel like we continue to put more of this in the rearview mirror than not. Donald.","Donald Brown","Yes. I think Joe said it, as we look forward and look at the estimates that we have got, the items that we are working on are around settlements with parties, in having started those discussions between the different parties third-party claimants, we have got more information, but certainly as we continue having those discussions those estimates could be updated and will be updated in future quarters.","And to Joe's comment around the insurance recovery, we continue to progress there and it's steady, weekly conversation that we were having with all of our insurance providers in the tower is very constructive and were just progressing up the tower.","So we have got confidence that we continue to move in that path to get recovery on the insurance side and on other side from a claims and reserves on our litigation we are moving forward there as well.","Joseph Hamrock","And Julien, you asked about the regulatory. We haven't made any decisions at this point about regulatory plans in Massachusetts, as it relates to the investments in pipeline replacement in the Merrimack Valley. As we have noted before, and as it is noted here, we are working with our property insurance on that side and we will go to that process before we make any determination on the regulatory front.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Alright, I will leave it there. Thank you very much for your patience.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you. Have a great day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. Just going back to the cost estimates from that shift, it's acknowledging that the larger increase did come from the third-party claims could potentially fluctuate based on negotiations and what not. Could you elaborate on why it seems to be a bit difficult to get to more comprehensive estimate at this time just given the quarter - the increase from fourth quarter that you guys had estimated. And just up really from the settlement that has been failed, does any has been filed on the claims, have they been a face value or some level below that?","Joseph Hamrock","So let\u2019s start with the insurance cost and recovery there. Certainly there is a process to go through each claim, understand the claims, how we made decisions on the claims process.","The first couple of insurance providers and our tower has been very constructive and consistent. We haven\u2019t seen at this point any significant concerns about the cost that we incurred for the restoration events and the construction events last year.","And so at this point we are confident in that process and certainly we will continue to have conversations as we walk through each of those claims. But we have provided the full amount of the costs and our estimates to all of our insurance provider and so they are all seeing that information and now it\u2019s really the process going through provided-by-provider as they work through their process to get comfort with the costs.","On the other third-party claims and litigation reserves, I would say the big change really is the timing of having conversations. You think about where we were at year end, at the time we were still finishing up the restoration and so it really have allowed us here in the first quarter to start having conversations with the different third-parties, whether that is the municipalities or other claims that - larger reserves and litigation reserves that we have had here in the first quarter.","So it did have the announcement earlier this week about one of the significant injury claims that we were able to settle and so that is certainly in our reserve estimate and we will continue to have more conversations with the different third-parties.","Insoo Kim","Understood and then on the financing front, I know that plan hasn\u2019t really changed, but is there any clarity you could give or any level you could give on the preferred equity front, I know it\u2019s always kind of a TBD amount for 2019 and 2020.","Joseph Hamrock","Yes it\u2019s still early, as we said the amount of preferred equity that we may need will depend on the cash flow this year and in particular the timing and amount of the insurance recovery. So it\u2019s too early at this point, but it\u2019s still something that we are looking at as an opportunity this year.","Insoo Kim","Got it. Thank you very much.","Joseph Hamrock","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Turnure","Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to follow-up I think Joe on your comments on HP1470 and kind of how that impacts your longer term plans, how your filing will kind of come together on the gas side there in end of sell with the exploration of the existing T DISC?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. So thanks Chris good morning. The T DISC statue that is now passed brings substantial clarity for all of us regarding eligible investments, it also provides opportunities for advanced technology investments on the electric side, as well as targeted economic development investments on the electric side, which is a great feature.","So as we look at the new gas plant, we are in a cycle where we would want to be updating anyways, since the current plan runs through 2020. So it will just set us up to file for the next plan, so to speak.","On the electric side, we are evaluating the opportunities that might exist or the options that might exist as a result of the legislation. And we may or may not file a new plan there. We are continuing to evaluate that, because the electric plant runs through 2022.","So it's more about the clarity that it brings in how much value that might provide for all stakeholders as we step through the next couple of years.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you Joe.","Joseph Hamrock","Alright. Thank you, Chris. Have a good day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fleishman","Hi, good morning. Hey, so just maybe you could just kind of tie us back to the - you do have couple of $100 million insurance increase, but really no change in your comfort level on financing plan and credit. Is that kind of a reflection that the rest of the business is doing a little better or you are getting a little more confident on timing of the insurance recoveries?","Donald Brown","Thanks Steve. Good morning. I think that's right, I think as we continue to progress both from conversations with our insurance providers having the NIPSCO electric rate case, having that partial settlement in especially the acceleration of the depreciation for the closure plants that has a positive cash impact annually to our business, as well as we look forward at the different regulatory items, we have got.","That, ultimately, we have got confidence in our long-term plan. But at the same time, we will continue to work with our insurance providers on really the timing of those cash flows and getting the initially 800 million back and then also seeking recovery on the property insurance side, which helps offset the higher costs that we have incurred.","Steven Fleishman","Okay, and I guess, do you have enough certainty with a risk of future increases to the point where you - what is the risk, I guess that we come in future quarters and certainly have to add more financing or other stuff to deal to preserve credit? Or do you have enough visibility now that's unlikely?","Donald Brown","Yes, I think it's always possible. I'm not going to say that our reserves could not change as we continue down settlement discussions with third-parties. But from the information we have now, we are confident in the reserves we have got and estimates we have at this time.","If you think about financing, again, it's really going to change depending on the timing of insurance recoveries. And so that might impact needing more equity content in 2019 to ensure we hit our targets for this year, but that's really a timing between, 2019 and 2020 and doesn\u2019t impact our long-term financing plan.","Steven Fleishman","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey guys. So I think you touched on most of it, but let me ask I'm still trying to get a sense on how you are thinking about the rate case in Massachusetts, because you guys obviously have a higher - the claims have jumped up so the lag is increasing. With sort of some of the increase in confidence level you guys have around your discussions and insurance recoveries, I guess what is holding you back from filing a rate case?","Joseph Hamrock","I wouldn\u2019t say that we are being held back, we are progressing through a series of restoration activities. As it relates to some of the claims there is really no relationship between the claims issues and the rate case itself, except we on the properties side, which I noted earlier where we are looking at the investments we made there.","And we do want to make sure we proceed through the insurance process before we establish a strategy for the regulatory. So I wouldn\u2019t call that holding it back, I think it\u2019s just order of operations so to speak before we determine what the best course of action would be on the regulatory side.","Any other thing I would note is we did pull a settlement last year so we have got some work to do to get back to where we were before we even put the replacement investments into the rate base last year. So we have got some things to work through, but it\u2019s not about being held back, it\u2019s really about an orderly process to get to the best strategy.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just are you still - from a timing perspective we should be thinking about for modeling Q4 maybe early 2020 for a filing?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. I think what we have said before is it will be late this year early next year before we make decisions. So it wasn\u2019t about the timing of a case, but it was about the timing of a decision.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay got it. Thanks guys that was my main questions.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks Shahriar. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Gregory Gordon","Thanks. You know what guys I think you have been pretty thorough and my questions have been answered. Have a good day.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you too.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Fishman from Morningstar Research. Your line is open.","Charles Fishman","Yes thank you. Just one quick one Joe, does this pending legislation in Indiana move the needle as I'm looking at your Slide 12, in other words that 24% of your infrastructure investment 2020 to 2022 comes from periodic rate cases. Is it material enough to lower that number 100 or 200 basis points or is it really insignificant?","Joseph Hamrock","Hi good morning Charles. That is a great question I think it\u2019s too early to tell. I think it\u2019s back to the point I made a few minutes ago about evaluating some of the new features in the TDISC statue, especially around economic development and advanced technologies.","So grid modernization in particular, some advanced grids investments might be a good opportunity that would have been in traditional rate cases where not for this legislation. We will evaluate that it could move that line, but right now it\u2019s too early for us to say that with any clarity.","Charles Fishman","Okay, got it. That is all I had thank you.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you. Have a great day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Levi form ExodusPoint. Your line is now open.","Andrew Levi","Hi guys, and I apologize for asking this because I haven't really been on the cost, but just on the liabilities, what were you guys saying as far say Europe is like billion dollars now, is the likelihood of that increasing significantly not likely or likely just kind of - everything kind of around that? I'm sorry that I missed it so.","Donald Brown","Good morning Andy, no problem. I think what I stated was that it's certainly possible that as we continue to have litigation settlement discussions that the reserves could be adjusted in the future, but based upon the information we have got, as well as our progress and discussions this quarter we are confident and where those reserves are.","Andrew Levi","So you say you have taken access beyond what has been claimed I guess is what you are saying, is that right? So whatever you took this quarter and you have taken is an estimate of where it may go, not what has actually been filed.","Donald Brown","Yes. It would be our estimate of where were going - what settlement amount would be for the major third-party claims.","Andrew Levi","Right okay and that is higher than what is been already filed or not.","Donald Brown","The filed - what do you mean by filing?","Andrew Levi","Well, I mean you know like whether lawsuits or claims or things like that those amounts relative to what you have reserved.","Donald Brown","Well they are higher than what we had in our fourth quarter results. In some cases there hasn\u2019t been a filing of cases, but we started having discussions with third-parties. So it depends on really with the third-party, kind of what the status is from a legal standpoint as well as our discussions.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And then my last question is just in general, I don\u2019t know if you want to answer this, but is it possible that some of the claims could be inflated or not real, have you experienced that or has there been a discussions around that.","Donald Brown","We are having constructive conversations, we are trying to understand the third-parties and their claims and how they have made up their claims and that's part of the process of settlement discussions its really understanding how they have made up their claims.","Andrew Levi","Okay. I will follow-up Randy offline.","Joseph Hamrock","Its Joe here. The other things I would note is the adjustments this quarter are not all related to claims and litigation, there is a number of other factors driving it. So I just don\u2019t want you to walk away thinking that whole adjustment was based on claims alone. As I noted earlier, and as Donald noted, it was also true ups to some of the restoration costs from last year, some of the mutual assistance cost, so there is a lot of different things moving inside that adjustment that we have booked this quarter.","Andrew Levi","Okay. I will follow-up with Randy. Thank you very much guys.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks. Have a good day Andy.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey guys, sorry just to come back very Quickly, the TDISC plan that you expected to file later this year. I would imagine that doesn\u2019t change your near year CapEx for instance based on the reasoning for it, but I suspect that adding greater than you - adding back potentially some of the CapEx that might have been pushed out given the ambiguity earlier and the reason for the legislation itself, you could actually see that reintroduced and increased. I just want to understand what your current assumption is relative to the baseline in TDISC and how that could be updated as you think about it later this year?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. Are you talking about the gas side Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Admittedly both sides.","Joseph Hamrock","Okay, yes. On the gas side, possibly I don\u2019t think we have enough clarity to go back and sort of back cast what we originally filed. Keep in mind those are pretty small changes in the original plan as we adjusted through the various filings. So even if it was kind of a back to where we were it\u2019s not a significant shift there. On the electric side it\u2019s possibly a little more interesting as we look at advanced technologies and some of those, but too early to say that with clarity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Alright. I will leave it there. Thank you.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Hamrock, CEO for closing remarks.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you Deranda and thanks all of you for your participation today and your continued interest in, in support of NiSource.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to Randy Hulen. You may begin.","Randy G. Hulen - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NiSource quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer. The purpose of today's call is to review NiSource's financial performance for the second quarter of 2016 as well as provide an update on our utility operations and growth drivers. We'll then open the call up to your questions.","Please note, we will be referring to supplemental earnings slides during this call. These slides are available on our website. Also on our website is a document which contains segment and financial information to accompany this presentation.","Before turning the call over to Joe, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","Additionally, some statements made on this conference call relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and supplemental segment and financial information available on NiSource.com. In that document, you'll also find our full financial schedules that have historically been available in our earnings release.","With all that covered, I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Randy. And good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Let's start on page three of our supplemental slides. With 12 months of execution behind us since the separation of our interstate pipeline business, NiSource is well positioned as a premier pure-play regulated utility with a solid long-term business plan based on large-scale infrastructure modernization programs.","Since well before the separation, we've been building momentum, executing our electric and gas investment and regulatory programs, while enhancing our focus on customer service across our seven states.","I'm more confident than ever that we've got the right plan and the right team in place to deliver on the commitments we've outlined for customers and shareholders. Reflecting that confidence on the strength of our first six months of performance in 2016 and recent execution highlights, we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings for 2016 of $1.05 per share to $1.10 per share, a narrowing of our $1 per share to $1.10 per share guidance that we originally announced about 15 months ago.","And now to our results for the second quarter, the NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.08 per share with strong execution of our construction program and in part taking advantage of favorable weather, we now expect to make nearly $1.5 billion of utility infrastructure investments in 2016. These well-established programs across our footprint are improving safety, reliability, service and environmental performance for our customers and communities.","Highlighting our continued regulatory progress, in July, we received commission approval on both the NIPSCO electric base rate case and long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. And our regulatory activity at our Columbia companies remains on schedule with rate cases in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania on track for expected commission orders by the end of the year, with Virginia to follow closely behind in early 2017. Notably, we reached a settlement in Maryland just last week. We'll talk more about each of these in a few minutes.","Supplementing the value delivered through our ongoing infrastructure strategy is a strong sustainable and growing dividend, which we continue to project will increase by 4% to 6% each year; and on May 11, we delivered on that commitment by increasing our annualized dividend by 6.5%.","Our credit ratings are stable and improving and our liquidity position remains solid at $619 million. And just last month Fitch upgraded its rating of NiSource from BBB minus to BBB, and we maintain our investment grade ratings of BBB plus and Baa2 with stable outlooks at Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively.","As you can see, strong performance continued in the second quarter with additional progress already in place for the third quarter. Let's turn the call to Donald to review our financial results in more detail. You can find those on page four of our supplemental slides and in our segment and financial information available in the Investors section of NiSource.com.","Donald?","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Thanks and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered second quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $26 million, or $0.08 per share, compared with about $1 million, or $0.00 per share in 2015.","On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $134 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $32 million over the same period in 2015. On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $29 million for the quarter versus a loss of about $73 million in the second quarter of 2015.","The biggest drivers of our performance continue to be the impact of our long-term regulatory program and infrastructure investments. Our gas distribution operations delivered operating earnings of about $73 million, an increase of more than $17 million, primarily attributable to new base rate at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure replacement program.","Our electric operations reported operating earnings of about $64 million, an increase of more than $7 million, primarily attributable to increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments. While Joe mentioned it earlier, I wanted to reiterate that we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 per share to $1.10 per share for the year.","Now turning to slide five, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $7.3 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.7%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $619 million consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment, and regulatory highlights.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I wanted to flag for you our latest sustainability report, which was published in June. The report highlights how we're delivering on our commitments to safety, customer satisfaction, system enhancements and being recognized among the best places to work. The report provides stakeholders with a glimpse into our continued sustainability efforts, a key component of our business plan. This report is available at NiSource.com.","And a significant enhancement for our customers was introduced in May, a redesigned bill across our seven states. The new bill format features user-friendly updates to make it easier to read and understand. Consistent with our efforts to collaborate with stakeholders, customer feedback was a key input into the design of the new bill.","So, let's turn to some highlights from our gas operations on slide six. At NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its seven-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system, reliability and safety. Supporting this investment, on June 22, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC approved the company's semi-annual tracker update. This update covered an incremental $72 million of investments through the end of 2015 and will increase annual revenues by $6.7 million.","On May 27, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with ongoing initiatives to improve system, safety and reliability. If approved as filed, this case would increase annual revenues by about $25 million.","Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case is progressing on schedule with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The case seeks to adjust base rates in support of our continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure, and to recover increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The case also includes enhanced provisions for customer growth. If approved as filed, the case would result in a $55 million annual revenue increase. I would note that productive settlement discussions are taking place in this case.","Also in Pennsylvania, we opened our first of four centralized employee training centers. The $10 million, 22,000-square-foot facility includes simulators, a safety town and other hands-on training designed to help develop our next generation of talent. This is an exciting investment that supports long-term sustainability by helping us attract and retain some of the best talent in the industry.","Other facilities are in the planning stages in Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts. Columbia Gas of Virginia's base rate case remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request, seeks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability and to enable increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million.","At Columbia Gas of Maryland, the company on July 27 filed a joint settlement agreement in its base rate case with the staff of the Maryland Public Service Commission and the Maryland Office of People's Counsel. The proposed settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. The case filed in April seeks to adjust base rates to support the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. New rates are expected to be in effect in November 2016.","We expect commission decisions in Pennsylvania and Kentucky by the end of the year and again in Virginia in early 2017. As you can see, our teams are successfully executing all phases of our plan, and you'll see similar themes at our electric business.","Now let's turn to slide seven. As I mentioned at the start of the call, the NIPSCO team reached significant milestones with commission approval of settlements in both its electric base rate case and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. On July 18, the IURC approved an agreement that NIPSCO reached with key stakeholders in its electric base rate case. The approved settlement agreement provides a platform for continued investments and service improvements. New rates go into effect on October 1 and will increase annual revenues by $72.5 million.","And on July 12, the IURC approved NIPSCO's seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program settlement. With more than $1.2 billion of planned investments, the IURC's decision provides a clear path to continue making the necessary upgrades to our electric infrastructure in Northern Indiana now and into the future.","And last, but not least, NIPSCO's two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with the anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right away acquisition, permitting and engineering are well under way for both projects with line construction in its early stages.","And before opening the call to questions, I'd like to touch on our ongoing commitments. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on our $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014. These system modernization plans continue to deliver value for all stakeholders across our seven states.","Our capital investment plan for 2016 has been updated from approximately $1.4 billion to nearly $1.5 billion, driven by our team's high-performance execution and supported by favorable weather conditions for construction so far this year. As we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, we've focused our earnings guidance for the year and now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10.","While we are not yet providing guidance or investment plans for 2017, this 2016 earnings guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%.","I'm particularly proud of our employees. Through their talent and dedication to serving our customers, we are delivering on our commitments, which are focused on industry-leading safety performance and top-tier customer service. Our balanced and constructive strategy is designed to sustain performance and continue delivering on these commitments well into the future.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.","Now, let's open the call to your questions. Michelle?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Joe, I was hoping you could kind of give us an update to your thinking on longer-term rate base growth now that we have the final decision in the general rate case on the electric side as well as the (16:45) program there. And given the fact that you have had the confidence to up your CapEx number for 2016 at least, how has your kind of thinking and your confidence level changed, if at all, over the past, call it, six months?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","These updates for this year are unique to the momentum we've built through a fairly favorable weather conditions during the first half of the year are not intended to convey an outlook for the future years.","We continue to remain committed to 4% to 6% earnings per share growth and dividend growth over the planning horizon. But very confident in our execution, as we have been, and noting the orders that you pointed out, Chris, we've continued to invest even through the regulatory execution of the (17:40) proceeding and the rate case with real commitment to making those investments over the long-term. So, if anything, just confidence in the support that we have for the investments we've long planned.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the potential for customer growth, can you kind of remind us where you are year-to-date, how that is tracking versus your expectations and kind of what you're thinking for the full-year 2016? I know you're in the relatively early stages of some of your customer growth initiatives there, but that's obviously an important part of the growth going forward, so an update, I think, would be helpful.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you for that, Chris. As you noted, we're at the very, very early stages of implementation of some of our enhanced growth strategies, recently having begun to implement some of our pilot programs in Indiana and Pennsylvania that represent enhanced focus on growth opportunities and outreach.","So not yet seeing any measurable impact of those enhanced strategies; probably more notably, as I said, in a number of the rate case updates, our regulatory strategy has been focused in part on enhancing the ability to attract new customers with programs that support the upfront \u2013 relief on the upfront cost for new customers or conversion customers. We've seen support for that across most of the jurisdictions.","Year-to-date as we stand here, we're \u2013 on a gross basis, so we often talk of attrition on the customer count as well; but on a gross base, we're running about 10% ahead of where we were at this time last year, driven predominantly by \u2013 and this varies across our territory, but by strong housing starts in certain parts of the territory, notably in Virginia, we've seen strong surges in construction and opportunities for growth there and then fuel conversion again in Massachusetts where that's been strong.","Year-on-year about 10% gross, keeping in mind we have attrition that offsets that. We're just beginning to see a slight uptick in our growth rates. Too early to tell if that's going to carry on through the balance of the year, but I'm optimistic.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Other taxes was down in both gas and electric operations. Kind of, what's driving that and what should we expect going forward?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Donald, can answer that.","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yeah. We've had some property tax appeals and true-ups this quarter that's probably a couple of pennies of the adjustments. That certainly stands out this quarter.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","What should we expect going forward?","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","I'd say, half of that is probably one-time, and some of that does go forward.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, on the transmission project, does that earn cash during construction?","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yes, it does.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, Joe, we've seen a lot of, I guess, re-ignition of the convergence scene that hit the late 1990s with a lot of these electrics buying gas companies. Kind of, what are your thoughts around consolidation?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I won't comment, Paul, on other people's deals or strategies or speculate on M&A. We're very focused on executing our plan, which, as you know, is not based on transaction but on executing \u2013 on serving our customers and our deep inventory of \u2013 and backlog of investments that we've identified \u2013 $30 billion, noting none of that has any premiums on it. So I'm very focused on execution there, continue to monitor the trends in the marketplace, but not in focus for us.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then you upped your CapEx for cash by $100 million. Is that \u2013 should we think about that as pulling some 2017 spendings forward or just an acceleration of the whole program?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I wouldn't think of it as pulling any 2017 spending forward. As you think about \u2013 and that's predominantly on the gas side of the business \u2013 as you think about the $20 billion of identified investments on the gas side, we generally have flexibility within our regulatory programs to execute on that, as conditions are favorable.","I'd noted that we had favorable weather conditions during the first half of this year, meaning the ground wasn't frozen, and we could continue working through the early part of the year. So just continuing to work through that backlog of identified investments, not specifically pulling anything forward from next year into this year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, and congrats on a solid quarter.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you. Joe, Reynolds Topeka went up quite a bit on the CapEx forecast. What drove that?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The best way to think about that, Charles, is the early estimates were very much the high level estimates, and as we came into this year, we updated with our refined detailed estimates on that project, reflected changes in design \u2013 very prudent changes in design relative to the type of construction, the tower sizes and the spans on the construction, all very consistent with other designs that we've made in other projects and have seen in the marketplace. So, really not even inflationary; just an update to the design.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","So remind me: do you have a partner on that one?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not on that one.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then, so the increase really \u2013 since it was just a very early estimate, there's no issues with the FERC recovery or anything like that, correct?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't expect any.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then when you said the 2016 represents the base going forward, even though you have this higher dividend increase in May than we anticipated, that would be the new base for dividend increases, what we're at right now for the 4% to 6%?","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yeah. That's correct. We're looking at both earnings and dividends as the base for this year.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Your line is open.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Is there anywhere that you feel that you're not earning your allowed returns or there is some lag even within the mechanisms that you have?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At any point in time, Gregg, we look at all the jurisdictions, we try to ensure that our regulatory strategy maintains pace with our investment strategy> that's a mix of base rate cases as well as the tracker programs that are up and running across electric and gas.","In general, the earnings profile ebbs and flows around 10% across the NiSource \u2013 ROE across the NiSource portfolio, and pretty close to allowed in most cases, so no significant concerns about under-earnings in a specific jurisdiction.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And are you able to confirm CapEx spending for years beyond 2016?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We are not updating previous guidance on outlook beyond 2016. We're updating 2016, again, based on strong momentum this year and an opportunity to work through favorable weather conditions. We continue to have reaffirmed the guidance of 4% to 6% EPS and dividend growth on notionally a $1.4 billion annual CapEx program.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.

This is Donald. No, at this point, we're still in great shape from balance sheet standpoint in the credit metrics; and as we reported, Fitch did upgrade us this last month or in June to BBB and stable.

Hulen - VP of IR","Analysts","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NiSource Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Randy Hulen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Randy G. Hulen","Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our NiSource quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning is Joe Hamrock, CEO; and Donald Brown, CFO.","As you know, the primary focus of today's call is to review NiSource's second quarter 2015 financial performance as well as provide an overall business update. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we will refer to supplemental slides available on our Web site.","Just a reminder, on July 1, NiSource successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group or CPG into an independent publicly traded company. As a result, NiSource no longer maintains any ownership interest in either CPG or Columbia Pipeline Partners. However, the financial information presented today does include CPG\u2019s segment results, as it was part of NiSource through June 30. I would note future NiSource financial results will report CPG as discontinued operations. Therefore, our business segment discussion today will focus solely on NiSource utilities. As an independent company, CPG is hosting its quarterly call later this morning at 10 AM Eastern.","And finally, before I turn the call over to Joe, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that some of the statements made on this call will be forward-looking. And these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","Having covered all those reminders, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this first NiSource call since the separation of CPG. Today, we\u2019ll briefly cover our second quarter results and earnings drivers before discussing execution highlights at our utilities. And we\u2019ll close with an overview of our investment proposition and our future business plan as a premier pure-play utility company. And we\u2019ll leave plenty of time for your questions.","Before we get into the details though, let me just say how excited I am about the path ahead for NiSource. We\u2019ve set a solid foundation for continued long-term growth and enhanced customer value, guided by an experienced management team with a proven record of execution. And it\u2019s a privilege to represent our team today in sharing some of the highlights of our performance as well as our outlook for the future.","As Randy noted, I\u2019ll be referencing a few slides in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning. First, a few key takeaways for the quarter. For the second quarter, results were solidly in line with our plan. The NiSource team delivered $0.18 per share non-GAAP in the recently completed quarter versus $0.25 per share in 2014. Across the board, we had continued solid execution of our infrastructure investments, customer programs and regulatory initiatives.","As Randy mentioned, we finalized the tax-free separation of CPG on July 1. After the market closed on July 1, shareholders received one share of CPG common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. Our commitments through the separation were met, including disciplined cost effective execution, our ongoing focus on customer service and our commitment to investment grade credit.","In fact, following the separation, our credit ratings at the three major agencies have either remained the same or improved. Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating to BBB plus from BBB minus. Fitch Ratings revised its outlook to BBB minus with a positive outlook from BBB minus with a stable outlook. And Moody\u2019s reaffirmed its rating of Baa2. These ratings set a strong foundation for us as a pure-play utility with significant long-term infrastructure investment opportunities.","One of the key value drivers NiSource will continue to offer investors is a solid and growing dividend, which we expect to increase by 4% to 6% annually. We announced our first post separation quarterly dividend of $0.155 per share on July 2, which is consistent with the company\u2019s intention announced in May to increase the initial combined NiSource and CPG dividend by nearly 8%.","As we also announced in May, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016 with planned infrastructure enhancement investments of approximately $1.4 billion.","Now, let me turn the call over to Donald to review our second quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides.","Donald Brown","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $57 million or $0.18 per share, which compares to about $78 million or $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was down about $7 million. As a reminder, these results include CPG reportable segment financials.","Two factors impacted our net operating earnings compared to 2014. One was additional interest expense related to Columbia Pipeline Group long-term debt issuance prior to the separation. The other was NiSource\u2019s non-controlling interest in Columbia Pipeline Partners, which was formed in February 2015. Combined, these items add up to nearly $0.06 for the quarter.","On a GAAP comparison, our loss from continuing operations was about $36 million for the second quarter versus income of about $79 million for the same period in 2014. This decrease was primarily as you would expect attributable to a loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt and separation costs.","At the segment level, each of the three pre-separation business segments delivered financial results well in line with our expectations during the second quarter. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.","Now, turning to Slide 5, I\u2019d like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile following the separation, which as you\u2019ll see is consistent with our May 14 webcast. Following the recapitalization, our total debt level was reduced to $6.7 billion with the weighted average maturity of approximately 14 years and average coupon of approximately 5.86%.","On the liquidity front, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility went into place at separation. And as of July 1, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2 billion. Our financial foundation for our continued growth as a pure-play utility is solid, on track and consistent with our commitments.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights across our utilities.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Donald. Our teams remain on track to invest approximately $1.3 billion during 2015, which is part of our $30 billion of long-term regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities. These investments further improve reliability and safety, enhanced customer service and reduced emissions, all while generating sustainable long-term growth.","Let\u2019s turn to a few highlights in our gas operations business segment on Slide 6. We\u2019re continuing our disciplined execution on core infrastructure investment and modernization programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives. In fact, just last week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts reached a settlement in principle with the Massachusetts Attorney General in its base rate case.","The settlement agreement is expected to be finalized and filed for approval with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities later this month. The case, as you\u2019ll recall, seeks to recover costs to support CMA\u2019s multiyear modernization plan to maintain the safety and reliability of natural gas service for customers.","Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case is progressing on schedule. The $46 million request supports continued investment in our well-established modernization programs that enhance safety and reliability. A decision in that case is expected by the end of this year.","Turning to the pending base rate case at Columbia Gas of Virginia, on June 30, the hearing examiner recommended specific fixed customer charges for each rate class, addressing the final outstanding issue in the case. The commission had previously found that the stipulated annual revenue increase of $25.2 million is reasonable. A final order in the case is expected later this year.","And back to Massachusetts, as an update to what we shared in our first quarter call, we received Department of Public Utilities approval of the 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan on April 30. Cost recovery began on May 1 and is projected to increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million.","And at NIPSCO gas, we continue executing on our seven-year natural gas system modernization program. Our 2015 projects, which include enhancement of existing infrastructure and extension of gas service to rural customers, are well underway and we expect to file our program and tracker update by September 1.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our electric operations on Slide 7. On May 26, NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and some of NIPSCO\u2019s largest industrial customers reached a settlement agreement resolving all concerns raised by the parties in an Indiana Court of Appeals proceeding surrounding the company\u2019s long-term Electric Infrastructure Modernization Plan. As part of the agreement, NIPSCO will file a base rate case, followed by a new seven-year plan. We expect to file the base rate case on or about October 1 of this year. ","The FGD unit under construction at NIPSCO\u2019s Michigan City Generating facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit and with those we placed in service over the past two years, all of NIPSCO\u2019s coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed. NIPSCO\u2019s two major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. You\u2019ll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.","As you can see, our teams continue to execute on a well-established infrastructure, customer and regulatory plans. Before turning to your questions, I\u2019d like to reaffirm the value proposition that we believe differentiates NiSource. Following the separation of CPG, we are well aligned with our aspiration to be a premier regulated utility company. Our plan represents a best-in-class risk adjusted total return proposition with $30 billion of long-term 100% regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities, significant scale across seven states, transparent earnings drivers and constructive regulatory environments.","We\u2019re focused on leading in the areas that matter most in our industry, those are enhancing value to our customers and community, stewarding our assets to ensure safe, reliable, affordable and efficient service, engaging and investing in the communities we serve and ensuring through disciplined execution that we deliver on our financial and other stakeholder commitments. This transparent sustainable growth is expected to drive shareholder value.","As we first announced in May, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share between $1 and $1.10 per share in 2016. We expect our capital program will grow to about $1.4 billion annually starting next year. And finally, we expect to grow our non-GAAP EPS and our dividend by 4% to 6% per year.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now, Michelle, let\u2019s open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. How are you?","Joseph Hamrock","Good morning, Paul. I\u2019m doing fine. How are you?","Paul Ridzon","Good. When do you expect Massachusetts rates to take effect? Is that calendar tolerated at all?","Joseph Hamrock","The settlement details will be filed later this month and you could look for some potential changes in the timing of the rate implementation in that settlement, but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the actual settlement itself, the filing of the settlement.","Paul Ridzon","Understood. And can you just share a little bit what\u2019s going on with electric road in Indiana, how much of that was weather? NIPSCO industrial was down. Is that all steel related?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes, we are certainly seeing the steel industry weather some very tough conditions relative to imports, and that \u2013 on the industrial side in that particular zone we\u2019re encouraged to see some sign of support from Washington related to the import issues although the recovery looks like it will be prolonged. And on the other side of the coin, we see economic development opportunities emerging, which will provide a nice boost and hopefully a modest offset to the industrial decline in our territory over time. But altogether, the key point here is our outlook factors in those conditions and the effect of that downturn and we remain confident in our guidance for 2016.","Paul Ridzon","And then maybe I\u2019m getting ahead of my skis here, but can you talk about the Indiana rate case and your strategy there with regards to rate base? Is it a \u2013 I guess filed under fair value or historic rate base?","Joseph Hamrock","We\u2019re working out the details of that filing as we speak, Paul. The key element for us is to reposition the modernization efforts allowing for the deferral of the tedious investments we\u2019ve made in '14 and '15 rolling those into that rate case and then filing a new tedious plan afterwards. And again, we\u2019ll file that case around October 1.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Joe Hamrock for any further remarks.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As you can see, NiSource is very well positioned for execution as a premier pure-play utility. Our regulatory efforts continue to play out across the stakes and we\u2019re very encouraged by the opportunities we see in the future. Until next time, I look forward to talking to you then.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. As we noted in this morning's release, the NiSource team delivered another quarter of solid execution and financial performance. On today call we'll touch on key highlights from the quarter, discuss how they position NiSource for continued growth in 2014 and beyond. Chief Financial Officer Steve Smith will review our financial results. We'll also provide updates on key execution highlights across each of our businesses, and of course we'll leave plenty of time for your questions.","So with that in mind, let's get started with some key takeaways from the quarter. You'll see these listed on slide three in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning. As I mentioned, our NiSource team once again delivered a solid quarter. Each of our business units continued to execute on our investment-driven business plan. This consistent execution has put us in a position to deliver earnings at the upper half of our non-GAAP earnings guidance of $1.61 to a $1.71 per share. Our Columbia Pipeline Group Unit continued to make steady progress on expanding inventory of growth, modernization in midstream investment opportunities. Many of these initiatives are tied closely to the company's strategic position in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions.","In our gas distribution business, Massachusetts Governor, Deval Patrick signed landmark legislation authorizing accelerated recovery of infrastructure modernization investments. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts intends to file a construction plan with the DPU by October 31st of this year and expects to begin recovering investments on May 1, 2015. ","In Indiana, our NIPSCO gas and electric business obtained regulatory approval of a $700 million natural gas modernization program, which will complement a $1.1 billion electric system modernization program. In addition to system modernization, the NIPSCO gas program provides for expansion of its gas distribution system into rural areas in Northern Indiana. ","With those quick highlights let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to take a closer look at our financial results on Page four of our supplemental slides.","Stephen P. Smith","","Thanks Bob and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned the NiSource team delivered another solid quarter and we're on track to deliver year-end earnings at the upper half of our guidance range. We generated quarterly non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $78 million or $0.25 per share, which compares to about $73 million or $0.23 per share in 2013. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $24 million when compared to the same period in 2013. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $79 million for the second quarter of 2014 versus about $72 million in 2013. ","At the segment level, you will see that each of our three core business units delivered solid financial results during the second quarter. Columbia Pipeline Group or CPG delivered operating earnings of about $104 million compared to about $89 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $22 million, primarily as a result of growth projects placed in to service and increased mineral rights royalty revenue. Operating expenses, again excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $10 million, primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs and higher depreciation.","NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $60 million in operating earnings compared to about $59 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers were up about $12 million, primarily due to higher industrial and commercial margins and increased environmental investment cost recovery. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in off-system sales. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by about $11 million, due primarily to higher electric generations cost. And finally earnings for the quarter at our gas distribution business came in at about $63 million compared with about $52 million for 2013. ","Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers, were up by nearly $26 million, primarily due to increases in regulatory and service programs. Operating expenses excluding the impact of trackers increased by about $15 million, due primarily to increased outside service costs, higher depreciation, due to an increase in capital expenditures and increased employee and administrative costs. Overall, it was another solid quarter for the NiSource team. Full details are available in our earnings release posted online this morning. ","Now turning to slide five, I'd like to quickly touch on our financing and liquidity highlights. As you can see, we retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.2 billion of net available liquidity at the end of the second quarter. I'm also pleased to reiterate that our capital program for 2014 remains on track at about $2.2 billion. As we've indicated in the past, the majority, actually more than three quarters of our investments are focused on tracked and other revenue generating opportunities. ","Looking ahead, our financial strategy continues to be balanced, straightforward and fully aligned with our robust long-term capital investment outlook. And we remain strongly committed to maintaining our investment grade credit ratings as well as sustainable earnings and dividend growth. ","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob to cover some of our business unit initiatives and execution highlights.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thanks Steve. Before opening the call to your questions, let me hit on some key execution highlights at each of our business units. Let's start with the CPG Group on slide six.","Our CPG team originated and delivered significant customer-driven growth projects in the quarter and continues to extend its already deep inventory of projects. From a growth project perspective the team began engineering and planning for the Utica access project. This $50 million project will transport Utica gas for Eclipse Resources to liquid trading points on the Columbia Gas Transmission system in West Virginia. Additionally, Columbia Transmission reached an agreement to provide firm transportation service to a natural fired gas electric generation plant in Kentucky. The roughly 70 million cubic feet per day, $25 million project is expected to begin service in mid-2016.","Meanwhile CPG\u2019s 250 million cubic feet per day Warren County project is ready for service to support WABCO\u2019s new gas fire electric plant in Virginia. CPG also continues to advance its Rayne, Leach and WB XPress projects, which we regard as been transformational in nature. The Rayne and Leach projects are in the latter stages of development and we expect to have additional details to share on these projects in a matter of weeks. As a reminder the two projects will provide additional transportation capacity of about 1.5 Bcf and 800 million cubic feet per day on the Columbia transmission and Columbia Gulf transmission systems. The projects will go into service late 2017.","On the WB XPress, this project is a bit further out, but we also expect to share additional details on this build later this quarter. This project would add another 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of transportation of Marcellus production to pipeline interconnects an east coast markets. The WB XPress project will go in to service late 2018. Columbia transmission also remains on track with the second year of its long-term system modernization program. Under the program, CPG is investing approximately $300 million annually in improvements to system reliability, integrity and flexibility. Settlement with company's customers addresses the initial five years of an expected 10 to 15 year program that will exceed $4 billion in investments.","At NiSource Midstream Services, the team has completed the facility\u2019 of its first phase of its Hickory Bend gathering and processing project. In addition our Midstream team has begun executing on the approximately $120 million Washington County gathering project announced on our first quarter call. As a reminder this project is anchored by a long-term agreement with Range Resources. This project is expected to be in service during the second half 2015. The Midstream team is also in advance discussions with customers about 175 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Big Pine Gathering System. As you can see the CPG team continues to capitalize on its solid relationships and strategic position to extend an already deep inventory of projects.","Next let's shift to our Indiana electric business summarized on slide seven. NIPSCO continues to advance a broad agenda of system modernization, reliability and environmental improvements. On the projects front NIPSCO is moving forward with its $1.1 billion electric modernization program, approved in February by the IURC. The seven year program provides for the replacement and upgrade of underground circuits, transformers and poles, helping increase system reliability and deliver economic development benefits to the region. ","Progress also continued on two major NIPSCO electric transmission projects designed to enhance region wide system flexibility and reliability. Both are on schedule and on budget. Most recently the route was selected for the Greentown-Reynolds project, a roughly 70-mile, 765 KV line being constructed jointly with Pioneer Transmission. Meanwhile the 100-mile, 345 KV Reynolds to Topeka project remains on schedule with right-of-way acquisition and permitting in process. These projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are expected to be in service by the end of 2018. ","And as we've discussed on prior calls, our NIPSCO power gen scrubber projects remain on schedule and on budget With completion dates of year end 2014 and year end 2015 these investments are part of more than $850 million of the environmental investments at NIPSCO.","Let's turn now to our gas distribution operations discussed on slide eight. Our gas distribution teams continue to steadily execute on their long term and growing inventory of infrastructure replacement and enhancement programs. We're on track to invest approximately $785 million in 2014 on system modernization and other capital improvements. And as you know we pair those investments with complementary legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as customer programs. I already mentioned the landmark legislation signed in to law in Massachusetts. This is a significant achievement which provides a mechanism that better aligns the timing of investments with recovery and paves the way for a sustained system modernization program. As I noted earlier, our CMA team will be submitting a construction plan under the new law later this year. ","On the regulatory front, we filed our first rate case in four years of Columbia Gas of Virginia. The case is seeking a revenue increase of approximately $25 million which would support CGV's ongoing efforts to accommodate growth as well as cost recovery of CGV's multi-year distribution system modernization program. A decision is expected by the end of the year. Meanwhile the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's rate case remains on track. That's a $54 million request which would support continuation of CPA's ongoing modernization program. We expect a resolution later this year.","As you can see, our gas distribution companies continue to steadily execute on a well-established agenda of long-term investment in system reliability and customer programs. To wrap up, given the team\u2019s strong execution of the plan we're now positioned to achieve results at the upper half of our 2014 non-GAAP guidance range of $1.61 to a $1.71 per share. I also want to reiterate that our team continues to execute against NiSource\u2019s robust investment driven business strategy and we're doing so while staying true to our well established core commitments. Those are maintaining stable, investment grade credit ratings, delivering stable and long-term dividend growth, delivering stable and long-term earnings growth.","And last but not least, as Randy mentioned in his introduction we're hosting an Investor day on Monday, September 29th. Consistent with our past sessions our team will be providing a detailed discussion of the NiSource investment proposition, supported by an in-depth review of our growth opportunities and investment inventories across each of our business units. We're looking forward to that meeting and your participation. Again thank you for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. Grant, we can now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Please standby for your first question. And our first question is coming from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Good morning.","Robert C. Skaggs","Hey, good morning Paul. How are you?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Good, good. Congratulations on another solid quarter.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thank you. Well it was a nice quarter. I appreciate it.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Can we put bookmarks around the potential capital for Leach and Rayne?","Robert C. Skaggs"," ","Paul, I ask you to bear with me. In just a matter of weeks, a mere matter of weeks, we're going to give you a lot of detail around both of those projects and there'll be a heck of a lot more than bookmarks.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Sounds good. And then how should we think about the dividend going forward just growing with earnings?","Robert C. Skaggs","Continue to grow on a robust basis. We'll give you more of a sense at Investor Day about the way we think about it. But as you know, we're balancing a very, very strong investment program, strong earnings growth rate and a strong dividend. So again I ask you to bear with me a little bit more color commentary when we see in the -- in to September.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","And given the pretty impressive backlog of projects could we look for you to revisit your growth rate in September?","Robert C. Skaggs","We'll talk about that in September, Paul again, we're going to cover the waterfront, certainly earnings growth will be one of the key topics among many, that we'll touch on.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","September can't get here soon enough, I guess. So I\u2019m looking forward to it. Thank you guys.","Robert C. Skaggs","Thank you. Thanks, Paul.","Stephen P. Smith ","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you for your question there. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please proceed.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc.","Good morning.","Robert C. Skaggs","Hi Charles.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc.","","Massachusetts, can you just over what was the key differences in the existing prior program and under the new legislation and I guess the follow-up already would be is $25 million to $50 million that you are showing on, actually what slide 16 of annualized investment, can we anticipate that to go up or would that -- will the new legislation just put that in the upper range?","Robert C. Skaggs","Yeah, let me start with the question about then and now. The Massachusetts regulatory approach was a more traditional regulatory approach. We file periodically rate cases and because of that convention there tended to be a significant lag, much greater than 12 months on CapEx investments. So again a traditional rate case sort of mode that we follow and all the other utilities follow to Massachusetts. What the new legislation would provide for you to file an annual construction plan for your modernization activities. We intend to file that plan by the end of October. The DPU has six months to consider the plan and then you begin rate recovery on investments beginning in the spring of 2015.","So the lag is effectively eliminated. You'll be recovering on your investments as you make those investments during the period. So that's how the mechanism will work versus how it worked traditionally. Give or take we\u2019re spinning annually about $40 million in Massachusetts on modernization, ongoing maintenance and the like. Under the new program, again we're developing our plan. We'll file it at the end of October. We anticipate our spending will pick up but we've been spending at a very good clip in Massachusetts up to this point. ","By the way I would add that there is a cap in the legislation on how large the programs can be and I\u2019ll have Randy check this, but I believe it's 1.5% of your firm annual revenues, is how the program is capped.","Charles J.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Randy Hulen. Sir, you may begin.","Randy G. Hulen - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning. On behalf of everyone at NiSource, I'd like welcome you to our quarterly analyst call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Brown, Chief Financial Officer.","The purpose of today's call is to review the NiSource financial performance for the first quarter of 2016, as well as provide an overall business update on our utility operations and growth drivers. We'll then open up the call to your questions. Just as a reminder, we will be referring to supplemental earnings slides that are available on our website.","Before turning the call over to Joe, just a quick reminder that some statements made on this conference call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings.","With all that covered, I'd like to now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we'll detail on today's call, NiSource is off to a great start in 2016. Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our regulated business strategy and sustained track record of delivering improved service for our customers through our utility investment programs.","We continue to execute on our infrastructure investment strategy, which is designed to improve safety, reliability and environmental performance for our customers and communities. NiSource also made significant progress on several regulatory initiatives supporting these investments, as well as enhanced employee training and customer programs.","Today, we'll briefly cover our first quarter 2016 results before discussing specific operational and regulatory highlights. We'll also touch on how we're positioning NiSource for continued growth before opening the call for your questions.","Turning to slide three of our supplemental deck, let's now highlight a few key takeaways for the quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.60 per share in the first quarter compared to $0.57 in the same period in 2015. We are well positioned to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings within our 2016 guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share. And with a strong start to the construction season, we're on track to execute on more than $1.4 billion in utility infrastructure investments planned for the year.","Violet Sistovaris and our NIPSCO team reached settlement agreements with key stakeholders in both its electric base rate case, and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. And our Columbia Gas teams led by Carl Levander filed base rate cases in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. And we received regulatory approval of gas system modernization plan updates in Indiana, Massachusetts and Ohio.","On the organizational front, we announced changes aimed at further advancing our growth plan and enhancing performance. Pablo Vegas joined NiSource today as President of our Columbia Gas group. He will oversee the six Columbia Gas companies, including leadership of state regulatory, customer, and stakeholder performance, as well as customer service, billing and new business platforms for all seven NiSource companies.","Pablo most recently served as President and Chief Operating Officer of AEP Ohio. With Pablo's appointment and the planned retirement of our Human Resources Leader, Rob Campbell, Chief Regulatory Officer, Carl Levander, assumes the role of Executive Vice President, Regulatory Policy and Corporate Affairs, which includes responsibility for Policy, Corporate Communications, Federal Government Affairs, Regulatory Strategy and Human Resources at NiSource.","I'll talk more about the significant progress across all our businesses later in the call, but first I'd like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on page four of our supplemental slides. Donald?","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Thanks, Joe. And good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $191 million or $0.60 per share in the quarter compared with about $179 million or $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2015.","On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $399 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $35 million over the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $180 million for the quarter versus about $193 million in the first quarter of 2015.","Now, let's take a closer look at the operating earnings performance of our two utility business segments for the first quarter of 2016. Our gas distribution operation segment delivered about $330 million compared with about $306 million in 2015.","Net revenues excluding the impact of trackers were up by nearly $35 million, primarily attributable to increases in regulatory and service program, including the impact of new rates in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, as well as the implementation of new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's approved infrastructure replacement program.","Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by $10.3 million, primarily due to increased outside service costs and higher depreciation. Our electric operations reported about $72 million compared with about $67 million for 2015. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were essentially flat.","Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by $4.8 million, primarily due to lower generation expenses, decreased employee and administrative costs and lower environmental expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher outside service costs.","As Joe mentioned, our first quarter results positioned NiSource well to deliver net operating earnings within our guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share for the year. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.","Now turning to slide five, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.72%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.","On March 31, we executed a three-year, $500 million term loan agreement with pricing of LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In utilizing the delayed draw feature, we have until the end of September to borrow the full $500 million. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of more than $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities.","And our credit ratings at the three major agencies remain solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. Going forward, our financial foundation is strong employees for continued execution and growth.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Donald. We began 2016 by building upon the positive momentum that we've gained in recent years in maintaining our sharp focus on serving our customers and communities.","For instance, in March, we became a founding member of the U.S. EPA's Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program. Through our five-year program commitment, NiSource will continue to replace cast iron and bare steel pipelines remaining in our natural gas system. Since 2005, we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 23%. As part of our planned investments, we expect to further reduce methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet, a reduction of 10% compared to 2015.","In addition to helping reduce emissions, our well-established infrastructure modernization programs are producing other meaningful benefits and adding value for our customers. For example, we have reduced gas leaks on our mains by 9%, and by 14% on our service lines over the past five years. This builds on the safety and reliability of our system.","And we have continued to receive recognition for doing business the right way. In March, NiSource was named for the fifth consecutive year as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute. Ethisphere honors companies for leading and promoting ethical business standards in key categories, which include ethics and compliance programs. This designation demonstrates our commitment to serving our customers with integrity and the highest of ethical business standards.","Now, let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on slide six. On March 18, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to adjust its base rates in support of the company's continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure, and other programs to enhance pipeline safety.","If approved as filed, the case would result in $55 million annual revenue increase. An order is expected by the end of 2016. On April 20, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacement rider. The rider provides for continued support of the company's well-established pipeline replacement program investments. This order authorizes an increase of about $21 million in annual revenue related to 2015 infrastructure investments of about $185 million.","At NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its seven-year, approximately $800 million long-term gas system modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. On March 30th, the Indiana utility regulatory commission or IURC approved the semi-annual tracker update that was filed in August 2015 with additional revenues of $7.6 million, which covered approximately $74 million of investments through mid-2015.","NIPSCO filed its latest semi-annual tracker update on February 29th, which remains pending with the IURC. On April 29, Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability of its distribution system and to accommodate increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected by early 2017.","A decision on Columbia Gas of Massachusetts' 2016 Gas System Enhancement Plan was issued by the Massachusetts' Department of Public Utilities on April 29th. This approval allows for a recovery of investments through 2016 and will increase annual revenues by approximately $8.2 million beginning May 1st.","On April 15th, Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates so it can support the continued replacement of aging pipe, as well as adopt pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6.5 million. A commission order is expected by the end of 2016. And finally, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, on April 27th, filed notice with the Kentucky Public Service Commission that it intends to file a request to adjust its base rates to support continued infrastructure investments.","Now, let's turn to our electric operations on slide seven. On March 24th, NIPSCO reached a settlement agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, industrial customers, the La Porte County Board of Commissioners and the Indiana Municipal Utility Group on the company's seven-year electric infrastructure modernization plan.","This plan includes more than $1.2 billion of transmission and distribution investments designed to improve system safety and reliability. An IURC order on the settlement is anticipated in the third quarter of 2016.","NIPSCO also reached an agreement in its electric base rate case currently pending before the IURC. The February 19 settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments in service improvements for customers. The proposed settlement agreement would increase annual revenues by $72.5 million. An IURC order is anticipated early in the third quarter of 2016.","NIPSCO's two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345KV and 65-mile 765KV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway on both projects. NIPSCO expects to provide updated project cost estimates prior to the commencement of line construction later this year.","Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to touch on our financial and growth commitments as well as how we're positioning NiSource for continued growth. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014.","As we've outlined previously, we expect to deliver net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10, and to make more than $1.4 billion in planned infrastructure investments in 2016. This 2016 earnings and investment guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4 to 6%, which we first announced a year ago in anticipation of the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group.","As we execute on our well established plans, we're aligning our organization to capitalize on all of our strategic opportunities, including our infrastructure investment plans, while at the same time looking at enhancements to our plan such as growing our customer base, improving service to our customers and driving enhanced performance through the increased use of common platforms. These emerging elements of our plan are expected to enhance our existing best-in-class risk-adjusted total return proposition.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.","Now let's open the call to your questions. Skyler?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Happy to finally be covering the stock.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Welcome to the fold.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","I wish I had been quicker on the uptake and got all the outperformance the last couple of years, but so be it. So I've asked you this question before and I just wanted to ask it again. Obviously, the performance in the quarter was great and you've got $1.4 billion in capital still in the budget \u2013 vast majority of it covered by riders. And you've got this sort of 4% to 6% long-term earnings guidance drive out there, but the rate base growth guidance range is 6% to 8%. Obviously, that's very enticing because there seems like there's a lot of cushion in there. But you first gave that well before the bonus depreciation rules were extended for five years, so can you tell us about how that may have moved things around inside the guidance range? It still seems like you're well positioned to, at the minimum, hit the high end of the earnings guidance range. But maybe the rate base growth is less robust because of bonus d and what you might do to offset that?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Greg. And it's a fairly common question, as you noted. I'll ask Donald to touch on the bonus and the relative impact on rate base and how we're navigating through that. But let me take this, sort of, the higher level question about the relationship between our outlook, our guidance and our business plan.","We think and firmly believe that one of the strengths of the NiSource story is the long-term visibility, the sustained investment platform we have that we outlined as we noted a couple of years ago with the $30 billion in investment.","As we look through the future and the strong support we have across all seven states for those kind of investments, that's a great engine for driving growth, the visibility. And I wanted to be sure that we've put out a fairly long-term look at earnings guidance in that 4% to 6% annual growth range. We remain committed to that.","As we've noted before, the relationship between investments and rate base that are tracked, the ongoing support for those investments, is offset in some ways and a couple of ways by regulatory lag, continued O&M growth that gets picked up in rate cases that don't have quite the same effect as the trackers have. A bit of conservatism in our outlook. And then over the long-term, the need to finance that in a balanced way. That story remains the same today.","I will ask Donald to touch on the effect of bonus. As we've noted, our guidance remains the same for the year, and our growth guidance remains the same. A little bit of insight about the relationship of bonus depreciation would be helpful.","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yeah. And so think about the bonus depreciation on our rate base. It certainly has a detrimental impact over our plan years, and we typically look out four to five years. And so what we've done to offset that is to increase our capital spend a little bit over the next couple of years to offset the impact of the rate base.","But then when you look at it over a four- or five-year period, we actually do have positive cash flows through the period. If you'll remember, we've got NOLs that before this extension of bonus depreciation went out through 2018. With this extension of bonus depreciation, our NOL will now go out to the end of 2022.","So from a cash standpoint is the detriment early with the bonus depreciation because of the NOL position. But on the back end of the years, we do have a cash pickup. And so with the cash, we'll spend in the next couple of years to offset the rate base degradation, we'll come out slightly ahead over kind of a five- or six-year period.","So I think all in all, we're looking at staying within that range. It doesn't challenge our earnings growth story. And at the same time, I think as Joe talked a little bit about conservatism, we understand we're in multiple rate cases at any time. There's certainly some risk from amount realized, as well as just the timing of when rates go into effect. And so trying to balance out the understanding of the risks of both the kind of regulatory mechanisms, as well as kind of O&M, which doesn't go into the trackers. We feel confident we'll certainly be in the range, but obviously have some opportunities, if everything goes the right way to be at the higher end of the range.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Fantastic. Thanks, guys. Take care.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Liou from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to walk through the decision process on the term loan. Was it more economically driven or was it more so of a flexibility decision when it comes to kind of call provisions on term loans?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say it's both. When we're looking at the need for this year and looking at what are our different options, really did want to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and the interest savings that provided, as well as making sure we've got kind of a full toolkit for financing our company going forward. So I'd say it's a little bit of both. And I think, going forward, we'll look at both the bond market, as well as taking advantage of the bank market in term loans.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan","Got you. And can you just remind us what are your financing needs? I know I think you paid down the rest of your 10% handle that remained outstanding.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So this year I would expect that we wouldn't have any significant financing needs. This term loan, which we took out. We haven't actually tapped into yet and won't tap into until later this year. But I don't expect anything significant this year. But certainly, we're always looking at our portfolio. We do have some higher cost debt in the portfolio and still looking for opportunities to bring down our overall cost of debt. If the market and the timing makes sense, we would do that as well.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","Thank you. Just to follow up on that bonus depreciation question. I noticed, Joe, in your introductory comments, I believe you said CapEx for 2016 more than $1.4 billion, where I believe last quarter it was approximately $1.4 billion. Is that consistent with Donald's comments about the accelerating CapEx because of the cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Charles, and good morning. That's very perceptive. It's entirely consistent. There's not a big shift in the 2016 \u2013 Donald's comments related to the near-term years of the plan to offset the NOL issues and to help with the outer years of the plan on an earnings standpoint. But it's all around the $1.4 billion, as we've navigated through the 2016 planning cycle.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","Okay. And then my next question is on the case or the settlement on the electric modernization program. Does that \u2013 are we done? Does that pretty much eliminate any of the excitement that we've seen \u2013 regulatory and legal? I mean, are you pretty confident we're on the...","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're confident that \u2013 yes, I'm sorry. I like your term excitement. But we're confident that we've got a framework vis-\u00e0-vis the settlement that we've filed. We are still in the regulatory process. So we still have the remaining steps through the regulatory process that we would expect to resolve early in the third quarter this year, but feel very good about the position we're in and we've remained committed to making those investments. So that's all part of the framework that we've set up.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","Okay, thank you. That was all I had.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Charles. Have a great day.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on another solid quarter.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Paul. Thank you.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just with bonus depreciation, what's your current view on when you may need to come back for some equity?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't see any real shift at this point in our outlook relative to bonus. We continue to not see a need for equity in the near term of the plan. And as you would guess with bonus, that didn't change at all. We continue to look at our total plan, including CapEx, dividend policy and the ultimate need for equity. But at this point, not ready to change our outlook on any of those factors.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then strategically, it seems like a lot of large cap electrics kind of want to get some gas exposure. How are you thinking about the opportunity there?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we remain committed to our plan. As we've watched that play out, we look at our plan and don't really need M&A to drive our opportunities going forward. Very focused on. As we've talked about at length today, the capital investments and the regulatory cadence that we've set up in our plan, and certainly don't see M&A as a part of that strategy. That said, with anything that would be compelling being introduced into the mix, we'd certainly take a look at that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Certainly you don't need the growth opportunity, but maybe there's some players out there who could use your opportunities.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sure that's fine.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, guys, I had a follow-up question. It's on a completely different subject. I'm looking at the NEXUS pipeline project that's being jointly built by Spectra and DTE.","And in their first quarter slide deck, slide 25, they show the path of that pipeline going through your service territory in Ohio and sort of a massive amount of interest \u2013 interconnect agreements of up to 1.75 Bcf a day. And some of the names of your gas utilities are very prominent on that list. Can you talk about your needs for incremental gas supply and how likely it is that you'd be taking gas off the NEXUS pipeline and in what amounts?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Greg, that's something we keep an eye on but not something that we're actively interested in and involved in at this point, and a good position on capacity in the Midwest. More of our focus these days is in New England and Massachusetts. As you know, we have a position in the Northeast Direct Pipeline project. So a lot of focus there on how to ensure that we have what we need up there. We, though, will continue to keep an eye on the Midwest. And if we see an opportunity, we'll certainly participate.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So you're definitely interested in capacity on the pipes going into New England. And this is more of a wait-and-see situation?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, a more \u2013 that's a good way to characterize it. Again, if we see an opportunity there that makes sense, we'll certainly take advantage of that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And what's the timeline that you would normally, seriously consider a formal interconnect agreement on a new pipe? You would wait for that pipe to be sort of firmly under construction before you would have a serious conversation with them? I'm not that familiar with the process there.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, typically there's an open season upfront. We participate in that, express interest. That usually precedes any actual construction. So we'd be ahead of that curve to help underpin the fundamentals for the project itself. But that's not always the case. Sometimes there's opportunistic second pass, third pass opportunities to take advantage of a new project. So it really varies depending on our supply\/demand balance, our existing contracts and the growth opportunities in that region. So I don't think there's a precise recipe that applies in all cases.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Well, yeah, this would be a second or third pass-type deal because they did their open season, they're 65%, 66% contracted, 50% with LDCs up a bit top end of the pipe, the other 50% of that is producers. And then they've been talking about the potential for incremental interconnect agreements along the length of the pipe. So am I right to say that that would be a second or third pass-type of deal?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I want to be careful that my general comment there is not characterizing a specific project or specific interest. This is an area we continue to look at. But on that specific project, I'm not providing any specific outlook on our participation at this point.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thanks.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Can't hurt to try. Thank you.

For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment and financial information available on nisource.com.","In that document, you'll also find our full financial schedules that have historically been available in our earnings release. ","With all that out of the way, the call is now yours, Joe.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. During the second quarter, the NiSource team built on the strong foundation established at the start of 2017 and continued to drive value for our customers and investors by executing on our infrastructure investments, regulatory initiatives and customer programs. And on the financial front, successfully refinancing debt to capture interest expense savings opportunities.","Let's look at Slide 3 of our supplemental deck and highlight our financial position and some of our significant achievements so far this year. We delivered second quarter net operating earnings per share non-GAAP of $0.10 compared to $0.08 during the same period in 2016. We remain on track to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utility infrastructure this year with more than $820 million invested through the second quarter. These program investments are part of our more than $30 billion of identified long term investment opportunities. And we refinanced about $1 billion in debt during the quarter which will drive interest expense savings over the next several years.","As we announced in this morning's press release, the team's effective execution and the strong financial results in the first half of the year combined with the successful outcome of our financing activities have led us to increase our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share. Taking into account this increased 2017 guidance range, we continue to expect, as we shared with you at our Investor Day in March, to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividend by 5% to 7% each year through 2020.","We're also continuing to execute on our investment and regulatory programs. In Indiana, we reached a settlement agreement related to the CCR environmental upgrades we've proposed for certain generating stations and we received approval of the latest semi-annual tracker update associated with our gas modernization program. We also filed our second electric modernization tracker update request and our electric transmission projects remain on track to be in service in the second half of 2018. ","In Ohio, we're working with stakeholders on our application for a 5-year extension of our long term gas Infrastructure Replacement Program and we've reached a settlement in our base rate case in Maryland. On the customer growth front, we're slightly ahead of our plan.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail. Donald?","Donald Brown","Thanks Joe and good morning, everyone. As Joe noted earlier, our results for the first half of 2017 were quite strong and we have raised our 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance range to $1.17 to $1.20 per share.","Now turning to Slide 4. We delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $33 million or $0.10 per share in the second quarter compared with about $27 million or $0.08 per share for the same period in 2016. Through the first half of 2017, our net operating earnings are up about $40 million or $0.11 per share compared with the same period in 2016.","The biggest driver of our solid financial performance continues to be the impact of our long term infrastructure modernization investments supported by solid regulatory outcome and established infrastructure trackers. I would add that we've built additional momentum during the quarter by successfully refinancing about $1 billion of near term maturity debt with lower rate debt, accelerating interest expense savings over the next several years. ","In addition to our refinancing activities, we issued another $1 billion in new debt which we'll use to finance investments in our infrastructure modernization programs.","During our first quarter update, we noted that we had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an at-the-market or ATM, equity issuance program. During the quarter, we issued about 1.3 million shares, receiving proceeds of nearly $34 million. As outlined at Investor Day, the ATM, combined with debt offerings and our well-established dividend reinvestment program, is intended to provide a balanced financing approach for NiSource's capital investments. And all financing costs, including equity dilution, are included in our 2017 earnings guidance and our growth rate commitments through 2020.","Let's turn now to our segment level results. Our Gas Distribution Operations segment delivered operating earnings of about $56 million in the quarter, a decrease of about $18 million compared with the same period in 2016. Net revenues were up about $22 million, driven primarily by new rates from base rate cases and Infrastructure Replacement Programs. This increased revenue was offset by an approximately $40 million increase in operating expenses related to higher employee and administrative costs, increased outside service cost, depletion expenses -- depreciation expenses, property taxes and environmental costs.","Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $84 million in the quarter, an increase of about $20 million from the second quarter of 2016.","Net revenues were up about $42 million, driven by new rates from the base rate case, increased investment in the transmission projects and increased industrial and commercial usage. This increased electric revenue was partially offset by higher operating expenses of approximately $22 million, primarily due to increased generation-related maintenance and vegetation management costs; increased employee administrative costs and higher growth receipts taxes.","Before moving on from our results, I'd like to add a little context around the increase in non-tracked O&M expenses. In the gas segment, we've made commitments in recent rate case settlements to make certain investments in safety, reliability and customer service enhancements. In our electric business, we've increased the plant maintenance and vegetation management activities to boost our reliability. We're managing these expenses closely and as we shared at Investor Day, we remain confident that our performance transformation process will lead to a flattening of O&M expenses after 2017.","Full details of our second quarter results are available in our earnings release and supplemental financial information posted this morning at nisource.com.","Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our debit and credit -- debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $8.2 billion, of which, about $7.3 billion was a long term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long term debt was approximately 16 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.9%. I would note that we've made significant progress to reduce our weighted average interest rate by nearly 100 basis points since separation. This reduced cost of capital will help provide long term sustainability to our infrastructure investment programs.","At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility. It's worth mentioning again that our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at BAA2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlooks.","Going forward, our financial foundation is solid and poised for continued growth.","Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.","Joseph Hamrock","Thanks, Donald. Before getting into those details, I'd like to highlight 2 milestones which connect with our stakeholder commitment of being recognized by all in our communities as the best place to work. First, in May, NiSource was included in Forbes magazine's list of America's Best Large Employers for 2017. We ranked 61st overall, a significant jump from last year's rankings and I'm proud to say that we were the top-rated utility company. Recognition like this reinforces and helps spread the word that our 8,000 employees are creating a great place to work, grow and build a career.","And in June, I joined more than 150 CEOs of some of the world's leading companies to sign the CEO Action For Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. It was an easy decision to sign this pledge because at NiSource, we're committed to building and maintaining an inclusive culture in a diverse workforce. Our teams understand that diversity is important in order for us to deliver on the expectations of our customers. So we're proud to join with other leading organizations to affirm our commitment to diversity and inclusion.","We believe that if we provide our employees the right training and development opportunities and the right tools and technology, they will better serve our customers and communities. A great example of that is our continued modernization of our training program for our field operations employees.","In May, we opened the second of 4 new state-of-the-art field employee training centers in suburban Columbus. Our first center opened near Pittsburgh last summer and another is expected to open later this year in Virginia. Construction has also begun on a facility in Massachusetts that will open in 2018.","Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the second quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across all states and to advance key regulatory initiatives, all while growing our customer base. As I mentioned earlier, in Indiana, we received approval of our latest semi-annual tracker update covering approximately $61 million of investments that were made in the second half of 2016 which is part of a 7-year $845 million program to further improve system reliability and safety. In Ohio, our application for a 5-year extension of our Infrastructure Replacement Program remains pending before the Public Utilities Commission. Discussions with stakeholders continue following the PUCO staff's recommended approval with modifications last month. This well-established program authorized through the end of 2017 covers accelerated replacement of priority mainline pipe and immediate replacement of targeted customer service lines. A PUCO order in the new filing is expected by the end of the year. ","On the rate case front, last week, we reached a settlement with all parties to our request in Maryland. The case supports expedited replacement of aging pipe and adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades. If approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission, the settlement would result in an annual revenue increase of $2.4 million effective in late October.","In May, new rates took effect with tracker updates in our Ohio Infrastructure Replacement Program and our Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan which combined, include more than $300 million of investments. ","Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania continues to execute on its robust modernization program as well with plans on track to invest more than $200 million in 2017. ","Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. In June, NIPSCO, along with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Citizens Action Coalition and a group of NIPSCO industrial customers submitted a settlement agreement seeking, among other things, approval and cost recovery for investments related to limiting coal ash emissions from certain units at our Michigan City and Schahfer generating stations. The settlement also calls for moving additional investments designed to reduce these units' impact on local waterways to a later proceeding. An IURC order on the CCR settlement is expected before the end of this year.","We continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program which includes enhancements to electric transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to improve system safety and reliability. Approximately $1.25 billion of investments are planned through 2022. We filed our second semi-annual tracker update request in June, covering about $134 million in investments made from May 2016 through April 2017.","Our two major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 kV and 65-mile 765 kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide flexibility and reliability. Substation line and tower construction are well underway for both projects.","On the electric customer service front, I'm happy to report that last month, NIPSCO was recognized by J.D. Power as one of the most improved brands in the nation with a 59-point or 9%, improvement in its score. This strong performance helps demonstrate that our electric modernization program is benefiting customers and that our Indiana team, like all our teams, is focused on delivering the value our customers expect. ","As we wrap up today, just some key takeaways before opening the call to your questions. NiSource's long term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to create value for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance for our shareholders. Our successful refinancing efforts will result in interest expense savings and our recent debt and equity issuances have generated low-cost capital to invest in our high-value modernization programs. We now expect to deliver 2017 non-GAAP net operating earnings in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share and we remain on track to complete $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital investments this year, continuing to execute our more than $30 billion in identified long term investment opportunities.","With our robust investment plans and taking into account our increased earnings guidance range, we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2020, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings.","So thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.","Now let's open the call to your questions. Sonya?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","Glad you've continued to break out kind of the growth you're seeing from the customer growth initiatives. Can you just give some -- an update on that and kind of the trajectory there? And then secondly, just some more detail around the employee costs. Particularly, the net gas segment were up pretty high. Is that a timing issue or should we think about that as a new run rate?","Joseph Hamrock","Sure, Paul. Thanks. Both insightful questions. Let me touch on the growth update first. As we laid out at our investment -- Investor Day back in March, we have plans in place and expect to reach a run rate of 1% annual growth in customer additions by 2020. And this year is a pretty significant step for us in building and implementing capabilities to market those opportunities differently, to build the policy arena, to support that and to build the capabilities to execute. And we're ahead of plan through the second quarter in terms of the additions we've seen and feel very confident that our progress toward that ultimate goal of 1% sustained run rate is well on hand and well in sight for us. So I'd say encouragement confidence continues to grow. No significant change in our outlook for how these capabilities will ultimately fill in on the plan for us, but very good results so far. On the O&M side, I would say we're on plan through the second quarter and that's important to note.","The mix of factors drive that year-on-year change that you see led by the things Donald touched on earlier in the call, the commitments to safety, reliability and training that we made in the last round of rate cases. And on top of that, transformation initiatives that we've been talking about that have some front-end investment required in customer service, in value-creating initiatives and then ultimately also growing our capabilities to execute at the new higher capital investment levels you're seeing this year. Ultimately, all of that we expect to level off after 2017. So not so much timing issues within the year as it is about the build of capabilities and execution driven by all of those factors so far this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Turnure of JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure","Can you just give us an update on the potential need for equity, both internal plans and the ATM program this year going forward. As well how we can think about your need there, given the fact that guidance is now higher for 2017 and you've done the big refi, you've had some regulatory success year-to-date, et cetera?","Donald Brown","Chris, this is Donald. I'll take that question. From an equity standpoint, we're still on plan with what we talked about and discussed at our Analyst Day of $200 million to $300 million a year. We think that it will be a consistent plan through 2020 of equity from ATM in that amount as well as $50 million to $60 million from the DRIP program. So no changes yet. I think our goal really is to have a stable predictable financing program. And again, all of that is included in our guidance for this year as well as through 2020.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And then do you know what your earned ROE is on, let's say, a trailing 12-month basis or the earned ROE that you plan for underneath your updated guidance for the full year 2017 on a kind of consolidated basis at the utility level? Also, kind of earned ROE, excluding any kind of corporate impact?","Donald Brown","I'd say when you think about it from -- we've tend to look at each individual state as well as the overall returns. And each of our states, think about last year coming through 4 base rate cases. We're pretty close to our allowed ROE from -- in each of those cases, but we'll continue to monitor returns and determine when is the best time to go back in for base rate cases.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. So if we're kind of sitting here today looking forward coming out of a bunch of regulatory activity, there's no particular jurisdiction that's underperforming versus your expectations?","Donald Brown","No, not at all.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar.","Charles Fishman","Just to make sure I understand this correctly on Slide 3. The -- I understand your operating earnings per share increased in your guidance and that the new base will now be 2017 guidance. But the dividend, am I reading this correctly? The -- that really doesn't change. Your 5% to 7% growth off the, what, $0.70 dividend we have for this year and that's still the guidance for dividend growth, correct?","Donald Brown","Yes. Consistently have laid out a plan for 5% to 7% growth in net operating earnings per share and dividend and that's guided predominantly by our policy of 60% to 70% payout on the EPS -- off of the EPS guidance.","Charles Fishman","Okay. If memory serves me, actually, the dividend increase this year was actually above that range, but that's not -- - I shouldn't read anything into that.","Donald Brown","Yes. I mean, think about it this way, the earnings in dividend commitment is 5% to 7%. If we were to outperform that range like we have in the past, we would also set the dividend so it's in the 60% to 70% payout range.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Second question on the Ohio infrastructure replacement extension. Is anything changing on that? I mean, are we -- are you increasing the projected amounts or?","Donald Brown","Yes. Charles, thanks for that question. The key change, if you will or update in the 5-year plan that we put in front of the commission and stakeholders is an increase in the level of investment and acceleration from the plan that we're in right now. So the current plan, this is year 5 of the 5-year plan, runs at a -- little over $1 billion across the 5 years. The proposal we put in front of stakeholders escalates that to about $1.3 billion, but it's the same mix of investments, the same program, the same risk profile that drives the recommended investments.","Charles Fishman","And how's the ROE set on that tracker?","Donald Brown","That's look back at the last rate case.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Easy question for you, what has to happen for you to hit the high end of your multiyear EPS guidance range or even to be in a position to raise that range a bit?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. As we've looked at our plan and how much it's driven by the investment programs that are here and the regulatory cadence, probably the most significant driver of any variation would be the mix of regulatory outcomes. We tend to be a portfolio of regulatory initiatives in any given year, so there's a range of potential outcomes that you might anticipate in this year. Last year was a peak on the base rate case cycle. This year is a little bit lower level of activity. That's the key driver. Behind that, you could have a load and O&M savings or O&M profile spending, but those are pretty stable, relative to the regulatory drivers in our plan.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And when we think about 2018 O&M as a growth rate relative to what you're kind of booking in 2017, how -- we're still talking 2018 is higher than 2017. It's just at a more inflationary type of rate versus the big uptick in '17? Or is there a scenario where 2018 and '19 are even down from '17?","Donald Brown","I think the way to think about it at this point is really a flat off of 2017 through the rest of the plan. We made, as Joe mentioned earlier, we started our transformation efforts last year in building the program and started making investments this year that really will drive efficiency and higher performance for the company. And expect that after 2017, our expenses really will be more, I'd say, flat versus inflationary at a inflation level.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Gregg Orrill of Barclays.","Gregg Orrill","It looks like a couple of the transmission projects that you're working on, you expect to complete them in '18. Is there anything -- does that mean that we should sort of conclude that, that would drive you toward the lower part of the CapEx range that you're looking for, for '19 and '20? Or are there other things that would replace that?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes. Thank you, Greg. Thanks for the -- well, the transmission projects are -- are we still live? Well, the transmission projects are expected to be completed next year. Our mix of investments does shift throughout the 2020 planning horizon and I'd note that the CCR settlement that we filed, we ramp into that spending beginning yet this year and then you'd see some of that come on. So that mix is different over time. But generally, all expected to be in that $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion range that we set out on our Investor Day pro forma through 2020.","Gregg Orrill","Can you talk a little bit more about the details of the CCR settlement?","Joseph Hamrock","Yes, sure. That is a retrofit to the units that we proposed continuing to run for compliance with the CCR rules, the coal ash rules. It's $193 million proposal supported -- that's not to exceed number in the settlement, supported by stakeholders for retrofits at both Schahfer and Michigan City. Fairly tried-and-true technology and high confidence in the efficacy of those investments. And the other small piece of that settlement is some of the front-end engineering and design for the Water Rule, just a few million dollars set up in that settlement to allow us to continue evaluating technologies for compliance with the ELG provisions as well. That would be deferred until a future rate case. But on the CCR side, it follows the federally mandated cost adjustment statute in Indiana which is an 80-20, 80% recovered, 20% deferred, much like our Titus program.","Gregg Orrill","And that would be the 9.75% ROE?","Joseph Hamrock","That's correct.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo","I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but what specifically drove the $0.04 increase in the midpoint of your guidance?","Joseph Hamrock","Sure. Let me let Donald talk through some of the moving pieces in that.","Donald Brown","Yes. I think if you remember from our first quarter call, we did raise our guidance of -- our initial guidance for the year was $1.12 to $1.18. At the first quarter, we did narrow that guidance to the upper half of that range. And the only change that's really happened in the second quarter is the refinancing of the $1 billion which provides about $0.02 incremental earnings through interest savings. And so we did raise our guidance $1.17 to $1.20 to account for that savings.","Brian Russo","Okay, understood. So you exceeded your expectations on the refinancing and...","Donald Brown","Well, I guess, the way I'd answer is the -- in our initial guidance, the refinancing was not contemplated. So it was not part of our original plan.","Brian Russo","Okay, understood. So the new base is 2017. So in theory, the earnings outlook has increased by whatever, the $0.04 versus the prior guidance?","Donald Brown","That's correct.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Zhou of Avon Capital.","Joseph Hamrock","Joe, we can't hear you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock for any further remarks.","Joseph Hamrock","Thank you, Sonya and thanks again to all of you for joining us and your continued interest in and support of NiSource. Knowing it's a busy morning here in the market, turn the day back over to you, make it a great and safe day. Thanks for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Randy Hulen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Randy G. Hulen - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kat, and good morning, everybody. On behalf of NiSource, welcome to our quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning are Joe Hamrock, our Chief Executive Officer, and Donald Brown, our Chief Financial Officer. As you know, the purpose of today's call is to review the NiSource's financial performance for 2015 as well as provide a business update covering our utility operations and growth drivers. We'll then open the call to your questions. As a reminder, we will be referring to supplemental slides that are available on the NiSource website.","Before moving on to our highlights for the quarter and the year, I would just remind everyone that we successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015. Therefore, the results for CPG are contained in discontinued operations.","And finally, one last reminder, some of the statements made on this call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factor sections of our periodic SEC filings.","With all that covered, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a dynamic year of progress for NiSource. Our teams executed on our customer focused, investment driven utility business plan, while successfully completing the Columbia Pipeline Group separation. We finished 2015 building on the momentum we've gained in the past few years, with an eye toward continued growth and enhanced performance in 2016 and beyond.","Let's take a look at slide three of the supplemental deck to walk through some of the significant milestones NiSource achieved in 2015. The NiSource team delivered strong financial results in line with expectations, with net operating earnings non-GAAP of $0.94 per share compared to $0.81 per share in 2014. We invested a record $1.37 billion in our utility infrastructure across our seven states. As part of that investment, we replaced 361 miles of priority pipe, including the last known cast iron pipe throughout the Columbia Gas of Virginia system.","All of NiSource's utility investments are focused on serving our customers, enhancing safety and service reliability, and reducing environmental impact. We reached a significant milestone during the year by completing the last of three flue gas desulfurization or FGD units at NIPSCO's coal generation facility. This is the culmination of approximately $850 million in investments over five years, all completed on schedule and on budget, that will help improve air quality and ensure that NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations.","Also in 2015, we completed the full deployment of automated meter reading devices across our nearly four million electric and natural gas customers. A six-year project, this new meter technology enhances customer service and safety while reducing costs. We also continued our electric transmission and distribution modernization program, investing about $65 million to improve service reliability and system performance.","NiSource has now executed against more than $2 billion of our identified $30 billion in long-term, regulated utility infrastructure investments since outlining these programs in 2014. In addition to these significant infrastructure investment milestones, the NiSource team completed several significant regulatory initiatives which support safety, reliability, employee training and customer programs. These milestones include successful rate case settlements in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; the extension of Columbia Gas of Virginia's system modernization program; approval of the first year of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts' gas system enhancement plan, and continued execution of Columbia Gas of Ohio's modernization program, along with new pipeline safety programs implemented in 2015.","We also had a strong performance in J.D. Power's residential natural gas customer satisfaction survey, with Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania an award winner for the second straight year and Columbia Gas of Virginia recognized as one of the nation's most improved brands. Across NiSource, we are sharpening our focus on service to our customers and communities, and these results reflect those commitments.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on page four of our supplemental slides. Donald?","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, these results no longer include CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The financial progress we're reporting today for 2015 was driven exclusively by our regulated utility businesses.","As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015, compared with about $256 million or $0.81 per share in 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported $832 million for 2015, which is an increase of about $54 million over 2014.","Taking a closer look at the annual operating earnings performance of our two utility business segments, our Gas Distribution segment delivered about $568 million compared with about $517 million in 2014.","Net revenue excluding the impact of trackers were up by more than $105 million, primarily due to the impact of new rates in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and implementation of rates under our approved infrastructure replacement programs in a number of states.","Operating expenses including the impact of trackers increased by about $55 million mainly due to higher employee and administrative costs as well as increased depreciation and property taxes as a result of higher capital investments.","Our Electric Operations segment reported about $280 million compared to about $288 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers were relatively flat. Operating expenses again excluding trackers increased by about $10 million, primarily due increased depreciation driven by higher capital investments.","As Joe mentioned, our 2015 results are well in line with our expectations. Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.","Now, turning to slide five, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $6.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and an interest rate of approximately 5.88%.","On the liquidity front, at the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.2 billion. And our credit ratings at the three major agencies remain solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to, as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities.","Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued growth and execution. I'd also note that the recent extension of bonus depreciation has no impact on our 2016 earnings guidance or long-term growth commitments. Consistent with what we've shared previously, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.10 in 2016. And in the years ahead, we continue to expect annual dividend and earnings growth of 4% to 6%.","Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Donald. As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom we're privileged to serve. Earlier in the call I mentioned that Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Virginia were recognized for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power. In fact, I'm proud to say, J.D. Power scores improved at all NiSource utilities in 2015 compared to the prior year.","We were recognized in other areas as well, including being named for the second consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, illustrating our deep commitment to serving customers, employees and other stakeholders in a way that balances immediate and long-term benefits. And NiSource was named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute for the fourth straight year.","Let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on slide six. We continue to focus on timely recovery of our customer-focused infrastructure investments and we continued to make progress on that front in the fourth quarter. At NIPSCO Gas, the team continues to execute on our seven year, $817 million natural gas system modernization program. We filed our semi-annual tracker and program update in August of last year and expect a commission order in the first quarter of this year. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas.","In December, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received commission approval of a settlement in its base rate case. The settlement maintains the company's ability to continue replacing and upgrading its natural gas distribution system. New rates went into effect on December 18, and will increase annual revenues by approximately $28 million. The settlement also included new incentives that will significantly reduce initial costs for customers converting to natural gas.","On November 1, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts implemented new rates under its previously approved base rate case settlement. The settlement supports CMA's continued effort to modernize its pipeline infrastructure and transform its operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. The approved settlement provides for increased annual revenues of $32.8 million, with an additional $3.6 million annual increase starting on November 1 of this year.","Across our gas utilities, we invested over $900 million in 2015, and expect to invest more than $950 million this year.","Now, let's turn to our Electric Operations on slide seven. On December 16, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved a settlement between NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest industrial customers, which resolved all outstanding issues raised by parties in an Indiana Court of Appeals proceeding related to the company's previous long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan.","Following that development, NIPSCO, on December 31, filed a new $1.3 billion, seven-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the IURC. The plan is focused on electric transmission and distribution investments made for safety, reliability and system modernization. NIPSCO expects an order on its seven-year plan by the third quarter of 2016.","Progress also continued to two major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. Line and tower construction is expected to begin in 2016. These projects involve an investment of approximately $450 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.","NIPSCO remains on schedule with its electric base rate case filed in October with the IURC. The case seeks to update rates to reflect the current costs of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including programs that have reduced the duration of power outages by 40%.","We have worked with our customers and other stakeholders to seek a balanced solution that recognizes the importance and value of reliable and affordable energy for all customers, particularly the energy intensive steel and industrial sectors in Northwest Indiana. The Indiana team has made progress with settlement discussions with the possibility of reaching a final settlement as early as tomorrow in order to meet the procedural deadline. As you would expect, we are in sensitive discussions at this point and I will not be able to provide any details beyond what I've noted.","We invested about $400 million in our electric business in 2015 and expect to invest more than $400 million in 2016. We took positive steps to position the business for future investment driven growth that will create value for NIPSCO customers, northern Indiana communities and our shareholders.","Before turning to your questions, I would like to reinforce NiSource's investment proposition and our 2016 guidance. As Donald already highlighted, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of a $1.0 to a $1.10 in 2016, with approximately $1.4 billion in infrastructure enhancements planned during the year.","Our well-established utility investment programs continued to produce high value for our customers and investors in 2015. As we begin our first full year as a pure play utility company, we are sharpening our focus on leadership and safety and customer satisfaction to unlock the full potential of our plan.","Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Kat?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Your line is open please go ahead.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","Thank you, good morning.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Charles.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","On the \u2013 you made the statement Joe. All right, it was you, that the bonus depreciation has no impact on earnings.","But with bonus deprecation, does that get you to the higher end maybe of your dividend growth with the extra \u2013 little bit of extra cash flow?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah Charles, that was Donald, who made that statement. And we haven't decided or made any move in terms of dividend outlook, we continue to guide 4% to 6% earnings per share and dividend growth, based on the plan that we have. I'll ask Donald to maybe add a little bit more insight about the effect of bonus depreciation on our plan and the optionality that it creates for us.","Donald E. Brown - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yeah. I think we've talked about bonus depreciation and our tax position in the past. Previously to this extension of bonus depreciation we had NOLs that were going to last until mid-2018. With this extension it actually pushes our NOLs to 2020, so it's probably 2021 where we're a net tax payer. And while this has a negative impact on rate base, it does give us that cash at the kind of tailwind of our planning horizon, to give us cash that we can spend a little bit more on CapEx in the early years, a nominal amount, to offset that negative impact on rate base, and by the end of the planning horizon actually be a net cash flow positive.","So, it keeps our earnings guidance and dividend guidance in line, and on the back end of our planning horizon gives us some incremental cash and provides some flexibility in our liquidity.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. That was the only question I had. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Barry Klein with Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Barry Klein - Macquarie Funds Group","Hey, guys.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Barry.","Barry Klein - Macquarie Funds Group","Good morning. Can you provide some guidance on rate base growth, and any equity needs over the next few years?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. No, near-term outlook for equity needs. Rate base growth continues to run at a high single-digit percentage clip for us, based on our $1.4 billion of CapEx this year and a fairly consistent outlook beyond that. And then, as we had noted even back at the time of separation, the 4% to 6% EPS growth over the long-term does factor in the eventual need for equity, but it's not in the near-term of the plan and nor do we expect that to change.","Barry Klein - Macquarie Funds Group","Okay. So that's how you reconcile, without any equity, high single-digit rate base growth because it's more longer term equity needs, is that how I should think about it?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's part of it. There are a number of other factors. Regulatory lag, continued steps through the regulatory process, some O&M growth as well. But yeah, that's a fair statement.","Barry Klein - Macquarie Funds Group","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Joe and Donald. How are you?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Paul. Doing well.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can you just give a sense of what's happening in the steel sector in Indiana and \u2013 basically, what you're seeing there?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We've obviously paid close attention to what's happening in the steel sector, a very key part of our industrial customer base and a key part of the fabric of the economy in northwest Indiana. What we believe we're seeing is sort of a leveling off at a capacity that's reflective of what you see across the nation, in the probably 70% range. Our load for last year reflects that kind of a usage pattern. And frankly, if you took out 2014, industrial sales for NIPSCO electric, you'd see 2015 fairly representative of the prior number of years. So a flat load profile in terms of the outlook for NIPSCO electric. And we continue to see that \u2013 sort of lower level of production, but fairly stable is the way we look at it right now.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","As you talk to your steel customers, any light at the end of the tunnel or just too early?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's too early to say that. Better to let them speak to that. But certainly as I noted earlier, a key part of our focus in wanting to find balanced solutions that help make sure that those customers \u2013 we're doing our part to ensure the viability of that part of the economy in northwest Indiana.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then I got distracted on something else, but you said you're looking for a potential NIPSCO settlement as early as tomorrow?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I did say that. Yes.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's something that we're optimistic about making progress on. I can't say much more about it, but given the procedural schedule, we're hoping for the opportunity to do something on that front in the next day or two, next business day or two.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Given your upbeat tone on that, maybe I can congratulate you early on getting there.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You could be the first then. Thank you.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Take care, guys. Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on kind of what takes you within the 4% to 6% earnings growth. What swings you from \u2013 what are the swing factors within the range?","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. Good morning, Greg. When you look at the profile of our seven companies, the ongoing investment levels and regulatory mechanisms, combination of rate cases and trackers in any given year the range of potential regulatory outcomes is probably the biggest single factor that could move our earnings outlook within that range, and that's a well-diversified mix of regulatory mechanisms. Each state has either a rate case as in Pennsylvania's fully forecasted rate year mechanism or a tracker mechanism that are already well established. So we tend to have a fairly confident outlook within the range, but nonetheless can see a number of things that could change in any given year relative to the mix of regulatory outcomes. Beyond that, I would say there is O&M \u2013 O&M variability could be storm-related, could be operationally related in any given year, by far the largest factor is going to be regulatory.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock, Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks.","Joseph J. Hamrock - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kat. And thank you again for joining us this morning. We certainly appreciate your ongoing interest and support in the NiSource's story and look forward to providing additional updates in the not-too-distant future. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."]}}
