All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2018 conference call.","Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning. As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share $0.17 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.12 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter revenue of $9.19 billion was up $1.51 billion or 19.7%. Of this number, approximately 3% represents organic revenue growth with the remainder coming from the acquisition of CSRA.","Net earnings of $786 million were up $37 million or 4.9% on the strength of a $21 million improvement in operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate offset in part by higher interest expense. This was particularly impressive given the $70 million of one-time costs in the quarter related to the acquisition of CSRA but a little more on that from Jason in a minute.","Sequentially, the story is much the same. Revenue was up $1.65 billion or 21.9% and operating earnings were up $80 million or 7.9% on the lower operating margins attributable to the $45 million of the $70 million one-time costs associated with the acquisition of CSRA reported as corporate operating earnings. The other $25 million was reported in other expense.","Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. Revenue was up $1.61 billion or 10.6% against the first half of 2017 for the same reasons, both the acquisition of CSRA and organic growth. On the other hand, operating earnings were down $17 million burdened by the aforementioned $45 million of cost in connection with the CSRA acquisition and increased amortization. Earnings from continuing operations were up $73 million, a 4.8% increase. EPS was $0.33 better, a 6.7% increase.","In short, we had a very good second quarter and first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. The CSRA acquisition performed as expected. Impressively, the acquisition would have been accretive in the quarter absent the onetime period of costs associated with it. These onetime period of costs burdened EPS by $0.20 per share in the quarter. The acquisition will be accretive to EPS in the second half mostly in the fourth quarter. And again, Jason will give you a little bit more color on this in a moment.","Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half and then I'll ask Jason for some comments on the CSRA acquisition cash, backlog, and taxes, before I conclude with some comments on the outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year.","First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $386 million were $183 million and $35 million lower respectively, but consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to an impressive 20.4%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $70 million and operating earnings were up $40 million on a 140 basis point improvement in operating margin.","We enjoyed brisk order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was a strong 1.3 to 1. This brings the book-to-bill to 1 to 1 for the first half and for the last 12 calendar months as well. One year ago at the end of the second quarter, the Aerospace funded backlog was $12.12 billion. At the end of this quarter, it was $12.19 billion.","Total backlog is up from $12.24 billion to $12.34 billion. Total estimated contract value is up $14.15 billion to $14.63 billion. So as you can see, we have had very good order performance for a full year now. The 650 and 650ER led the way in the quarter. The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well.","We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early orders, contract discussions and our pipeline. In short, we expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. Book-to-bill should be 1 to 1 or better in the second half better than that in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter because of higher anticipated deliveries. However, we could do a bit better in the fourth quarter.","As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20. This now paves the way for pilot training in the third quarter and deliveries commencing early fourth quarter with a few possibly in Q3. G600 flying continues to go well. We look forward to certification in the fourth quarter of this year.","In May, we also closed the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. It adds to Jet's global footprint, demonstrating a willingness to invest in support of our customers in locations convenient to them. This business will be part of a Jet Aviation-Gulfstream strategy to support a joint service effort outside of the United States.","Let me now turn to the defense side of the house. At the outset, let me say that the collective revenue of the defense businesses was up 7.1% over the year ago quarter excluding the impact of CSRA.","Turning to the individual segments, Combat Systems had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.53 billion was $120 million more than the second quarter last year, up 8.5%. Similarly, operating earnings were $236 million, up $11 million, or 5% over the second quarter of 2017. I should remind everybody that the second quarter of 2017 represented a 9% improvement over second quarter 2016 in revenue and almost 10% in operating earnings. So we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for two years now.","On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $94 million or 6.5% and operating earnings were up $12 million or 5.4%. For the first half, revenue was up $273 million, slightly in excess of 10% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were up $30 million or 7%. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolio.","The Army continues to exploit the versatility of the Stryker with a $260 million contract in the quarter to upgrade the electronics, power and communications on the vehicle. This contract is part of the Army's plan to similarly upgrade all of their nine Stryker Brigades.","We also received a $440 million order to upgrade Abrams tanks to the Version 3.0 configuration, which provides improved power, survivability and lethality. The continued monetization of our platforms in the coming years is, for the first time in a while, manifest in explicit program direction for the tank and the Stryker which puts us in good stead for continued growth.","Our international programs continue to see nice growth as well. Work on the UK AJAX program is transitioning to production from engineering with peak production in 2021. We are obviously trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story.","With respect to the Marine segment, revenue of $2.17 billion was $89 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $17 million against the year ago quarter on a 40 basis point expansion in operating profit. Similar to Combat Systems, the 2017 quarter experienced nice growth in both revenue and earnings against the same quarter in 2016. So once again, two years of good growth.","On a sequential basis, revenue was up $134 million and operating earnings were up $11 million at 6.6% and 6% respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.2 billion was up $189 million or 4.7% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were also up by $40 million or 11.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin to 9%.","Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine, continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long lead material for the Block V. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded later this year.","With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 boat and the DDG-51 restart ships are largely behind us with nice performance from the DDG-1001 and 1002 and on the follow on DDG-51 ships. We expect a multi-year contract to be awarded later this year for the DDG-51 Flight III upgrade.","Finally, surface repair at NASSCO had a slower start than anticipated this year but will ramp up in the second half. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.","We are now reporting what was IS&T in two segments: first, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and second, Information Technology, one of the industry's largest providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies, and federal civilian agencies.","Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of $95 million or 9% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $153 million were steady against the second quarter last year as a result of a 120 basis point drop in operating margin due to program mix in the quarter. We expect that mix to improve in the second half.","Mission Systems reports internally in three lines of business: ISR systems, communications, and platforms and sensors. Growth year-to-date for Mission Systems was primarily in ISR, in particular space payloads and encryption, and in communications.","On a sequential basis, revenue was up $49 million and earnings were up $7 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $105 million or 4.9%. Once again, first half earnings were steady against the first half of last year. Mission Systems has been a good growth business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 in 2016, 2017 and the first half of 2018.","Information Technology reported revenue of $2.44 billion in the second quarter. CSRA's contribution in the quarter was $1.29 billion. The revenue of Legacy GDIT was up $96 million or 9.1% excluding CSRA against the year ago quarter.","Operating earnings were $156 million with a $72 million contribution from CSRA, which includes $62 million of an amortization charge as a result of the transaction. Margin was 6.4% versus 8.3% the year ago quarter as a result of CSRA intangible asset amortization.","On a year-to-date basis, revenue was $3.58 billion, was up $1.4 billion. Importantly, revenue in the first half was up $176 million or 8.3% excluding the impact of CSRA. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up $80 million or 45.2%. Operating margins of 7.2% compares with the first half of last year of 8.4% consistent with the second quarter results.","Our integration of CSRA into GDIT is going well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goal.","The strength of GDIT post acquisition is in the experience of both GDIT and CSRA in developing cost effective solutions for its customers and leveraging this experience across multiple agencies. Both companies are excellent at transitioning old IT solutions to secure cloud-based solutions that are easier to operate and maintain. Together, we are even better. We expect this to be a competitive and powerful combination of talent and know how.","So, in summary, in the quarter, General Dynamics accomplished a number of key strategic objectives and delivered solid operating results. We closed on the largest acquisition in GD's history, expanded Jet Aviation's service network in Australia and the Asia Pacific region, and grew earnings and backlog.","I'll now turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year.","Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement and, in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, are the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portion of these costs, largely related to change of control provisions, are reported in our operating earnings as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, while the balance, legal, accounting, and other advisory fees, is reported in other income and expense.","In the quarter, we recognized $45 million of transaction costs in corporate operating earnings and $25 million in other expenses below the line for a total of $70 million in the quarter. You'll recall, we recognized $5 million of these one-time fees and other expenses in the first quarter and we anticipate the final payments in the third quarter to bring us to a total transaction cost of $80 million or $0.23 per share. Including these onetime charges, we expect corporate operating costs and the other below the line expenses to each be approximately $25 million for the year.","Turning to net interest expense, we reported $103 million in the quarter, compared to $24 million in the second quarter of 2017. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $130 million versus $49 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $355 million versus our initial pre-acquisition January guidance of $115 million.","Wrapping up the discussion of CSRA, the second quarter numbers include provisional amounts related to purchase accounting for CSRA. Although, not final, we believe we have good estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the related amortization expense. These estimates are very much in line with what we reported in our recent 8-K filing associated with this transaction, which are approximately $2 billion of intangible assets and a $190 million of amortization for the nine months of 2018.","Moving on from CSRA, our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter which is consistent with our full year outlook. You'll recall, our first quarter tax rate was somewhat lower due to the timing of benefits associated with equity compensation deductions so the rate for the first half of the year was 17.9%. That quite naturally implies a rate higher than 19% for the balance of the year to net a full year rate of 19%.","Turning to capital deployment, we paid $276 million in dividend in the second quarter. We also purchased 900,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.1 million shares for the first half of the year for $436 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Our focus for the balance of the year will be on paying down the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, consistent with the near-term maturity structure that we established.","We generated $787 million of cash from operations in the quarter and, after capital expenditures of $175 million, we have free cash flow of $612 million, a conversion rate of nearly 80%. That resulted in a net cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and a net debt position of $12.4 billion.","For the year we expect free our cash flow to be in the low to mid 90% range reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional $255 million discretionary pension contribution that we discussed last quarter, which we paid in the third quarter.","Lastly, a couple of highlights on our backlog. First, the addition of CSRA brought $5.3 billion of firm backlog to the company along with $8.5 billion of IDIQ and unexercised options, what we refer to as estimated potential contract value. In addition to this incremental backlog, the combined GDIT-CSRA had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times in the quarter bringing them to 1.1 times for the first half of the year.","And one last point regarding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it relates to backlog. While FX rates had a de minimis impact on our reported sales and earnings in the quarter, changes in the rates from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter reduced our Combat Systems and Mission Systems backlogs by approximately $370 million and $75 million respectively. Excluding this impact, these two groups had a book-to-bill in the quarter of 0.9 times and 1 to 1 respectively.","In fact, our defense businesses in aggregate had a book-to-bill of 0.9 times in the quarter and first six months of the year and that includes a very lumpy Marine Systems where, as Phebe noted, we anticipate some very large additions to the backlog in the form of a multi-year DDG and Virginia Block V contract later this year. Combined with the strong order activity and ongoing environment that Phebe described in the Aerospace group, we're set up to continue what's developing as a very nice growth story.","That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you a wrap up including our updated guidance for the year.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion up $220 million to $270 million from 2017, operating earnings slightly in excess of $1.5 billion and operating margin of around 18%.","We now expect revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, with earnings roughly consistent with our January forecast. This implies pressure on margins in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter when G500 deliveries begin in earnest.","For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, up $200 million to $250 million from 2017 with operating earnings around $970 million on an operating margin of around 15.7%. We now expect revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, operating earnings of approximately $990 million, with an operating margin around 15.5%, so approximately $150 million more revenue and $20 million more in operating earnings.","For the Marine segment, we previously guided to revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, margins are at $8.7 billion and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion with margins slightly better than the previous forecast resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million.","For IS&T, we guided to revenue of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, up $400 million to $500 million from 2017, operating earnings of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast for the two legacy businesses is between $9.4 million and $9.5 billion. Rather than taking it any further of the old IS&T level, let me break it into the new business segments.","First, Mission Systems. Their outlook for this year is revenue between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion with margins around 14%. This implies significant growth in revenue and earnings in the second half. Second, legacy GDIT will have revenue for the year of about $4.6 billion with margins around 8%. CSRA will add about $3.75 billion of revenue with operating margins growing 6%.","So IT rolls up revenue of between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion with operating earnings around $600 million and margins around 7%. So all of this sums to revenue for GD about $36.7 billion to $36.8 billion and operating margins somewhat in excess of 12%.","Compared to our initial guidance, we will have higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $10.90 to $11 to a range of $11 to $11.05. This increased outlook overcomes what we expect to be a $0.23 per share negative impact from all the charges related to the CSRA acquisition. Apart from those fees and expenses, we expect CSRA's contribution to be $0.11 this year. The difference then is from GD operating improvement.","With that, I'll turn it back to Howard and address your questions.","Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, Sir. Today's first question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think one topic that's sort of in the back of everybody's mind, if you could maybe put some perspective on it is one of the suppliers on the G500 is having financial difficulty, filed for bankruptcy and they're a supplier to you, your supplier Pratt Canada, so the Northern Group. I mean, how should investors think about what potential impact that could have and what it means? Because we're just getting a lot of questions on it and I think people just want to get a sense on how you're thinking about that.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So the current issue will have some impact on our deliveries to some extent this year but it is solvable. Let's remember that the (34:30) as manufactured and designed was approved through the FAA certification process. We are confident in that the parties will expeditiously resolve their dispute. Let's also \u2013 I think it's important to remember, this is really a terrific engine. It's quiet, its performance is superior and its highly efficient. So we will get through this.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So basically, I guess, is there any way you can give a \u2013 how disruptive could it be or not? Just kind of that kind of thing. Like, Phebe, everybody sort of worries about these things when they come up. And we've seen them come and go in the past and in the end, it don't usually amount to much. But if you could give people comfort on that, that would really be helpful.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes, so this year, to the extent it affects some of the G500 deliveries, margins will go up and our earnings are going to be flat. So I'm pretty comfortable that we will get through this and the sooner we get through it, the better. But this is all solvable. And frankly, we can manage through this as can Pratt.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, okay, great. I'll leave it there and let someone else ask their question. Thank you.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hi, good morning, Phebe and Jason.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","I wanted to just ask a closely related two-parter here on G500, G600. You've commented recently about in the impact on margins there as we look forward to next couple of years and my understanding is that's some non-recurring cost that you have to layer in on those initial production lots. How long does that stretch in terms of time that those impacts will be there for the G500 and G600? And then secondly, you talked about the G500 weighing on margins in the fourth quarter on those initial deliveries. Do you still expect those deliveries to be profitable, but still just dilutive to the overall Gulfstream or Aerospace margin? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes, they will be profitable. The first lot of airplanes tends to carry program costs that reduce margins. That said, we have always demonstrated superb operating performance in the manufacturing of our airplanes. So we will \u2013 as soon as we get through that, margins will ramp up very nicely on the G500 and G600.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","And does that happen in 2021?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","It'll happen before that. We've just got to get through a handful of the G500s and off we go.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Phebe, you mentioned that demand for the G650 is still very strong. I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what the current lead time is on that aircraft. And previously, you indicated that you might want to bring production down on that model. Is that still the case?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So we have begun to ramp down production on the G650 and will continue to do so, the pace at which, however ,we're going to have to discern as we do our plans for 2019 because the order book has been so strong. So the G650 is doing frankly quite nicely. What was the first part of your question?","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","The lead time, if I was to order one today.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","The lead time. So the lead times are well within our comfortable range of about 18 months. All of our airplanes are in a very comfortable range.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And today's next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, David.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Phebe. So I wanted to follow up. Jason made the comment about deleveraging from here. I guess you have $2.5 billion in commercial papers. So can you talk about the pace at which you plan to delever? And then also on cash conversion, you touched on kind of mid-90s this year. What should we think about going forward given the high amortization levels associated with CSRA? Thanks.","Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Hey, David. I think what you can expect in terms of deleveraging is that commercial paper that you see on the balance sheet that should be gone by the end of the year and you'll see call it roughly similar reductions for the next couple of years following that, all consistent with the maturities in our existing ladder. So that will all come as scheduled on maturity.","With respect to free cash flow, we'll continue to target to be in the 90s to 100% range moving forward, all subject obviously as we've mentioned to investment for growth particularly in Marine Systems, but we'll continue to be in that 90s to 100% range as we look forward.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. I just wanted to go back to some comments, Phebe, that you made a little bit earlier in the year and make sure I understand them in detail. I thought that maybe for 2019 and 2020 we were going to be looking at the Aerospace margins coming down 200 to 300 basis points from the 2018 baseline. And I want to see if that's still the case and if not what's changed?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So, look, our margins are going to be just fine. I'm not going to get into 2019 and 2020. That will all depend on our build rate, but we are going to be quite comfortable in our margin performance as we frankly always are at Gulfstream. So I wouldn't give that too much worry.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","There are going to be margin compressions because we got mix issue. That should be understood and fairly explicable. So we're in pretty good shape on that score.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Phebe, you talked about the strong demand signals you're seeing in the market right now at Gulfstream. Could you give us a little more insight into how that goes by geography, customer type? And just have to ask, are you seeing any impact from the coming introduction of the new Bombardier models?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So our order book is heavily North America with strong European interest and some increase in the Asia Pacific region, pretty consistent with the way \u2013 to the previous patterns of the order activity. Across the portfolio, the order book tends to be divided roughly in thirds by private company's high net worth individuals and public companies.","So, look, our backlog is very durable and we understand who's in it. Many of them have been longtime customers. And the order activity continues. I think I've told you before, we're not very concerned about that airplane. We continue to sell the G650 at a good rate and we have some compelling attributes not satisfied with the 7500, including better range at restricted airports and more range at speed. I'd recommend that perhaps some folks should do some product comparisons that could help illuminate our lack of concern on that score.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I was wondering, if you could talk a little about Combat Systems. Just trying to think about the balance as we go forward and I guess this is even beyond this year with the recapitalization in the U.S., which I typically think is somewhat lower margin, but also looks like we're seeing strength in European defense spending and how that plays out for ELS and just thinking about the margin mix and the growth as we go forward there.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So we're very comfortable with the growth estimates that we gave you for our long range plan back in January and that those estimates are undergirded by exactly the elements that you note. Interestingly, I have been watching the army for a very long time and under the leadership of Secretary Esper and General Milley, we've seen a focus on modernization to an extent that arguably hasn't been seen since the 1980s when the Army fielded the Big Five and they're budgeting their resources to support their modernization plan. They've also been working with industry very closely, which is very wholesome as we work to ensure that they get the best of class technologies and capabilities.","So I'm very pleased with the demand signals coming out of the United States. The same is true in Europe. Our European Land Systems is growing at a nice rate and the book-to-bill in that whole business has been very wholesome. Combat, as I noted in my remarks, has been a growth engine for us for the last two years and will continue to be so. So, we like what we're seeing in Combat.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you so much. So yesterday when Lockheed Martin reported they had a substantial increase in their revenue guidance for this year and they were making the point that they're seeing DoD kind of put new business under contract sooner than they had expected and early flow-through of the large Omnibus add-ons in the FY 2018 budget. Are you seeing any of that because you look like you have relatively modest revenue hikes for this year? So...","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","I thought we were...","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","...are your numbers conservative?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","I thought we were growing nicely. Hey, look, I don't know what...","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","I didn't say you weren't growing nicely, but it looks like \u2013 I mean, I'm just asking is this kind of a conservative number so it may have upside or is this kind of right down the fairway? How should we think about that?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","I never comment on others. I can simply tell you that our revenue estimates are very consistent \u2013 today, are pretty consistent with where we were when we set this plan. We have a great deal of insight into our customers and their spend rates. And I think it's certainly in Marine, that's very steady predictable growth. Right?","Combat is much the same way to the extent that we've seen some surprises, frankly, in the growth rate have been at CSRA and GDIT which grew very, very nicely. And we'll continue to do so and we've reflected that in our updated guidance. So no particular surprises here, frankly. We've been pretty forthright with you all on what we expected and that's what's happened and what is happening.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. Phebe, on Aerospace, the increase in revenues is primarily Hawker Pacific or were there additional deliveries? Could you provide what the updated deliveries might be? And then also on the margin with no G500 deliveries in the third quarter...","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Whoa, I didn't say no. Go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Sorry about that. The increase in Aerospace guidance is primarily from the acquisition of Hawker Pacific or there're increased deliveries as well? And then second part of it is, with no G500 deliveries in Q3, you should have another strong margin, would imply that the fourth quarter margin would be 15% or less. I mean, is that a fair characterization? Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So as I mentioned to you, we may have a few G500 deliveries in the third quarter. We said consistently that that first lot of G500s is going to carry lower margin and our guidance to you reflects that. The increase in revenue is a combination of a lot of different elements in this very complex portfolio, Hawker, mix in deliveries, increased service, so across sort of the whole canopy (49:01) of levers that present in any given quarter. That is our best estimate right now. I'm pretty confident in it in terms of the revenue and the earnings, frankly.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. I'll stick with the one question. Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, George.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Phebe, I was wondering if you could talk about Marine longer term and what your expectations are there from a margin standpoint and what your mix of work is going to be on Columbia versus Virginia class, what your current line of thinking there is? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So think about large shipbuilding programs and businesses is typically having margins in the 8% to 10% range depending on the maturity of the program. So that's the prism through which we should look at the Marine Group. That said, as we ramp up on Columbia, we will see some margin compression quite naturally because that will be cost plus work. And given the long duration of the shipbuilding contracts and the shipbuilding process itself for any one of these single submarines, that margin compression can obtain for a while offset, of course, by increased improvements in our Virginia class performance which we have historically shown.","So I don't have a good estimate right now for you of the out year estimate on the mix between Virginia and Columbia. Columbia will, in seven or eight years, completely dwarf or heavily dwarf Virginia. So it's simply because of the volume coming into the yard. Think about it this way, we start manufacture of that first Columbia in 20 and then it will ramp up pretty expeditiously through the next four or five years.","So we'll be able as we \u2013 I think I mentioned from time ago, we signed last year a detailed design contract. Part of that contract is a detailed plan that we worked out with the Navy on exactly the sequencing of the requirements and the build strategy and the funding to go along with that. Once we get that ironed out in the next year and a half to two years, then we'll have quite a bit of clarity on exactly what this very long range program looks like.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe, just on CSRA, it sounds like it's nicely accretive. Can you maybe update your thoughts on how you're thinking about still the synergies? And I know there's some costs that you get to hold on or some cost reduction you get to hold on to and some you give back. But how are you thinking about that now that you've had the business for a few months?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So our costs and savings have baked into our estimates for the year. And with respect to CSRA, our integration is going very, very well. We're right on target, in fact, a little ahead of schedule. I suspect we will continue to see increased synergies over time. The beauty of putting these two businesses together is we can take the best-in-class out of GDIT in the best-in-class out of legacy CSRA and really marry those capabilities for some pretty impressive performance in the marketplace.","The combined GDIT under the new GDIT has had a 75% win rate this year. That is pretty darn impressive for a highly competitive business. So I think that speaks to the power of the combination of these two businesses.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just sticking on CSRA, can you maybe elaborate how we should think about retention rates for that business whether it's the employee base or just contract renewals? And Phebe, if you could just expand a little bit about the integration targets you mentioned.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So we have added about $900 million in this quarter alone to \u2013 over $900 million in our backlog on the combined contracts. With respect to employees, we have retained every single employee that we have wanted to retain. And the beauty of this integration is that we're taking the management team of CSRA and the management team of GDIT and we have melded it into a very, very effective, cohesive management team with a vision on how they want to proceed.","They are melding the two cultures. They are bringing the best-in-class technical capabilities in each business and the customer intimacy in each business. So we're very pleased with our employee retention. We've had super contract generation. There have been frankly no surprises or disappointments in any of the contract activity since the acquisition.","It's interesting, just to give you a little bit of perspective on this. GDIT grew 9% and, for the quarter, CSRA grew 12.6% and that's the particularly impressive given their 9% growth in the quarter prior to the acquisition. These businesses are doing extremely well.","Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.","So we'll take one last question, operator.","Operator","Absolutely. Our last question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. I don't know if this is, Phebe, for you or Jason, but I wanted to try and get at normalized margins in Aero and in GDIT just given the somewhat unusual moving pieces in the back end of the year here. So while I know you don't want to talk about 2019, once we get past this early lot of G500s and I'd ask you how many aircraft are in that lot. How do we think about it? Does Aerospace get back to a 20% margin whenever that time is?","And then similar question on GDIT, how do we think about normalized margins there? Can CSRA get back to legacy GD levels or even higher?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah, Jason will address that.","Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Let me take the CSRA, GDIT side. I think the way we're looking at it is if you adjust for the amortization impact, the incremental amortization from the transaction, CSRA is actually contributing margins consistent with their historic performance, double-digit performance and is accretive to the margins of the group, again ex that amortization.","And a point on that, I noted in the remarks that we had \u2013 we're anticipating $190 million of amortization this year for the CSRA transaction. Under the accounting rules, that's actually an accelerated message. So we'll have $190 million for the nine months of this year followed by, I think, it's 200 million next year and then it'll ratchet down over time.","So you'll see that in a little more detail in the 10-Q we'll publish later today. But that will, I think, help you sort of model impacts on margin rates, if you think of core CSRA contribution ex amortization in the double-digit range consistent with their history. So that's sort of the story on the GDIT side.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","On Gulfstream, so one of the things that you should by now think about us as a superb operating company. So we'll get through the initial lot, fairly expeditiously and you may ask the number in that lot, but I don't intend to tell you.","And then begin our ramp down our learning curve. We've got synergies between the G500 and G600 lines because they are coproduced in the same facility. I'm not going to be predictive of how good can we get in the out years. But you can believe year in and year out, we will improve our performance on our airplanes.","Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Phebe and Jason, and everybody else who was listening today.

My name is Carissa, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, Carissa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Good morning to all, and thank you, Erin. For those of you who do not know, Erin is our new Director for Investor Relations. She's replaced Amy Gilliland who's been assigned to a broader portfolio, reporting directly to me. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the fourth quarter, which is dominated by the charges. You're going to hear more about that from Hugh Redd. I do intend to spend time -- some time giving you a sense of my thinking about 2012, and then spend a bit more time on 2013. I'll try to keep my remarks somewhat brief to provide sufficient time to address your questions.","With respect to the fourth quarter, I would focus you on the revenue drop versus the same quarter a year ago. The single largest cause of which is the revenue decline at European Land Systems. This is a salient fourth quarter impact that carries over into 2013, which we'll talk about in a bit more detail.","For the full year 2012, let's first talk about Aerospace. The group had notable growth. Sales and earnings increased by double-digits. At Gulfstream, both revenue and earnings were strong, with revenue up over $800 million and earnings up $110 million. There was some decrease in margin as a result of a mix shift toward early production G650 and 280s. Of course, we had higher default penalties in the prior year that somewhat inflated the 2011 margin.","Gulfstream also brought to market 2 clean sheet aircraft that entered into service pretty much on the schedule we first announced back to you in 2008. Jet Aviation performed better than 2011, with revenues up almost 10% and earnings better than last year without regard to charges. The management team at Jet has addressed the underlying operational performance issues in completion, and their processes are dependable going forward. In all, Aerospace had a good year and delivered on its promises.","Combat Systems. Sales as reported were lower by over $800 million and earnings before nonrecurring charges were down $215 million compared to the prior year. 75% of the sales decrease and 75% of the earnings decline were attributable to European Land Systems. In the North American-based businesses, sales were down somewhat at our shorter-cycle businesses, but Land Systems sales, earnings and margins were higher. And each of our U.S. businesses maintained double-digit margin.","So what can we deduce from this? First, in recognition of European fiscal realities, we are restructuring our European business and taking cost out to position us for the future. Second, our North American-based businesses performed extremely well given the current budget environment, particularly at the biggest business, Land Systems.","Let's move on to the Marine group. Sales were down less than 1% on timing of submarine and surface ship programs. Earnings were up 8.5% on good performance across all 3 of our shipyards. I particularly like the story at Electric Boat, the largest business. Revenue was down very modestly, and we had a 50 basis point margin improvement. NASSCO had outstanding performance and superb profit contribution on the T-AKE Program.","IS&T. As we reported, the group lost $1.2 billion of sales year-over-year and approximately $400 million of earnings before nonrecurring charges. C4 Systems sales decline was about 75% of the group's total decline. The earnings decline at C4 was about 2\/3 of the group's earnings decline, driven by lower revenue in general and a volume reduction in some of their higher-margin products in particular.","Our GD U.K. business accounted for approximately 20% of the sales decline as reported and 20% of the earnings decline before charges, in part from reduced volume and in part from some performance issues. Clearly, we are not pleased with the considerable decline in margins in this group, about 270 basis points without regard to charges.","In addition, the impact of dramatic sales and earnings decline in C4 and GD U.K. created a mix shift in the group toward lower margin IT services. Conversely, long second half orders, including orders at C4 for WIN-T HMS Rifleman and Manpack radios helped stabilized C4 moving forward. Think about it this way, C4 had a book-to-bill for 2012 greater than 1. The margin decline in this group is explicable, but the performance was disappointing at best and will be addressed.","In summary, for the entire entity, cash performance was strong. I liked Aerospace's excellent growth in both revenue and earnings. Combat Systems North American businesses performed well in the middle of a tough budget environment. The European combat vehicle business was a negative, but as you can see from the charges, we are addressing their cost structure this year. Marine remained steady with good operating performance. IS&T did not perform as anticipated, and we're going to work that hard in 2013. Our large powerful core platform businesses, Electric Boat, Gulfstream and Land Systems continue to perform at very high levels, generating EBIT, EBIT margins and cash.","So let's turn to 2013. With respect to revenue, our plan rolls up to somewhat less than a 1% sales increase over 2012, led by 16% growth at Aerospace, offset in part by a 3% to 4% decline in our Defense business. Combat and IS&T are each contributing about 50% of the decline, with Marine growth offsetting the decline somewhat. A reasonable range for sales this year is flat to up 1.5%. Operating earnings should be essentially flat when compared to 2012 results before nonrecurring items. The plan contemplates an overall operating margin in the mid-11% range, reflecting a slight compression compared to 2012 before nonrecurring items.","Aerospace and IS&T margins are planned to be better than 2012 margins before nonrecurring charges, offset by a decline in the Marine group margins and a slight drop at Combat Systems.","Here is how we plan to perform across our groups in greater detail. First, Aerospace. Our plan reflects a 16% sales growth led by Aerospace. Operating earnings are planned to increased 19% when compared with 2012 results before nonrecurring items. This represents increased margins of 40 basis points compared to 2012. Aerospace has additional revenue and earnings potential beyond the plan. Jet has stabilized its operations. Additional revenue opportunities in completions, if realized, would provide some improvement in profitability, though we remain properly cautious about this market.","At Gulfstream, margin improvement over plan is dependent on 650 performance. There is upside if we can beat planned cost performance on G650 manufacturing and completion.","Combat. Revenue is planned to be down approximately 6% when compared with 2012 group revenues as reported. The decline is attributable to a reduction in Combat theater-related services and in our shorter cycle U.S. businesses. The group's operating margin is anticipated to be in the mid-13%.","Marine group. Sales in the group are highly predictable and are planned up almost 2% from 2012. Earnings, however, are down on margin compression as a result of mix shift at NASSCO, caused entirely by the end of the highly successful T-AKE Program in 2012. The plan anticipates a Marine group operating margin of approximately 9.4%. This is still industry-leading performance by no small measure. That said, we will seek to improve these anticipated margins as we go forward through the year.","IS&T. Revenue is planned to be down against 2012 by almost 5%. Margins, however, are up 20 basis points against last year's performance before nonrecurring items. The margin increase is a result of improved performance, primarily at C4 Systems and at AIS as their plans have stabilized, and they drive cost out of their business.","In summary, as COO, I worked with our business units to develop realistic operating plans based on a comprehensive analysis program by program and our best assessment of risk and opportunity. We only recently finalized our operating plan to capture the current outlook as best we could. The plan contemplates a full year's continuing resolution and is reasonable, subject to some risk on the sales side in the event of sequestration and more draconian budget cuts than currently contemplated. Due to its short cycle businesses and O&M exposure, the IS&T outlook will remain most sensitive to any additional budget cuts that may occur.","Our margins have been good apart from recent IS&T performance, but there's plenty of room for improvement. We will be working cost-cutting initiatives across all of our lines of business. I'll have more to say about that later in the year.","The opportunities for upside, and they are significant, are on margin improvement, cash generation and driving performance side of the equation. We will focus this year on operations to drive cost out of our businesses and improve performance. But I do not intend to guide you to higher operating margins than are currently embedded in our plan because we have yet to earn them.","I'll now turn over the mic to Hugh Redd to provide you detail on the charges and other items.","L. Hugh Redd","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I intend to discuss in detail the charges in the quarter, including goodwill impairment and a few other miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period. But before I discuss the goodwill impairment, I would like to address other discrete charges, which impact the fourth quarter by segment.","First impacting the Aerospace group. We recorded a $191 million impairment of intangible assets associated with Jet Aviation's maintenance business. Jet's business, particularly in Europe, has been impacted negatively by recent economic conditions and an increasingly competitive marketplace, where we are seeing OEMs perform maintenance work that was previously performed by third-parties like Jet. As a result of these market trends, in the fourth quarter, we reviewed the long-lived assets associated with Jet's maintenance business and eliminated the remaining value of the intangible assets. We have repositioned Jet's maintenance business to match anticipated future demand and as a result, expect it to remain profitable in the future.","Next, impacting the Combat group. We recorded a charge of $405 million related to our European Land Systems business. Included in this amount is $292 million for accruals for contract disputes, primarily related to our contract with the government of Portugal for 260 Pandur vehicles. During the quarter, we were notified by the Portuguese Minister of National Defense that the contract was terminated for an alleged breach of contract. Subsequent to that notification, the customer has drawn $73 million on bank guarantees related to the contract. While we have asserted that we are not in breach of the contract and that the termination of the contract was invalid, we reserved the receivables and inventory on our books and accrued an estimate to satisfy the remaining obligations to close out the contract.","We filed a demand for arbitration to protect our rights, but the outcome is difficult to predict given the customers' behavior to date. The other significant items in the charge for our European Land Systems business are $98 million of restructuring-related costs and $50 million of inventory write-downs. Late in the fourth quarter, we committed to a restructuring plan to eliminate excess capacity and align the size of our European business with future demand. This amount consists primarily of severance costs, which are expected to be paid in 2013.","The next 2 discrete charges in the quarter impacted the Information Systems and Technology group. In the quarter, we recorded a $110 million impairment of intangible assets associated with a prior acquisition in the optical products area of the business. As a result of competitive losses and award delays in the fourth quarter, we reviewed the livelong -- the long-lived assets of this business for impairment and eliminated much of their remaining value.","Also in the quarter, we recorded $38 million to write-off obsolete inventory, primarily ruggedized computers and associated parts inventory as projected sales are not likely to materialize.","The goodwill impairment also impacted the IS&T segment. During the fourth quarter, we conducted the required goodwill impairment test just as we do every year. For 3 of our segments, step 1 of the test resulted in estimated fair values far in excess of book values as of 12\/31\/2012. For IS&T however, the book value exceeded the estimated value. Accordingly, we performed a very detailed step 2 of the test for the IS&T segment, which resulted in a $2 billion impairment loss, which has been recorded in the fourth quarter results.","Some further background on this noncash charge. Since its formation in 1997, our IS&T segment has completed 38 acquisitions. The goodwill associated with these 38 acquisitions totaled $8.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012 and represented 58% of the total company goodwill. As we've been discussing for several quarters and as Phebe outlined, IS&T has experienced continued top line pressure, resulting from slow defense spending in their markets and margin compression due to mix shift and cost performance. In fact, from its high point in 2010, revenues in IS&T are down almost 14% and margins have declined 270 basis points.  Accordingly, our projection of future cash flow from IS&T has been impacted, leading to a lower estimated fair value than we have calculated in prior years. The impairment charges reduced the carrying value of IS&T goodwill by 25%.","Leaving the segment charges behind, net interest expense was $41 million for the quarter versus $38 million in 2011. For 2012, our interest expense for the full year was $156 million, right in line with our prior estimates. For 2013, we expect net interest expense to decline to approximately $90 million, reflecting the full year impact of our $2.4 billion debt refinancing, which we completed in December 2012. As you know, that refinancing lowered our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 2.2% and extended our average maturities by 7 years.","There was a charge of $123 million included in other expense in the quarter related to the bond redemption premium for the refinancing. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects approximately $600 million of net debt, a reduction of $400 million from the prior year. The reported effective tax rates are somewhat meaningless for comparative purposes, and with that in mind, I'll address them.","The effective tax rate was negative 2.8% for the quarter and a positive 161.4% for the full year. The fourth quarter rate and the full year rate were impacted significantly by the fact that the discrete charges had either reduced or no tax benefit. For 2013, we expect an effective tax rate around 32%, taking into consideration the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit, the impact for 2012 and 2013 being recognized in the 2013 rate.","The operating cost attributable to corporate were $69 million for the full year 2012 versus $77 million for 2011. The amount for 2013 will be closer to $90 million. During 2012, we contributed approximately $530 million in cash to our pension plans. For 2013, our funding expectation is approximately $600 million, with 60% of that funding occurring during the third quarter.","Finally, we ended the year with $3.3 billion in cash, and as I said, net debt of $600 million. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong credit ratings. Our commitment will be evidenced by a disciplined capital deployment strategy throughout 2013.","That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn it back over to Erin for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan","Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Carissa, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The question I have is on IS&T margins, and you talked about up 20 basis points on a clean compare in 2012. I just want to make sure that's 8.2%, is that roughly the range?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And could you talk about what the step down has been structurally? Where is the long-term margin opportunity? And maybe for Hugh, was there an -- is there an amortization benefit that's coming in '13 to IS&T that's in that 8.2%?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Let me give you a little bit and then we'll let Hugh answer. Let me give you a little bit of color on 2012 margins and then 2013 margins, all right? We had, as I mentioned, about a 20 -- 270 basis point compression in 2012 margins. And the way I think about the margins is, is here's what's going on. We talked about C4 in '12, and we are confident that their reset plan reflects their market reality and shows considerable improvement year-over-year. The IS&T services have become an increasingly large segment in IS&T, the IT services, and GDIT is a lower margin business than the other IT businesses. Going forward, there are 2 main drivers for 2013, C4 sales and earnings and margins are up in '13 as against '12 before nonrecurring charges, and their margin expansion is around 80 basis points. We've also addressed the operational problems at GD U.K., and we have some stabilization there as well. Offsetting that margin improvement is IT services has about a $350 million lower revenue target and margin compression of about 50 basis points. So net-net, that's how we're rolling up to about an 8.2% margin. Hugh, you want to address the amortization?","L. Hugh Redd","Yes, Myles, there will be less amortization in 2013. I think the number is probably $25 million, maybe slightly more. That has been reflected in the projections that Phebe has and the guidance she's given you.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I'll stick to one, but Phebe, is there a longer-term margin expansion story for IS&T or is this kind of what we should think about as the business?","Phebe N. Novakovic","There's a longer-term, and let me take this opportunity to explain that. One of the things that ought to be clear is that we have reset the IS&T plan across each one of the businesses, and we have done a very, very realistic program by program analysis that drove our revenue estimate by about 5% lower. And to fire test those assumptions, as part of our planning process, we used a parametric analysis based on several benchmarks including book-to-bill, established budgets and backlogs. So the result of where we're guiding you to in IS&T seems reasonable to me in both program assumptions and by application of the benchmarks. The history tell us a reasonable parametric test of our assumption. So when I think about IS&T, and let's talk about C4 in particular. This is a superb management team that given a realistic and reset plan and given their order book has margin potential. I'm just not going to lead you there, margin expansion potential. I'm just not going to lead you there yet. And that goes into -- that's relevant for '13 and '14. What we see over our long-range plan for IS&T is margin expansion across-the-board, but it's going to be slow and deliberative.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Gulfstream, could you give us some color on how many 650s did you deliver in the year? How many completions? And give us some color on the delivery assumptions behind your comments on Aerospace for 2013?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, look, we -- as I highlighted and will be re-highlighted in our press release, we delivered 37 aircraft to customers in the quarter, including 31 large cabins, and we're not going to breakout aircraft delivery by model type, and I certainly don't intend to going forward. I can tell you that based on what we reported before, we had 6 G650s that are into service in the fourth quarter. Let me give you a little bit of background on margins. Let's take '12, okay? Starting in the third and fourth quarter, margins were impacted by higher cost of goods sold in connection with the completions and retrofit work for the G650. As a result, we have a temporary disequilibrium between green production and completions as we accommodate some retrofit work out of cycle. We've got to work our way through that over the year. And so that leads me into 2013, and I talked to you about margins in 2013, there are 2 things driving. One is the mix shift, with the larger proportion of 650 and 280s with lower margins at the moment compared with 450s and 550s. It's also about 650 production, which I alluded to, and we have factored the green and completion production rates to account for the balance -- this imbalance in production flow from green completions that will take the duration of the year to resolve. Let me give you, I think it might be helpful for you to understand where we are, and I will give you some color, I think some real detail on how we're seeing our rates and our margins. So let's talk about 650 manufacturing. Overall, the manufacturing of these aircraft is going well. However, not surprisingly, due to the prolonged FAA certification process and our decision to continue manufacturing G650s during that process, there is currently this disequilibrium between initial and final phase manufacturing. And that disequilibrium is the result of retrofit work, mandated by changes to the configuration of initial G650 green aircraft after they were manufactured to conform with FAA approved configuration. So as I say, we've got through the margin guidance we've got in 2013. Anticipate taking the majority of the year to rebalance our initial phase and final phase production. We have some opportunity there, but I'm not willing to call it yet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to talk about cash. Cash relative to adjusted earnings for the full year came in below 100%. Can you talk about, a couple of things, cash conversion in 2013 and then how you plan on -- your plan in terms of deploying the cash, obviously, relative to some of your peers, your dividend yield is a little bit lower, share repurchase, you haven't been as aggressive, focusing more on acquisitions. So just wanted to hear what you were thinking in terms of deploying that cash? And it looks like your guidance for the year doesn't assume anything for share repurchase, if I'm correct?","Phebe N. Novakovic","That's correct. So let me give you a little bit on cash. And you've seen this in '12, and you're going to see it again in '13. Our cash generation in the underlying business continues to be superb. We have considerable CapEx in '12 and again in '13. In '13, we're planned at about $618 million. This is primarily at Gulfstream, and I can tell you we're going to work that number very, very hard. We also have some headwinds in cash with respect to pension, and as I mentioned, a higher CapEx. But let me talk to you a minute about some subject that's near and dear to my heart, and that's capital deployment. I think it should be clear from what I've told you is that I'm going to remain, and as is our management team, focused on operations in 2013. I can tell you, there is almost no acquisition candidates in the current pipeline. I also believe that the acquisition process at GD is somewhat broken, and I will not venture back into that market until we have reestablished the discipline in this process. And I can give you a little bit more color on this. If you consider the acquisitions that were made in Combat, Force Protection in particular, and the repair businesses in Marine, they were excellent. IS&T acquisitions haven't been so far. Regarding dividend and share repurchases, I'm just not going to get ahead of my board, guys, all right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have just a broader question. I mean, it seems that after a lot of these changes, you've conducted a very broad business review here. And I wondered if you might discuss the scale and the scope of those actions? And anything it may have revealed broadly about the business, its structure, its competitiveness outside of the weakness that you've obviously called out in AIS and C4 Systems and ELS. Anything you sort of learned that you intend to apply to how you want to run the company in 2013 and beyond?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, that's a very good question. It ought to be clear from the charges that in some respect we took our eye off the ball. Some of our business units performed superbly, but that benefit hasn't accrued to the benefit or that value hasn't accrued to the benefit of our shareholder, and you can better believe that we are going to be focused like a laser beam on that. I can tell you that I have -- I'm very close to our business unit presidents. I know their business. They know their business, and we are completely aligned with the prime directive. And that prime directive is drive cost out of our business, generate earnings and cash, expand our margins and reassure our shareholders that we're wise stewards of their capital. We are going to be focused on operations, and you're going to see that across every single one of our businesses. And let me tell you something else, too, as I think about our business. One of our key jobs is to manage and mitigate risk. And classical risk area argues for diversification, and one of the things that I think we need to understand about GD is we have diversification in 2 respects. First and clearly, we have diversification and countercyclicality with Aerospace and Defense businesses, right, it's pretty active manner. Second however, within our Defense businesses, we are somewhat countercyclical. With the Navy and the Army, our exposure to the Army and the offsetting exposure to the Navy portfolio. So while I see some contraction in our Army market, the Navy tends to be as a result of tactical changes in the budget. The Navy tends to be more strategically driven and vary depending on whether we are in a hot war, that balance between the Navy and the Army. So when you look at that, even within the defense portfolio, I like our balance.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's great. And just as a follow-up to that, Phebe, as you think about the portfolio, you made the comments around M&A and the deal process being broken in some fashions. As you look back over some of the deals that were done, is there the scope for portfolio transformation and divestiture at some point or is it too early to say at this point?","Phebe N. Novakovic","I'm not looking at reshaping our portfolio at the moment. I don't see any compelling reason to do that. We've reset our businesses. Some of the acquisitions that we've made, I'm not a particular fan of, and had I been consulted wouldn't have done. But that said, the teams that we've got around each of these acquisitions are well poised to do -- to perform well. They're poised to perform well. And I got a lot of confidence in these guys, I got to tell you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to follow a little bit on Carter, but turn the twist a little bit, and how are you thinking about -- well, kind of bidding and approaching market opportunities. Because the defense budget, while it's north of $500 billion, in many cases, there's great opportunities to take advantage of things you know well and Electric Boat for underseas, UAVs as an example or we saw the other day, you're looking at teaming with an aerospace company to go after a trainer. And then I have a follow-up to that.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, so, look, let's take that in several parts. What you're going to see us do is pursue -- and I can't say this enough -- pursue margin expansion and generate cash and earnings. We are not going to chase revenue. We're going to stick to our knitting and do what we know how to do. This company has a long history of operating excellence, and it's perform, perform, perform. Now that said, we've got, if you look across the portfolio, we've got some real opportunities for organic growth. And I would point you to the Marine group. When you look at the 2-per year Virginia-class, as well as the Ohio replacement program, we've got, frankly, unprecedented growth in the modern era in Marine. And that to me is again all about performance. I like where we are on Combat Systems. It's interesting that nobody has asked me this question, but I'm going to answer it anyway because I'm itching to. The story in Combat Systems over the last few years has really been about Europe. It's not about the domestic or it's not about our domestic companies. They're pretty stable. And Land Systems, the big gorilla there, is extremely stable on its vehicle orders and on its vehicle backlog, and they know how to do what they do. So I like where Combat is. I like where Marine is. Aerospace, we've got to take advantage of the growth in Aerospace, and IS&T, we've repositioned, we've reset their plans. Their backlog is stable and those guys know how to do what they're going to do. So I think we're very well-positioned to deal with any changes that we see in the defense budget because -- yes, let me tell you something, that all comes down to agility, right? What I want to know is, give us the balls and the strikes and we're going to react. Tell us what the spending is going to be, allocate any cuts across the various portfolios and then it's our job to rightsize our businesses, drive costs out and perform for our customers and our shareholders and our people.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I mean, I think that goes to sort of being careful about contracting. I mean that's -- performance is part of it, but...","Phebe N. Novakovic","Hey, you got that right. Hey, listen, if you think about GD, one of the things that we do very, very well is all about contracts. If you get bad tees and fees in a contract, you are so far behind the power curve that it takes you a long time to dig your way out of that hole. We are absolutely ruthless in our attention to our contracting. And we have got some terrific estimators and some very, very good contract people. And that is, by the way, that is the foundation that we build this business on.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I see it at M&E [ph], the development programs for the Zumwalt I guess really speak to that.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Don't they ever. That is -- that program is doing better than anyone could have expected. And I'll tell you, this is just my own little view, but when those ships hit their speed, I think they're going to have a profound impact. I'm out of my lane when I talk about that, but you know what, it's just my intuition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You talked earlier in your opening a bit about the defense cuts embedded in your guidance. Perhaps, you could give us a little bit more specificity there? And then I'm wondering if you could apply your expectations maybe a little longer term, Phebe, to the segments, particularly to Combat and IS&T, and where you think the trough is in those businesses, at least from a revenue standpoint, whether it's '13, '14, '15, how you think about that?","Phebe N. Novakovic","As I see the defense market at the moment, I think IS&T has gone through its trough. I don't see anything under my current projections that would suggest that we've got considerable revenue decline in that business. That said, as I mentioned earlier, because it's a shorter-cycle business and we've got a fair amount of O&M exposure there, they are more vulnerable and more susceptible to dramatic changes in the defense budget. But as of now, and even if I look at -- you can make some estimates about planned cuts, I think we've seen the trough. But let me move to Combat for a minute because I think understanding our order book will help you a little bit. We have anticipated a number of significant international opportunities that we are very well positioned for, but that's really all I'm going to say about that at the moment. You should see some of those opportunities drop into our backlog in the first quarter. But let's think about Combat's backlog more broadly. It's about 1.2x sales at year end, and as I look at the book-to-bill for the entire group, it's been largely increasing quarter-over-quarter in 2012. And Land Systems' book-to-bill has increased significantly, and in the fourth quarter, approached 1:1. And to give you a touch more color on that, what I'm looking at for 2013 is sales growth in the international realm of about 44%. So when I step back and say, okay, if I look at my order book, I look at my book-to-bill, I look at how I'm positioned, how our company is positioned in Land Systems, as well as some of our shorter-cycle businesses, we ought to be able to do extremely well here, and we're reflecting that in our plan. And by the way, when I say plan, I've got a '13 plan, but I see possibility for margin expansion and earnings and cash generation well into '13, '14 and '15. So we got a nice balance here.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So given the book-to-bill in '12 at Combat and the sales guidance you've got there, at what point in the year will we need to see these international orders before you'd find that solidify?","Phebe N. Novakovic","I think you ought to see them drop into our backlog in the first quarter.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on the...","Phebe N. Novakovic","By the way, I would not be leading you implicit in the guidance that I have given without a fair amount of confidence in these various orders.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, and that brings me to just the final part of the question, which is the guidance range is fairly narrow at $0.10, and just given the last couple of years, why not a slightly wider range?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Look, the way I think about this, here's kind of what we've done. We've cleaned up our business, 2013 is our reset year, and I'm going to be pretty conservative here. But don't get out ahead of me, but I'm going to be pretty conservative here and I think that's prudent. We've got some potential budget cuts coming our way. I've got -- the business unit presidents and I are aligned in taking cost out. But I'm going to stay in a fairly narrow band here, in a range that I feel comfortable in guiding you to at the moment. If I see some upside in the year, I'm going to come back at you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on that is that in the past, there's been a target for international Combat being about 40% of the total Combat Systems revenues. Do you still see that as a target?","Phebe N. Novakovic","I think we're going to be slightly in -- look, I don't have a target, I'm just telling you what I'm seeing in our pipeline and in our book-to-bill and our backlog. But I'm not -- I think it's in the -- getting approaching the mid-40s.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the bigger question is just in thinking about the different things you've said in the acquisition discipline, et cetera, is there any change in any of the incentives, and I guess the focus historically has been earnings, free cash and ROIC with respect to the charges and everything that went into '12, how do you see the real drivers and key things that you and your management team need to focus on for incentive compensation changing?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. Now listen, the issues with respect to what I consider to be a somewhat broken internal process, we will address. And you can bet your bottom dollar we're going to address it. But I want to incent this management team to do what we're telling you we're going to do. And the value proposition for GD, margin expansion, earnings and cash. Focus on the basic, perform, perform, perform. Meet our plans and deliver that value to our shareholders and our customers. Can't be any more simple than that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So when you think about just kind of maybe a big strategy question here, about how -- where the budget's going, how your portfolio is positioned, you yourself having been in O&B [ph] and knowing how downturns go. I mean, how is that flavoring, if you will or coloring how you think about the portfolio, how you think about the business? And when I think about General Dynamics 3 years from now, 4 years from now, and you've been in that seat for a while, I mean, what do I have to look forward to? Can you give me some color on that, think strategy?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Look, I'm going to focus on operations in '13 and we're going to continue to do what we are capable of doing on the operations side. And I think you couple that, that discipline that we've had and we're capable of, with very prudent and shareholder-friendly capital deployment. Hey, listen, one of the things that we need to do is reassure our investors that we are wise stewards of their capital, and we will intend to do that. So I will be very cautious going forward, shareholder-friendly, continue to perform, focus on our customers and our people and lead this -- it's interesting, you both lead and serve the management team and the company, and I got to tell you, we are a very, very tight, cohesive management team. And I've got an awful lot of confidence in them.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can I ask one follow-on as a part of that? Besides the operations, and that's kind of clear and you talked a lot about that, but strategically what do you see as your biggest challenge ahead of you?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, strategically, what we need to do is manage Defense, the Defense businesses in a slightly -- in a down market or in a declining market. And in my mind, we ought to be able to make money. In fact, we should make money as a good cyclical in a down market. And what does that mean? It means that you stay focused on the things that I talked about and that you perform agilely. You've got to be agile. You've got to be able to react quickly to the balls and strikes that come your way. It's all about agility and it's -- that's what a good cyclical does. It's what we're going to do. So I look at that as a challenge, and the opportunity is to take advantage of the growth where we've got it. And that's clear at Gulfstream and in parts of our other businesses where we're going to have organic growth. Did that answer your question?","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, yes, I think so. I mean, I guess the question is, how about parts of the business where you don't have growth, what do you do with those?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Then you're going to drive for earnings and cash, aren't you? I mean, there is no point chasing revenue or pretending that one is in a growth market when you're not. I think what you want from us is realism, putting the mirror up to our face and saying, here's what we see. And based on what we see, delivering on our promises.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A question regarding Combat Systems again back, but in particular in the backlog. You saw a 10% drop in the kind of the funded backlog, maybe you could just give us a little color exactly what the moving pieces were there. And back focusing on I guess the international piece. At the end of 3Q, 42% of the mix was tied to the wheeled vehicle area in terms of the portfolio. What gives you kind of the confidence that -- is it the indigenous manufacturing aspect of kind of where these operations are that you're going to continue to sustain that or we're not going to be hit with what I think could be some choppiness as you've kind of indicated?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Look, the vehicle -- let's talk about Land Systems. The vehicle market is year-over-year from '12 to '13, our vehicle line of business. That's both tracked and wheeled is essentially flat. And it's a mix of domestic production and international. And I think we have, in fact, we have reflected declines in our decreases in our domestic Army customer's requirements. And we're balancing those with international orders. It's just that simple, and that business -- so given that balance and given what they've got in their backlog and given what you're likely to see in the first quarter in terms of additional backlog, I like that balance. I think that's a diversified and frankly, risk-adjusted portfolio.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just I guess what I was alluding to was more the timing aspect. So the orders coming through for the first quarter that you kind of basically sounds like you can already see kind of offsets that, the pressure that we kind of already understood on the domestic side?","Phebe N. Novakovic","That's right.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I think you mentioned earlier that the defense outlook you have is based on the full year CR. Now it looks as though the budget for 2013 could be a bit smaller than the CR. How should we think about what happens if that budget does get passed? And then also, it does seem as though the potential of sequestration could hit may be increasing, how are you thinking about that today?","Phebe N. Novakovic","The budget that we see for '13, we have factored into our plan. And we can sustain within the current planning cuts across the portfolio. If they get at the level of sequestration or some of sequestration and I take a look at '13 and '14 and the need to come back and rebalance and reassess our guidance, I will. But I got to tell you, even if we've got pretty significant cuts in '13, we have seen very, very little impact as I walk through each of my businesses on the defense side. So absent some, as I mentioned earlier, draconian cuts, we're going to be all right in '13.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Jason Gursky of Citigroup.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to just focus on Gulfstream for a minute, and get a sense of the current demand in the marketplace. Both on what you would describe at your lower end, as well as the higher end and maybe just walk us around the world on how demand is shaping up and really specifically maybe give us a sense of where we are from a backlog perspective in number of months, particularly for your large cabin aircraft x G650?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Let me preface my answer with giving you some details about our production rates. We're planning 139 green deliveries, 113 large cabin and 26 mid-cabin. And to my point earlier about the rebaselining of completions and manufacturing, we're going to -- our fly rates reflect about a 50% increase in outfitted deliveries. So look, what does that tell you? If you know us, what you know is that we have historically used our production rates to adjust with respect to our -- reflecting our backlog. And that's exactly what we've done here. Everything that I see in the backlog, as well as in our current pipeline, makes me very comfortable with those production rates. We still have demand for our 450, 550, 650, the 280 is coming on strong. And we are well-positioned this year. As I told you, the issue here is at this moment not about our production rates. And look, if you know us, and you know us over time, and you've watched us over time, if we see a -- if something happens and some exogenous factor happens in the overall economy, we will adjust our production rates and we'll come back at you. But I'm not seeing that at the moment. This is very realistic and doable.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just specifically on kind of regional demand and how it's shaping up?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, so interestingly, the largest demand we saw was in our -- was within the Fortune 500 as they're replenishing their fleet. And then I think if you think about the demographics across our portfolio, Asia was down, not surprisingly. And regarding the details about who makes up what percentage, approximately 30% were from individuals, 30% from private and 40% from public companies. But one of the things, again, I like about that backlog and our order book is that it's balanced. We've got North America, we've got Europe, we've got Middle East, Asia. And they tend to ebb and flow somewhat countercyclically. So the good -- one of the very good things that I see is that the Fortune 500s are back into the market.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you for joining our call today.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call.","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus.","Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $243 million, or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase. This quarter's operating earnings of $1.034 billion reflects 12.9% operating margin, consistent with the 12.9% operating margin of third quarter 2014.","By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.","Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million, or 1.4%, operating earnings are down $47 million, and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our Cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter are rather similar.","On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase. Operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase. And operating margins are up 80 basis points, once again, reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations.","With respect to cash, we had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter; that is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations.","You may recall that we received significant advance payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders the year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next as we have previously advised you.","We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles in pre-production buildup of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic.","In the quarter, we repurchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow. To help you size that, we have spent $3.380 billion on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.57 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter.","As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group where we have received several multi-year orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company of $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter.","Let me say a few words about each of our businesses, business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margin are all up from the year-ago quarter, as well as for the first nine months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million, or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest-ever revenue quarter.","Operating earnings increased $15 million, or 3.6%, to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20-basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million.","On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half, but was nevertheless better than our expectations in guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9 to 1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive with the G650 and G650ER leading the way. Only four of the orders were for models not yet in production.","Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America-focused with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders from China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good, so we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter.","Next Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter, with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million, and a really strong 16.2% operating margin. However, margins are off somewhat against the third quarter 2014, when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014; operating earnings are up $57 million, or 9.6%; and operating margin is at 15.7%, up 130 basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year.","The Marine group's revenue is higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first nine months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date revenue has increased by $759 million, or 14.4%, to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering, and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activity. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group.","Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a one-time charge at NASSCO on a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first nine months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter.","And finally IS&T. They continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.2 billion is off $28 million against last year's quarter, but up $113 million, or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year, and instead, we are up almost 2%.","Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million, or 8.4%, compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90-basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on 130-basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected.","So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate, and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9.","I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more details.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period.","As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue was held steady over the first nine months compared with last year, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date. As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we'd expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story.","Moving onto interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million.","At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about break even, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter. And that change, again, is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter.","Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, reflecting our favorable performance to date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%.","We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million.","Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.","Nicole, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Phebe, thanks for the additional detail and color in your opening remarks. It's very helpful. I just had one quick follow-up question though on some of the comments that you made around the book-to-bill. At Gulfstream, with regard to value versus units, it sounds like the number of units were a little bit better than the value. And then you followed on with some positive commentary about the G650. So wondering if you could dive in a little bit more about the difference between the two and what that might say about the pricing environment that you're seeing today for particularly the G450 and G550.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it was largely the difference between the two book-to-bill calculations is really about mix, and let me give you, let me take this opportunity, I think, to give you a little bit of color and detail and I'll parse for you sort of the demand picture, because I think I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year. And I think this context is important.","First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This was our strongest third order intake in the last four years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we had in seven years last quarter. Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from ex-U.S., Asia, Pacific Rim, Australia, Latin America, Mideast. So nice broad order interest and order activity. Third our book-to-bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for three years.","So what does that mean? It means that the backlog has been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contract terms, so they're rather sticky.","So let me give you a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good, as it's been all year. And if you're interested in the piece parts constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American which is wholesome. Public, private companies, high net worth individuals. And these are sophisticated buyers, who're interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. So I think as context, that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing.","Now, with all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We had a competitor with white tails in the G450 and G550 space at very low prices. There are also five to six pre-owned G550s on the market that are less than five years old. And these newer planes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offerings. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic.","I think I gave you a little bit more there, but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market, because I think it's important to see it in its totality.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Phebe, you talked about the disconnect between cash generation and cash deployment. And consistently in the past it's been 100% of conversion. And you teed up the 2015 and 2016 explanation thereof. So I'm just curious: how much of the deployment this year \u2013 I think that you said somewhere around $3.3 billion year-to-date \u2013 is deployed and presumably there'd be more of that in the fourth quarter. How much of that is indicative of what you think free cash flow is once you get through this kind of negative headwind you're seeing in 2015 and 2016? Is that the underlying cash generative base of business that you see out in the 2017, 2018 period of time?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, to the extent that I think that can fully understand your question, we will give you more color on 2016, as we always do, in January of that year. But I'll try to give you some context for 2015 and 2016 and not beyond that, what we see in terms of the cash headwinds. We have those international deposits that we're deploying, as you would expect. And we're building our operating working capital, also as you would expect if you think about it at Gulfstream. So that all flushes out at the end of 2016. So if the essence of your question is there any structural cash generation issue at our company, the answer is no (17:37).","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","By 2017 you see it largely resolved back to the kind of the GD of old, the 100% conversion?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just a clarification. Jason, the tax rate contribution of $0.20 was how much of the raise?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So it was $0.05 impact in the quarter. And as I mentioned, I think we're expecting closer to 28% tax rate for the year. So you can do the math on what that does to the fourth quarter.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick one on IS&T. Obviously, the results there have been much better than you expected. I wondered if you might give us some color on where you're seeing the strength and break out the more traditional service-oriented offerings versus the product-oriented offerings. And maybe comment on the cost structure and your efforts there and what impact that's having. Just a little bit more color on the successes you've been having there.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so this is a good news story for us. And it's across both Mission Systems and Information Technology. They both had a strong quarter, and they're improving their performance year-to-date. And there is no single area that's driving strength, given the number of programs that we have in that portfolio. There is just constant flux in mix and timing. They have been, but because of their decreased cost structure, they've been winning more than their fair share. So that has added nicely to our book-to-bill which I think year-to-date is about 1-to-1. And those short cycle businesses, that's pretty impressive. So I think it's operating excellence, technical ability, and just focus. So we're very pleased with what they've done.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Phebe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I wanted to get back to Gulfstream. And just two things to understand. One, you've talked in the past about potentially moving forward some G650 production, perhaps adding some in the nearer-term which would help the revenue top-line. Can you comment on that? And then also, where does availability stand on the G450 and G550 now in terms of months ahead?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me take them in the inverse order. The G450 and G550 are about three to four quarters. So not much of a change there. With respect to the G650, our production is as we anticipated this year. So no changes to that. But going forward, as we prepare our plan for next year, we'll look to feather in a couple of, and I'm talking about one and two, just a handful \u2013 onesies and twosies \u2013 feather in some G650s to help offset as we make that transition to entering into service on the new airplane. So that's pretty much what we've been seeing all year and saying is exactly what we're continuing to see.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So Phebe, if you could give us some color on how the flight test program is going, because it's kind of hard to follow as an outsider. What milestones are happening? And if you could just kind of paint a picture for that.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So our flight test program is going very well. On the G550 we have surpassed G500. We've surpassed more than 100 hours of flight, and we've successfully completed about, I think, 45 missions. On the G600, we've begun construction and is well underway on construction on the test aircraft. And we plan to fly that in 2016. And our entry into service remains unchanged. So going very, very well.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just as a quick follow-on, is there any chance that, that entry into service could happen a little earlier if kind of everything just continues to go smooth?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's hard to predict since we don't, but I'm not going to get out ahead of Gulfstream. We're sticking right now to what our original entry into service is. And as we go and we mature and get down the test flight program, we'll have a little bit more clarity. But right now that's what we still see.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Arment (22:47) with Sterne Agee. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Yes. Good morning, Phebe.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Unknown Speaker","Can you give us an update on your general thoughts of the latest talk on the budget deal, if there's any material impact in terms of your overall plan and just regarding, in particular, regarding Combat? It seems like the mix there continues to favor the margin performance. If you could just update how we see the mix going forward. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the budget \u2013 the prospective budget, agreement would be very welcome news I think from a national security perspective. And certainly for us our programs are fully funded in the President's request and as we understand the proposed budget agreement. So I think that's some very, very good progress made quickly. So we're pleased with that and we would encourage and hope that, that continues since \u2013 we're hopeful that, that's all on track.","And on Combat, we are continuing. It's between, last year and this year, we've had some mix issues as we came off of mature programs that were in development and at the end of their production runs and started up on a whole series of new programs. But that backlog, and that coupled with the operating excellence of that entire group, positions us quite well for nice earnings growth. And margins should increase over time.","If you think about that business as we've got our platform businesses, but we also have our Ordnance and Tactical Systems business. And they had an absolutely terrific quarter. So they are highly focused on their cost structure, operating leverage, and they had a very wholesome book-to-bill in excess of 1-to-1. So for a short cycle business that's very, very good.","Unknown Speaker","Appreciate it. Thank you, Phebe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. I wanted to go back to Marine and the strength there. You talked about it before \u2013 submarine driven. Is this a sustainable revenue rate quarterly, Phebe, as we go forward here? It sounds like...","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, think about the submarines in two ways. We're at our \u2013 this will be steady state on Virginia Block IV revenues. So what we're seeing now will continue. And we will continue to see and anticipate growth in the Ohio Replacement design work, which has been growing at a very healthy clip. And the growth will slow down but it will continue to grow. So that business is very well positioned for additional revenue increases.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And you see the margins coming back up into the 9%s?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I do.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I wanted to ask Myles' question again maybe from a different direction. The buy-back and the dividends exceeding free cash flow this year, do you think that's something that we should expect again next year? And do you have a sort of leverage target in mind? You've gone back to sort of net debt to cash of basically zero. But do you see it actually moving to a net debt situation going forward?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I think one way to think about it is we would never view a net cash position as being optimal and even a break even situation is not optimal. I don't necessarily think we'd characterize as having a target leverage position. So much as we think about having the preservation of the strong balance sheet that allows us to be poised to quickly and readily take a strategic direction when the opportunity presents itself. And as far as capital deployment goes, I'll look at my boss and say I'm not going to speak to our plans for next year and get out ahead of her. But you know where we are today is trying to normalize that deployment of capital to a net income level given that we see free cash flow being somewhat less than net income this year.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And maybe a quick follow up, Jason, as well. On the foreign exchange you mentioned this is something we should watch. What's your hedging situation? Do you have most of these export revenues hedged?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So yeah, two parts to answer that question: from the perspective of actual economic exposure in having a foreign currency revenue or expense item in a particular business, we have about 100% hedged and we're totally secure on that front. What I'm referring to strictly is the translation of our indigenous businesses in Spain, in the U.K., in Canada and so on translating those operating results back into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. So it's not an economic loss we're talking about. It's a headwind from a U.S. consolidated reporting perspective. But from an actual economic exposure standpoint we're very comfortably hedged.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So I think some of the wait times, if not all of them by your aircraft platform at Gulfstream actually increased a little bit last quarter including G450 and G550, both the CBs. You've indicated there is some headwinds there in that market right now \u2013 call it cross winds, if you will, from obviously a competitor. The question is have you actually scaled back on G450 production at all this year as it relates to the next couple of years of rate? And can you remind us what the wait time is for the G650 right now? Thanks a lot.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So our production for this year is exactly on track. No changes. We're in the process of setting our production rates for next year and we'll give you that color when we report fourth quarter and give you guidance. And the G650 actually, we are one or two slots away from moving to a second quarter of 2018 availability. So that backlog, as wholesome as it is, continues to grow.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I want to go back to the same question I guess in terms of the free cash flow. I guess I'm just trying to think about when you first came in, Phebe, you talked about the M&A organization as being broken and needed to be fixed. And I guess I'm wondering why we haven't seen you make more actions there? Is it the budget outlook? Is it the prices? Is it that you see more value in the stock? Just what would make you change your view towards buyback and start thinking about acquisition?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, so far, we've seen nothing to particular note that's interesting at accretive prices. So I think that's the best way to think about it. We're really not looking because there isn't much out there, from our perspective. So we just continue to keep our powder dry and you'll continue to see us through the course of the year buy back shares as it makes sense tactically.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And if I can follow up, is there any way you can size the warranty issue at NASSCO?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. It had to do with a bearing on a drive shaft. And that's to the extent of which I understand the shipbuilding challenge there. But we took the warranty and NASSCO is, we took the charge and NASSCO is all set to, it is poised to recover for next quarter. So that was a one-time event, and it's in our rear view mirror.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Hi, Phebe.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","It'll be a little bit like trying to pull teeth here, but we'll see if I can succeed. Your outlook for Gulfstream. They've continued to surprise you, and yet you're being conservative about the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more on some of the challenges? Is it higher R&D? Is it mix? Is it something else that causes you some concern about profitability?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the fourth quarter is going to be lighter than the third quarter. And let me take you back to last quarter when we talked about Jet Aviation and that we were going to see some margin compression in the second half as we began to spend on engineering in the pre-production activities at Basel that we need to do in anticipation of the start of production which begins early next year. That has happened and it will continue into next quarter. So couple that with you've got a higher R&D and lower launch assistance. And that's essentially the story from where we sit right now.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Did you pull any teeth?","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","No, I'm not going to try too hard because you've been pretty consistent and doing a reasonable job there.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Phebe, I'm going to try and follow on to Howard's question. For the margin at Gulfstream to only be 18.5% for the year, it requires the fourth quarter to be down like 16.5% or something. Why would it get that low?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as I told you, we're seeing a significant margin compression at Jet. And I think that if you back in the math, it's fourth quarter, maybe somewhere around 18%. Yeah. So Jet is a factor. Our R&D spend is going to be higher. There's really nothing other than that. There's nothing structural, if that's what you're getting at.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","What's R&D going be relative to the third quarter?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Up.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. I'm sure you won't quantify it, but I'll let you go with that. Thanks.","Phebe N.

Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Phebe, on the G500 could you talk about order interest there, ex the initial fleet buyers that came in for that airplane when you announced it? And then one question about your comments on free cash flow conversion as we head into next year. Are you assuming that advances we see a further draw down on the advances side into 2016? Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, on your latter question. And on the G500 and G600, customer interest has been good. And we expect that interest and demand increase as we progress through the development program and we, frankly, get closer to EIS. So this is an attractive airplane set for our customers.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Phebe, just looking at Combat just given the strong order flow over there the past 18 months or so and the FX pressure that you're seeing this year, what's the growth for that segment look like next year? Some of the international contracts flowing through but just being offset by FX and does that annualize next year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as you would expect, we took in a large number of orders into the backlog in 2014 and if you look at the engineering cycle and typically when programs start production, you could reasonably expect that production to begin in 2016 and I think we've been pretty clear about that. But I don't want to get into any more detail on what 2016 looks like until we finish our plan.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. Notwithstanding what you just said about not getting into 2016, I was wondering if you could comment on how the profitability headwind from Jet carries over for \u2013 in Aerospace from Jet Aviation \u2013 carries over from Q4 into 2016 since you've got some pretty tough margin comps in the first half of the year? The Gulfstream margin was around 20%. And I thought that the cost management in Aerospace was one of the ways to help manage this transition from the G550, G450 to the G500, G600?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, your supposition is right. Cost management is going to be key. The margin compression that we've seen in Jet reverses in the first quarter of 2016 as they begin production. Right now, they're simply in the dueling phase and engineering for these large body and narrow body airline completions. So that's a fair amount of engineering work. We'll get into production then starting in the first quarter of next year.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So that headwind is behind us.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","And Nicole, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you.

Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, Phebe, there was some press during the quarter about Bath on the DDG-1000. Could you give us your thoughts on that program? Just how it's going and if there's any financial risk going forward related to that?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so let me talk a little bit about DDG-1000. As we've said before this is a highly complex and revolutionary surface combatant. The first of which \u2013 we've got three in our backlog and three under construction \u2013 the first of which is nearing C trial. So we are continuing to work with the Navy to resolve O&E developmental issues that they see. And I think we all agree that we're working through all of those technical challenges on this first ship.","And by the way, I think the bellwether that we used to think about performance on that ship is, you may recall that the complete redesign of the deckhouse on the third ship was reassigned to us, that design is nearly complete and construction is proceeding quite nicely. So that suggests considerable learning and I'm very pleased with at least that performance there.","We do have some risks going forward. We'll manage that accordingly. We're working very closely with the Navy and Navy's other subcontractors on this program. But let me give you some sense of magnitude: Bath is 1\/32nd of our sales so we are paying quite a bit of attention to what is a complex warship, but I think the context is important here.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thanks so much.","Phebe N.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning and thank you Howard. We enjoyed a solid fourth quarter, the results in comparisons with prior period were straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions.","I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful. So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share.","This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete, $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of a 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4, 2017. EPF was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million.","Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and a somewhat lower share count.","For all-in-all, a solid quarter, with good performance, particularly compared to the year ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This is also $0.09 above consensus.","Revenue was $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basics, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up $221 million or 5.2% over 2017.","Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $166 above 2017. All-in-all, 2018 was a very good year. A year of growth and a year of important order intake that left the company well-positioned for 2019.","I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations, and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018.","So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable both in large part to the delivery of nine G500 in the quarter, and also a strong fourth quarter in the service centers.","For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million, or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream, and cost attendant to the introduction of the G500.","This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18% leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more than forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, and $1.49 billion of operating earnings.","All-in-all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year. On the order front, activity in the quarter was good and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill in Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8 to $1 denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release.","We expect the G600 to be certified this year, although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half. The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver in the sales. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that had gone dormant with the far filing of the NORDAM bankruptcy proceedings.","That has impacted right in our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses, and our ability to provide in the south to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well.","Next, Combat Systems, Combat revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $251 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%.","Operating earnings of $952 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecasts we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenue than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017.","We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 and came in at $962, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of a vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter.","We continue to see nice order activity in this group, but fourth quarter orders of $2.19 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.3 to 1 in the quarter and 1 to 1 for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of a billion. We also continue to have significant international opportunities particularly in Europe. We\u2019ve been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for Piranha vehicles.","And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in a key market. FWW will become part of European land systems.","In our U.S. market, our army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our Combat vehicles and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity.","Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment.","By the way, the sequential comparison equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $751 million were up $76 million over 11% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin.","At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $735 to $745. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 outperformed our forecasts by $16 million to $26 million.","In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all three of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis at electric boat to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic missile submarine.","As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity. As you know, we have also increased our internal training program as well as our public private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trade.","At $243 million CapEx in 2018 from Marine was more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect a Marine segment to command a larger share of our capital budget as we work towards satisfying the nation\u2019s need for its critical naval systems.","So far suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers and increase the size of the fleet. As you are aware, the information systems technology group have been realigned and reshaped into two separate segments.","Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, a leading providers of Information Solutions to the federal government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018, by the acquisition of CSRA.","I\u2019m going to ask Jason to interject from comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful.","Jason Aiken","On that note, let me make some comments about GDIT and Mission System\u2019s performance in 2018. We originally guided to full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately one billion 30 million.","If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT excluding CSRA did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales, so in line with our expectations and that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT notwithstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year.","From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1.50 billion on a combined basis, so somewhat better than we had expected. So all-in-all a solid year for both businesses.","As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolios shaping our activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of a commercial health products business, CSRAs SETA business, and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the group's focus on high-end solutions and high-value added customer needs.","Phebe Novakovic","So let\u2019s first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include CSRA, comparison to the year ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points, evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here.","For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin, once again annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA.","Next, Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin.","For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin driven in part by mix.","Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above 1 times till the end of the year with the modestly higher backlog at 5.3 billion. So on this call last year on a company wide basis, our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of 32.35 billion to 32.45 billion. Operating earnings of 4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. And as you know, we wound up with $36.2 billion on an organic basis, but on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast.","At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11 and came in at $11.22 including, the transaction costs related to CSRA, which are about $0.20 [ph] per share. So let me provide our forecast for 2019, initially by business group and then on a companywide roll out.","In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, up more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of the mix shift as well as a modest increase in pre-owned sales, which again generally carry no margin.","The revenue will be back-end loaded as well as the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue progression will look something like $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Operating margin in the first two quarters should be in the mid 14 area, strengthening in Q3 and moving to well over 17 in Q4.","We believe that last year will be the low point in operating earnings during this transition to our new models with modest earnings increase in 2019 and 2020, and significant earnings traction thereafter. In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings of $965 to $975 slightly better than last year.","Here again, look for both the revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abrams and sudden demand for Stryker vehicles and munitions.","We see domestic volume expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate of around 8.5%.","We anticipate growth in each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long term growth with an expanding need for submarines, surface combat, and support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate.","We expect information technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range, a slight improvement over 2018s performance. To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and SETA businesses, which represented just over a billion of prior year revenues.","We see the business making excellent progress towards optimizing the acquisition as we combine teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increase our value proposition to diverse, defense, Intel and federal civilian agencies.","For Mission Systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyber and space-related markets with fairly steady top line in our core tactical network incumbency.","We are anticipating operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the mid, between mid and high 30s, once again building throughout the year. So for 2019, company-wide all of this roll up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue up by 6% over 2018.","Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share. I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low 18% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises.","So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year\u2019s results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that, and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year could represent about one third of our EPS.","So now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash backlog and other items and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Phebe Novakovic","Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million bringing the interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year, and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our Mid-A credit rating.","We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018.","Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year in line with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low 18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018, but recall in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform, and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points.","Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December, by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion.","Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions as we did in December.","Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We\u2019ve also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year. That\u2019s up 60% from 2017, as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace.","For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia Class program. Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200% bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and this is below our typical 100% conversion target.","If you\u2019re following the headlines out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we\u2019ve experienced payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue and we expect to receive the delayed payment this year. Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect the cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019 and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong in our typical 90% to 100% range.","And one last point on backlog, we ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that\u2019s up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems Group.","Beyond the firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which includes options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multi-billion dollar CHS-5 IDIQ award admissions systems.","In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multi-year airplane, multi-year order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead.","Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Howard Rubel","Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we asked participants ask one question and one follow up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Nicole, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Morning David.","David Strauss","Phebe, can you, can you give us a little bit more detail on the on the IT guide. I understand, with the divestitures, you know that\u2019s a headwind on the top line, but you have one additional quarter of CSRA and in terms of the margin guide, I would have thought, we would have seen some margin improvement here given what\u2019s going on with intangible, amortization and additional synergies? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","So let\u2019s talk a little bit about this business. In a growing environment last year, they had a one-to-one book-to-bill. They also have a 75% win rate and a $26 billion pipeline. This management team is performing the cost synergies beautifully, and frankly is a bit of ahead of schedule. By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative, management team that is really making GDIT into a workplace of preference.","And in this market, people are absolutely critical and important across the board. But, people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% percent of net income in cash and we\u2019ll continue that this year and for the years to come.","So, so what we see this year? Despite that large backlog -- despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing, when the contracts move from the backlog into sales. And you\u2019ll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year.","This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog, into our sale. That also is impacting the margin rate. So I\u2019m very confident in the ability of this business to perform than outperform their cost synergy. They are growing great cash performance, so in the instance right now, it\u2019s simply a question of timing.","Jason Aiken","And Dave, if you want me to, I\u2019ll add a little bit of additional color around your influence on margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group. If you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that\u2019s a couple of hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year ago 2017 full year rate. That\u2019s really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins on the core business, excluding at amortization benefit.","Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures were nominally up, let\u2019s just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have four full quarters of amortization versus a flattish to slightly nose knows up total top line is actually perhaps counter intuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It will start to accelerate for the following year once we have a full up year-on-year comparison.","So if you think about amortization, is really call it a 20 \u2013 I\u2019ll call the 20ish basis point drag. The other part of it is -- is we do have synergies as Phebe mentioned that are accelerating, so I\u2019d call that maybe an 80 basis point to 90 basis point assist, as we go forward and we\u2019ll continue to accelerate after that.","And then from a mix perspective issue alluded to, when we talked about this for some time after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it 100 basis point to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So call it 50 basis points or so from that.","So, if you take the 20ish basis points on amortization, if you call it 50 basis points on mix offset by a positive 80 basis point to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get call it 10 basis point to 20 basis point that improvement for the year, and we would see it accelerating after that. So, hopefully that color is helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the Aerospace demand environment. This was the basing concerns out there about the global economy and whether that's had any flow-through to customer demand for your product in the last three months. Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","So I may pass that for you. Our North American demand is robust and growing. Western Europe is been -- it\u2019s been very active for us translating into addition to orders as well as considerable activity in our pipeline. I would say some of the emerging markets are a little bit more cautious. They tend to be focused on the 650 and on new products, but overall very very nice, very nice demand and interest in North America and Western Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein","Yes. Good morning. Another maybe follow up question quickly on Aerospace. When you compare this release to your last release last quarter, and you\u2019ll get the estimated potential contract value, it went up by almost a billion. Can you help us understand what that means and what gets thrown in that pile and why it would go up by a billion?","Phebe Novakovic","Well let me ask Jason, to give you a little color on that.","Jason Aiken","So Ron, one of the last comments that I made was around this area and it typically in the estimated potential contract value bucket for the defense businesses. That\u2019s clearly contract options and IDIQ potential value. For Aerospace, it holds a number of items to include options for aircraft as well as longer term arrangements that we have with individual customers. So where deliveries may be further out in the delivery queue and spread out in the backlog.","So as I mentioned, we did have in the fourth quarter, a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer it was valued at just over a billion dollars. It\u2019s a multi aircraft, multi-year arrangement that spans out over several years that did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customer\u2019s board approval coming up later this quarter.","So we expect that to happen this quarter, and we\u2019ll move into the firm backlog, and be counted as traditional orders at the time. But given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that\u2019s why we put it in the as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in the firm backlog till we till we get to that firm order.","Ronald Epstein","Okay great. And if I may do one follow up for Phebe. When you think about the current political environment and what that means for defense spending, and then how do you pass through that? It seems like there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty and volatility going on. So you know in your experience, how do you think about it?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, some of the political contretemps haven\u2019t necessarily affected their defense spending if and in fact, defense spending has been increasing in this environment. So we are quite comfortable that we\u2019re going to see through our at least initial planning horizon, very nice funding for all of our key programs. So I haven\u2019t seen too much perturbation as a result of some of the extant issues with respect to the overall budget impacting defense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning Phebe or Jason. I wanted to see if we could dig a little bit more into the margin pressure you expect in the front end of 2019 and what you saw on the back end of 2018. How do we pass the pressure between the completion issues Phebe that you cited at Jet Aviation, just the general learning curve and conversions you\u2019re doing on five hundreds and six hundreds, and specifically NORDAM. Where does NORDAM factor into this, and how quickly do you get a lift as that problem diminishes?","Phebe Novakovic","So let\u2019s take it in reverse order. We\u2019ve got on Nacelle line well under control, the cost performance has been quite good. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ve had to spool back up the supply chain. That is the pacing item with respect to our timing of our deliveries, but the supply chain is doing well and it\u2019s just going to take them a while to begin to have the capacity and the throughput and product to feed our demand.","So I will see a little bit of slowness on that on the delivery in the south. But as we get into the second half, that will have completely resolved and we will be in full rate production throughout the supply chain. So we\u2019re quite pleased with that. The margin compression it has been something we\u2019ve been talking to you all for some time about. As you all know, the first lot of airplanes in this case, we\u2019re talking about the G500 carried very little margin. Those airplanes will ramp up, continue to ramp up that production and first quarter, second quarter as we move from that initial lot to carry those lower margins and you\u2019ll see some, we will see some margin expansion on that line. The 600 will come in at slightly higher entry margins, simply because of the disproportionate amount of test cost and on deep costs borne by the 500. And then we\u2019ll nicely come down its learning curve.","So those are some of the issues that we would see with respect to the margins. The completion business, the jet we had a problem this year on really on the operating side. We have fixed that, and going forward, we\u2019re comfortable that they will do better this year.","Robert Spingarn","So Jet is not really not part of the 2019 pressure?","Phebe Novakovic","No, [Indiscernible]. No they\u2019re not. They will do better this year because of the affirmative and proactive steps they took in 2018. So you think -- much about mix.","Robert Spingarn","Once you\u2019re through this year, do you recover to the old margins at Aerospace?","Phebe Novakovic","We\u2019ll have, as we continue to come down on a learning curve. We finish up a lot of the 500, the first lot of 500 airplanes, the first flight of 600 airplanes; you can expect us to come quickly down our learning curve. And I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ll see some earnings and margin expansion in 2020 and then really quite nice expansion and considerable earnings growth thereafter, as we have completed all of those two transitions. So I\u2019m not going to predict exactly where we end up on new airplanes with respect to terminal margins here. But, you should expect us to continue the strong operating performance you have seen from us. We know how to build these airplanes, low cost high, quality provider. We're good at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we could get some color on that Canadian Lab program that was weighing on the conversion this year, and you probably had maybe a billion of revenue on that program. I\u2019m curious, are you getting, are you getting any cash on the program an ongoing basis, and what would the conversion have looked like if not for the progress delays?","Phebe Novakovic","So let me give you some context here Myles. This is a valid contract that all parties to that contract have repeatedly and recently attested to their commitment to honor that contract. The Canadian government fully understands the importance of our high end manufacturing and engineering talent in London, Ontario and the robust supply chain that we have throughout the country.","Our payment issue got caught up in a larger international political issue diplomatic issue. That's why we got some payment last year. Those diplomatic contretemps affected, that slowed the payment that they would otherwise have anticipated. So that will resolve. It\u2019s a timing issue, and we\u2019re quite comfortable and quite confident that that will resolve just at a slower rate than we had anticipated.","Myles Walton","In just about a breadbox around it, Jason would you have been above 90% adjusted for pension conversion if you get this?","Jason Aiken","That\u2019s correct. We would have then call it net 95%, 200% range we\u2019ve been targeting.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. Phebe, I wanted to ask on Gulfstream. I thought, you\u2019d implied in the third quarter that the book-to-bill would get close to one. So if you just comment on what might have happened, so since we wound up somewhat less than that?","Phebe Novakovic","I believe George what I said was that the orders would be better in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter. In fact, they were. And you know the book-to-bill was nice particularly I think. But when you look at the addition of delivery, a considerable number of additional deliveries that we added in the fourth quarter. But you know the quarterly book-to-bill, if you go back and looked at Gulfstream, Aerospace tends to have some lumpiness that we had very nice order activity last year, and the fourth quarter was about what we anticipated the orders would be better than the third quarter.","And I would also point out that we\u2019ve got a, Jason talked about at some length, a billion dollar order with a customer that once it gets cleared by its board, moves into backlog. So I consider that, we had a good -- we had a good order quarter.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just could you quantify at all how much the incremental costs at NORDAM may have impacted the margin in the quarter?","Phebe Novakovic","Now that\u2019s almost impossible to deconstruct. I\u2019m very pleased with how quickly we\u2019ve got some really good operators in Tulsa. And I\u2019m really pleased at how quickly they were able to stabilize the line. We\u2019ve got good performance, good cost control. And frankly, we\u2019ve got now aligned supply chain. Though, I don\u2019t know the any particular impact of that in with any specificity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning all.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Phebe, just given where we are in the life cycle of the 650, I know historically you\u2019ve given us sort of a framework and how you think about products and their lifecycle and we just got the seventh anniversary of entry and a service on the 650. So I think we\u2019ll be halfway through that kind of 15 year life cycle that you usually reference in the next couple of quarters, and I wondered if you could just kind of update us on how you think about the lifecycle of that particular product as we look forward in this year.","Phebe Novakovic","So I am -- as you can well imagine, not about comment on what our thinking is about new product introductions, but you can imagine that our pea-shooter is full, that\u2019s the way you ought to think about it.","Carter Copeland","Okay, then I\u2019ll try another one. Jason, the comment on CapEx, just as we think about cash flow. When -- when do you see the Marine? I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if you can answer this yeah just based on the planning. But, when should we think that the CapEx build in Marine sort of levels off from a longer term standpoint. Is that still a couple of years away?","Jason Aiken","It is, its call it over the next couple of years two, between two and three years and then you\u2019ll see that tail back to a more normal level. So as I mentioned, over the more intermediate planning horizon, we do continue to see that. I think more reliable 90 to 90% to 100% cash conversion rate as a result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes thank you very much. So, Phebe, I believe Mark Burns who runs a Gulfstream has said at some point you\u2019ll have a competitor to the global 70 500 in the market. And you obviously have an opportunity back where the 450 was. And, you obviously have probably taken a little bit longer than you expected on certifying the G600.","So if we think about R&D, was that high in the fourth quarter -- higher -- high relatively high in the fourth quarter, and you know what, what comment can you give us in terms of what sort of a drag that will be on 2019?","Phebe Novakovic","So let me just gently tease you a bit about not trafficking in what I call rumor intelligence or not. So with that cautionary note, our certification has come along quite nicely. As I told you, it\u2019s a little slower than we anticipated. You know this is a -- this is a detailed and appropriately robust process that unfortunately got impacted by the shut down and I apologize for my early optimism, but originally, in plan, our internal plan was first quarter and we think that, that because of that perturbations of the shutdown that\u2019s going to move into the second quarter. Jason will talk about the R&D.","Jason Aiken","Yeah. Cai, the R&D for the quarter was essentially flat year-over-year. It was up a little bit sequentially from the third quarter if you go back and look at that data, call it by a roughly $20 million or so. I think for the year we ended up right around 1.5% of sales for total Company-sponsored R&D. So I don\u2019t think high or low in any anomalous way, and I think we expect to see, as we have in the past, a continued steady drip, and Phebe alluded to it on R&D, as we continue to -- the pipeline of new product introductions and technology introductions. So I don\u2019t think anything anomalous up or down.","Cai von Rumohr","Got it. Thank you. Just a last quick one. Congratulations on your aggressive share repurchase in the fourth quarter. Should we assume that you carry your comparable opportunistic approach into this year? And would you legally have been able to buy any shares early in this quarter?","Phebe Novakovic","You wisely have assumed that we will continue our opportunistic buying. And you -- I think you well know about the mechanism for share buybacks during the blackout. So I think we\u2019ll leave a comment around that later. But we were very active in the fourth quarter, I think that's the way to think about it.","Howard Rubel","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe, just thinking about some of the good news that\u2019s going on in Marine, and just thinking back to your kind of your longer-term targets there, you\u2019ve had some really nice contract wins since those projections. So is this volume falling outside of that kind of scope for the 2020 targets? Or is this delivering you some additional upside, because it seems like you are tracking ahead of that. Just some additional color there would be great.","Phebe Novakovic","So the proponents of the growth we are going to see is, is at Electric Boat and submarines. We\u2019ve gotten some nice wins at past. I think they\u2019ve got 11 DDG-51s in their backlog now, and they will continue to turn through those. NASSCO started its first containership Matson about two months early. They\u2019re working on the next oiler, and they\u2019ve got that extraordinarily versatile platform in the ESB.","So they have done nicely with slow steady growth, but the real growth driver is Electric Boat. And you see that in two respects. Both on the \u2013 we\u2019ve got the Virginia class two-year volume in Block IV, and then Block V is a -- as I noted in my remarks, really a significant upgrade into the performance, and it is a let me just leave it at that. It is -- it will drive additional revenue, incremental revenue. And then the advent of the Columbia, which will begin early construction in next year. So this is a steady growth engine for us as we\u2019ve been saying for some time. I\u2019m very pleased with them.","Operator","Our next question and our last question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Thank you for squeezing me on. Phebe, just another question on sort of product development. As you think about sort of the long-term and some lessons learned on the G650. You talked a lot about speed before as being an important value proposition to your new customers for these high-end products.","Is there any sort of evolving sort of appetite for new capabilities beyond just speed, as you think about product development in the next 5 to 10 years? Is it like runway access, access to remote regions, anything like that? Or is it really just sort of like a speed concept to sort of the next value proposition?","Phebe Novakovic","Speed is important, but as you can well imagine, we continue to upgrade and innovate around the avionics, cabin comfort, and the engines, both in fuel efficiency, decibel levels, and -- and look, these airplanes are getting better and better and better across the spectrum. Speed, for us, is an important commodity, because people\u2019s time is precious, so you\u2019re quite right, deposit, but that has been our focus, but it is by no means the single and exclusive focus.","Hunter Keay","Thank you.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, operator. With that we will end our call. If you -- if anybody has follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out and call me. My number is 703-876-3117.

And welcome to the General Dynamics' First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.","At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks Howard and good morning all. Earlier today we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share and revenue just shy of $9.3 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first quarter of 2018 due in large part to the acquisition of CSRA However, without CSRA revenue was up an impressive 9.6% on a purely organic basis. In fact, there was organic revenue growth across all five operating segments. ","EPS of $2.56 was $0.14 better than consensus, it would appear that revenue was some $400 million higher than anticipated by the sell - side and operating earnings were up about $40 million higher. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion were just ahead of the year-ago result despite modest declines at aerospace, marine and combat systems. The result benefited from the combination of CSRA with GDIT. ","The operating margin of 10.9% in the quarter was good, it did not compare favorably last year's stellar first quarter of 13.4% which was before the inclusion of amortization from CSRA transaction. ","Net earnings were down $54 million over the same quarter in 2018. Higher interest expense, somewhat higher taxes were the cause of lower net income. It follows that earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09 below the first quarter 2018, a 3% drop. Apart from the impressive revenue growth, an important part of the story in the quarter was order intake and growth in backlog. Total backlog grew to $69.2 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion compared to the end of last year. ","Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the book-to-bill for the company was an impressive 1.2. Broken down into 1.1 to 1 for defense and 1.4 to 1 for aerospace. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.2 billion was $450 million, or 22.7% ahead of the year ago period. This is attributable in large part to the delivery of seven G500 in the quarter and a solid increase in service revenue.","The moderately lower operating earnings were related to the mix shift at Gulfstream from the delivery of the G500. These planes carry the burden of the test program and retrofits as we previously advised. Margins on the aircraft will improve markedly through the year. At year-end, we had indicated that aerospace margins for the first two quarters would be in the mid 14% range, up somewhat from the 14.1% rate in the final period of 2018.","At 14.6%, the margin was fractionally better than that indication. Excluding the adverse impact on margins from pre-owned sales, margins would have been about 40 basis points better. Based on our delivery profile and cost improvement, we continue to expect overall margins to improve particularly so in the second half of the year. On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good. The book-to-bill at aerospace was 1.4:1 dollar denominated. The Gulfstream book-to-bill was even better.","We grew the backlog for the G650 and also expanded the G500 and 600 backlog. For the 12 trailing months, aerospace book-to-bill was about 1.1 to 1. You can see more information on the quarter's deliveries and orders in exhibit J at the press release. We anticipate the G600 will be certified late June, but timing is difficult to predict given the FAA rigorous review process. Nonetheless, we expect certification of the 600 this quarter or early next deliveries will remain on track for the second half.","While the pacing items for deliveries on the 500 and 600 is our ability to deliver nacelle, this is becoming less of an issue as you can discern from deliveries of the G500 in the fourth quarter and the last quarter. Nacelle costs are increasingly under control and we are producing very good quality. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. So forgive me this commercial plug, but earlier this month the G650 shattered a record for speed and range demonstrating its unrivaled performance.","The aircraft flew 8,379 nautical miles from Singapore to Tucson in 15 hours and 23 minutes, averaging Mach 0.85, beating the record set just a few weeks earlier by the competitor's aircraft by 44 minutes. It is also interesting that the G650 traveled during that flight approximately 227 nautical miles further than the competitor's aircraft in considerably less time. This is to our knowledge the longest distance ever flown by any business aviation aircraft.","This is of a particular interest to customers who think that the range and speed at that range is of vital importance. Next combat. ","Combat revenue of $1.6 billion was 13.6% above the year ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings declined $18 million with an operating margin of 12.6%. Mix was a large factor behind the results. There was strong growth in the Abrams program and a ramp up of mobile protective firepower and other new program. Stryker volumes were down, but we ascribe that to timing. Munitions also delivered growth. We also took a one-time charge in the quarter related to the disposition of a legal dispute over the closeout of a lease one of our former European operating site.","Absent that one-time item, earnings for this segment would have been up year-over-year. The diplomatic issues that have slowed production on the international vehicle program in Canada are in the process of being resolved. Once resolved between the two countries, we will see a reduction in operating working capital and the corresponding increase in cash received. Backlog for this segment is lumpy, with the fourth quarter traditionally seeing the highest order activity in the first quarter the slowest this year was no exception. The $2.2 billion in orders received in Q4 followed by the approximately $1.2 billion in orders received this quarter gives us good line of sight for our production planning and continuous improvement methodology.","Of note, Stryker backlog grew in the first quarter and the Army added funding to the SEP v4, the next generation of the Abrams Main Battle Tank. Stryker is a very flexible platform and the Army continues to find additional systems and weapons that we are integrating on to the vehicle. Integration of new capabilities onto our vehicles leverages our investments. Our intimate knowledge of the platform ensures that the Army receives its programs reliably and affordably. We also continue to see opportunities to expand the Ordnance and Tactical munitions businesses as the Army refreshes its ordinance and ammo stockpiles. We continue to have significant international opportunities throughout NATO and Eastern Europe, as well as the Pacific region.","Next, Marine Systems. Marine revenues of $2.1 billion was up slightly and operating earnings of $118 million were down $4 million against the year ago quarter. Operating margins were 8.7% with our guidance for the year at 8.5%. We are modestly ahead of target. We have delivered the 17th ship of the Virginia-class program and have another 11 in various stages of construction. With respect to Columbia, we are 97% complete with the detailed design and nearly 43% complete with the construction design drawn. We will be at 83% complete at the start of construction, far in excess of historical design completion metrics for any class of warships. We have begun long-lead material construction on Columbia and will begin full construction of the first ship late next year.","In response to the significant increase in demand from our Navy customer across all three of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis at Electric Boat to prepare for the higher production associated with Block V of the Virginia program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, both, Columbia and the Block V represent a significant increase in size and performance by acquiring additional manufacturing capacity and different logistics infrastructure to transport the larger modules from Quonset point to the waterfront at Groton for final assembly and test.","CapEx in 2018 for Marine Systems was $243 million, more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the largest share of our capital budget, about half of our entire CapEx. Suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customers they seek to increase the size of their fleet.","Next Information Technology. For the quarter, IT generated revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $156 million with an operating margin of 7.2%. Since the numbers for the first quarter 2018 did not include CSRA, comparisons to the year-ago quarter are not meaningful. Revenue of $2.2 billion is up by over $1 billion, but is down about $200 million sequentially, over half of which is attributable to the divestiture of the call centers and the remaining the wind down of several mature programs replaced by the ramp up of new program. Margin is 7.2% is lower than Q4, due to mix, but a bit better than Q2 and Q3 of 2018. ","If you look at our EBITDA margin, it is 12.4% including state and local taxes in the operating results. If these taxes were carried below the line as in the case for most competitors in this segment, it would add approximately 50 basis points to our results. This places the business in the best-in-class category for its industry.","The integration has gone well and is a bit ahead of the plan we put in place last year. We are taking the best of the two legacy companies and building a highly competitive enterprise with the scale and the resources to create value for our customers and our shareholders. GDIT's book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.1 to 1 and for the trailing four quarters, it is over 1 to 1. This business is growing and is positioned for growth going forward. The first quarter included some notable wins, a $490 million contract from DISA to support Pentagon network infrastructure, $125 million for helicopter training and simulation at Fort Rucker, $580 million for several classified programs and a myriad of additional wins across the portfolio.","Finally for Mission Systems, revenue rose by 5.5% compared to the year ago quarter, while operating earnings of $148 million were $2 million higher than the first quarter of last year with a 50 basis point decrement in operating margins attributable solely to mix. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1 times, following 1 to 1 book-for-Bill for this for each of the last two years. As you can see, we ended the quarter with a backlog of $5.3 billion, essentially level with the prior quarter and with the year ago quarter. Demand was broad based across many of their space and naval programs. Army Ground systems activity was particularly strong. ","So in my view, we're off to a good start to the year. The story in the first quarter was about revenue and backlog growth. Orders at $10.7 billion across our businesses provide us with good operational visibility. Our ongoing focus on productivity provides the opportunity to deliver very good results.","As we begin this quarter, we expect our second quarter performance to be very similar to the first quarter from an EPS perspective. You may recall that we do not as practice change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at mid-year -- at mid point during the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results.","Let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary and then take your questions.","Jason Aiken","Thank you. Phebe and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $117 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments on one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada.","Our free cash flow of negative $976 million was impacted by the payment delays and as we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $181 million in the quarter were up about 75% from the year ago quarter as we invest in our shipyards to support the significant growth that is on the horizon. We still expect this year to be the peak at approximately 3% of revenues and returning to the 2% range thereafter.","In the quarter, we paid $268 million in dividends and we spent $86 million on the repurchase of 525,000 of our shares. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $673 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.9 billion.","Our effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year tax rate guidance. As Phebe noted, order activity and backlog were particularly strong story in the quarter, as four of our five segments posted a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, even as we grew almost 10% organically. On that note, I think it bears a reminder that not all companies report book-to-bill on the same basis. We calculate this measure based on the firm backlog as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles excluding the value associated with IDIQ contracts. That's of course most relevant to Mission Systems in GDIT, each of which had a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, even under the more conservative GAAP definition.","We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $69.2 billion, that's up 2% over year-end 2018 and up 11% over this time a year ago. The total potential contract value including options in IDIQ contracts with $103 billion, consistent with year-end and up almost 18% over a year ago. There is one final item I'd like to highlight, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective of January 1, of this year on a prospective basis. We recorded a $1.4 billion liability for our operating leases along with the corresponding asset. This creates a visible change in our other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, but otherwise has no impact on our net earnings or cash flows.","Now, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Jamie, would you please remind participants, how to enter the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question today comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","DougHarned","Yes, good morning, thanks. Hi, I wanted to -- if we get a little better understanding on the margin trajectory at Gulfstream, you talked before in the last quarter about the lower margins to beginning of the year and likely very attractive margins when you get out to Q4. Could you give us a sense of what's behind that trajectory and are those higher margins at the end of the year? Are those the sort of normal margins that we might expect going forward beyond this year?","PhebeNovakovic","And as I said in my remarks, the margin rate is largely attributable to the mix and as we've talked about fairly frequently, that mix is driven by the increased deliveries on the G500, which carry lower margin in that first accounting lot, but we're going to be through that in the second quarter. And look, I think we've been pretty, quite transparent about this change in mix. We'll work our ways through it, as we deliver more G500s and the G600s will enter into service all with good margin. So when I think about it, our margins will improve throughout the year and as we go into next year our performance will get even better and better. As yet -- we hit full-rate production on the G500 and G600 and continue to come down our learning curves.","DougHarned","And then when you get out there in the G500 and G600 are mature, is it possible to give us a sense of how you might think about that between for the G550 mature margins and G650 mature margins? Where were the G500 and G600 shakeout?","PhebeNovakovic","Well, the G650, nothing's going to come close to that for I think all the reasons you understand. But it is our expectation that the G500 and G600 surpass the G450 and G550 peak margins. They are built and purpose-built facilities that are coming down, straight line and we have over that time continued to perfect our manufacturing processes. So I -- when we are up, we're really, really running. I think we're going to be better than those two legacy airplanes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question.","RobertStallard","Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe, just to start off with Aerospace. You noted the good demand for the G650 in the quarter. Are you still going to stick with your plan to gradually ease G650 deliveries over time?","PhebeNovakovic","Yes. So a little bit this year, and then more in next year and the following year when G500s and G600s are in -- as I say, full-rate production with good margins.","RobertStallard","Okay. And then as a follow-up on GDIT, you noted a good book-to-bill in the quarter. How sustainable do you think this is? And what's the expected conversion of that book-to-bill to revenues over time?","PhebeNovakovic","Well, when we put something in firm backlog, it's pretty sure conversion into revenue. But let me give you a little bit of context to it. I think it helps to understand. So GDIT in the quarter at 1.1 to 1 book-to-bill and over the last four quarters as I mentioned in my remarks they add 1 to 1. Now their win rate, they have demonstrated a win rate consecutively over those last four quarters between 70% and 75%. Against Dow's performance indicator, you've got a budget that is growing by 5%. So, I think this business is in very good stead for continued growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","RonaldEpstein","Hey. Good morning. Maybe a bigger, excuse me, a bigger strategic question. How are you thinking about Mission Systems? Right. I mean, their performance in the quarter was pretty good. And how do you think about growing that or it seems like it's sub-scale right now, right. Do you grow it? Do you sell it? What do you do with it, I mean, when you think about it?","PhebeNovakovic","So, given its portfolio, I don't believe that it's sub-scale. If you think about what they really are is, they are systems integrators with a significant products business. They've got some long-term franchise programs, a number of them and those programs are growing. So I like where they are, they've got some unique positioning, in fact, best-of-class position in a number of areas, in network security, cyber protection, accuracy and position, navigation in a GPS environment, integration of systems on the ballistic missile class submarines and the fire control system. So they assist something.","These are programs that they've had for a long, long time, all of which are on the growth trajectories. So, I don't really see them as sub-scale. And again, their margins are really quite nice. This is a good operating leverage company. I think they play nicely in the space therein, and we're quite comfortable with this.","RonaldEpstein","Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-on in Aerospace. Can you say when is the next available delivery slot for G650?","PhebeNovakovic","Yes, I'm not getting into that anymore, so we're really not tracking it that way. We've got a whole lot of new airplanes coming on. So those individual metrics become little less meaningful, but you need to think about what's really unusual and unique about the Gulfstream portfolio, as we have a family now of all brand new airplanes and when I say brand new, they are clean sheet, you know that better than anybody what that means, from scratch all new, nobody else has that, and that family is compelling, and we're seeing that in our consistent demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead with your question.","GeorgeShapiro","Yes, good morning. On the Gulfstream, Phebe, are we seeing the trend for orders continue were strong in the second quarter here?","PhebeNovakovic","So we're off to a good start, but undergirding this, you raise -- undergirding your question is really a -- I think more robust demand question. And like I think I'll take this opportunity to help us think about demand a little bit more holistically. It's kind of folly to try to address demand prospectively. It's a little bit easier from a retrospective point of view, as long as one's not too myopic about the data. So what does the data tell us? That the market for Gulfstream airplane has been good over the last 12 months at a period of ramped up deliveries. ","The book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5 to 1 at Gulfstream and almost 1.1 to 1 for the trailing 12 months. This tells me that we're in a period of solid, but not overheated demand. And I see nothing in the data available to me at the moment that suggests a change in that picture. So that's how you ought to think about, as we go through the year, our expectations about the demand environment.","GeorgeShapiro","And then just a quick one on Marine. The revenues were somewhat less than I would have thought given the guidance of up 6% for the year and the margin was somewhat better. As we get increased revenues throughout the year, do we have the opportunity that the margin turns out to be higher than your 8.5%?","PhebeNovakovic","Well, look we'll always work towards improved margins. But remember the revenue is simply a question of timing and mix. And as we move from the Block III to Block IV, we have accounted for those margin changes as we see in every -- by the way we see this and you know this and every one of our transition from one block to the other, because we bid down a continuous learning curve and we have a -- each one of our contracts has the same sort of target profit. And on a share lines, so we always give back some of that goodness appropriately. So did the U.S. Navy, but what does that mean? ","That means we've got to drive our operating performance relentlessly and continuously and we've done that now for 20 years. So, we will work very hard to consolidate and accelerate our learning on the Block IV, but at the moment we're pretty comfortable with the guidance we gave you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","DavidStrauss","Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, want to try and put a finer point on GDIT. I think publicly it's been said that while '18 and '19 a relatively flat from a revenue standpoint that the '18 to 2020 kind of growth rate, you're still looking for is mid-single digits, is that correct?","PhebeNovakovic","Yes. And I don't think we've given you a whole lot of specificity about '20, but I tried to set some context to how to think about this growth profile. With that win rates, with the increasing budget and post-acquisition book-to-bill, we're in a very good place. So I look at this business as long-term good growth. In that budget it was about $100 billion, their addressable market budget is about $120 billion, 5% increase, almost 5% increase. That's pretty darn impressive. Good opportunities there.","DavidStrauss","Thanks. As a follow-up, Jason. Any quantification you can give on what the drag was in Q1 from the delay on the international side and any sort of idea around timing? I know you're expecting to reverse this year, but are this more of a second half item that you're looking for? Thanks.","JasonAiken","Yes, so the amount that continue to push to the right, I think of it as a roughly $1 billion, David, that's what we're talking about. It's lapsed over from last year and continues to push to the right.","PhebeNovakovic","And I think it's important to understand that these are negotiations between two sovereign powers, that are progressing, but they're very, very sensitive, as all of diplomatic negotiations are. Progress is good, but slow. We do anticipate it resolving this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","CaivonRumohr","Yes, thank you so much. So Phebe, I thought I heard you say that the Gulfstream 500 would move into the second production block in the second quarter. If that's the case, how come the margins aren't better than the first?","PhebeNovakovic","I think second half is what I said.","CaivonRumohr","Second half, excuse.","PhebeNovakovic","Yes. So I mean that's the inference from us being through that first block right, and we'll get through that in this quarter and get into the second lot in the second quarter. So, you're right.","CaivonRumohr","Got it. So GDIT obviously, you're looking for pretty good bookings. It's kind of we look around, there are several very large competitions for competitor programs in the network space, GSM-O and NextGen are, how in terms of looking at your expected growth do you factor those? Because obviously you have other competitors and if you win, things are going to be a lot better and if you lose, they won't be as good as you're projecting. So how do you factor them?","PhebeNovakovic","So if you think about us and you know us and you've known us for years. We are conservative, when we look at opportunities. We give healthy discount rates, I think that are a good thing to do for internally for the business and the forecast and guidance that we issue reflects that, those discounted rates. So the beauty of a business with 7,000 contracts is that frankly no one is positive. But I'm comfortable that they'll win their fair share. That said, we've approached this -- their pipeline through -- looking through a conservative prism.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","PeterArment","Yes, thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe, first question on Combat I guess, you mentioned some very positive comments regarding the fiscal '20 funding levels for some of the core platforms. I guess maybe just in the context of longer-term growth, how you're thinking about how those programs are shaping up domestically? And then what some of the international opportunities that you're pursuing are for that could supplement that growth? Thanks.","PhebeNovakovic","Sure. So the U.S. Army is recapitalizing, after the hot wars, they have utilized a lot of their equipment and as their budget slowed down rather precipitously, they did not have the resource to go and recapitalized, but they do now and that's exactly what they're doing. So they're modernizing their existing fleet in addition to developing new potential platforms. And we -- that existing fleet is our program, right. Stryker and Abrams have seen considerable increases in their budget funding lines because the Army needs those vehicles.","The Abrams remains an outstanding tank and the upgrade in the version 4, is really not your father's Abram. It is a more capable, more survivable, more lethal system as is the Stryker. So we think those twp core franchise programs for us are in very, very good stead. We work very closely with our Army customer to understand their demands and their requirements and how they think about the war fighter and so we position ourselves in our investment dollars and also, thinking about the art of the possible for them and how we can help them meet their objectives.","That's certainly true on the franchise programs. I've just talked about, but also on new programs, what is in the art of the possible what's doable how fast you can do it and what it is going cost you. And the key there is to have the trust of the Army customer, who believes that the estimates that you give them are reliable. So we've had a -- we are very aligned with our Army customer, know where they're headed. And I frankly like everything that I see here. And that's on the big vehicle programs, when I look at ammunition business, ammunition business is growing. I think we grew 10% in the quarter.","And we've had our book-to-bill, there that's been very wholesome because as we increase our operational training tempo, our munitions and armaments will increase demands. So outside the United States, in North America, outside of the United States we see some recapitalization in the UK and Canada, where we have decade's long presence in both of those countries, throughout NATO and heavily in Eastern European. The world is getting a more dangerous place and unfortunately, but that is -- that creates demand for our products.","Our European Land Systems has multiple opportunities throughout the Former Soviet Border States and Eastern Block and domestically and elsewhere. So you know threats drive funding and they drive the need for requirements and unfortunately we live in a world have increased threat.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","SheilaKahyaoglu","Good morning and thank you for the time, everyone, good quarter. Just a bigger picture question, I mean revenues were up I think 23% this quarter and profit was sort of flattish. How do we think about that inflection and profit growth in excess of revenue growth and timing of that and any maybe impediments to that that you see.","PhebeNovakovic","So let's break the businesses into two distinct factors. Aerospace, I think we've just given you a pretty fulsome and I going to walk you through that again, pretty fulsome explanation of the margin compression. And on the defense side, it's really about mix. When you're growing and you've got new contracts coming in, and you've got older contracts closing, you're going to have the mix issues and we frankly because all of our defense businesses are growing we have some of that right now.","So that will resolve in continuing throughout the year and then into the future years as we get -- one thing you can absolutely rely on us for is superb operating performance. We are very good at improving what we control and we control our own operations. So you can expect us to get better and better and better as time goes by.","SheilaKahyaoglu","Thanks. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up, I think you mentioned $1 billion contract in Aerospace last quarter, was that booked?","PhebeNovakovic","I'm sorry, where?","SheilaKahyaoglu","You mentioned in Aerospace $1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer, was that booked in the quarter?","PhebeNovakovic","Right. So I couldn't hear you out. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Please go ahead with your question.","CarterCopeland","Good morning Phebe, Jason and Howard. Just two quick ones. One on the assumed certification on the G600 Phebe, do you think there's any risk there, just given the extra scrutiny and -- on things like ODA and what not, given the incident elsewhere in the industry, just -- I wonder if you could share any thoughts on that and just help give us some color, if there's any risk?","PhebeNovakovic","So, first the FAA and as we're targeting late June, but they've got a pretty rigorous process, so that may slip a week -- a couple of weeks or so, but I think importantly that does not impact our deliveries, which is really, I think the key underlying question. We have, not seen any new regulations or any new changes and the FAA oversight. So, we work very closely with them. Frankly, their partners and ensuring that we deliver base airplanes efficiently, and so they've got an additional workload, but so far haven't really seen much of an impact.","CarterCopeland","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up. I noted the comments you made in the prepared remarks, around the cost progress on the missiles and the quality there, and obviously there's some uncertainty and risk when you took that work on, is there in your view the opportunity to maybe favorably retire some of that risk that you had foreseen as you continue to make progress and is this an indication maybe you're headed in that direction?","PhebeNovakovic","So cost is increasingly under control. The schedules, we de-risked a lot of the schedules. We're getting a lot of input from the manufacturing workforce, which will help us optimize our production, and again we're very, very good at manufacturing. So a lot of that risk is definitely behind us and it's going to get better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","SethSeifman","Thanks very much and good morning. So I wanted to follow up on question that Peter asked earlier about the Combat business and when we look at the budgets that have come out for Abrams over the past couple of years and what's being requested for 2020. It's kind of in $2 billion-ish range, which seems like it's probably at least 2x, if not more what the Abram sales were last year. I mean should we be expecting Abrams sales over the next couple of years to advance to this level.","PhebeNovakovic","You should expect them to advance. Think about it this way, for a while that in the period where the Army funding was seriously constrained, that tank plant was producing one tank a month. At the end of this year, we'll be rolling out 30 tanks a months by the end of this year. So that obviously will drive revenue growth and that backlog increase translates 1 to 1 in the revenue.","SethSeifman","All right. And then just a follow-up 1.1, when we think about a point that you guys have made consistently in the past, is the impact of a mix shift towards domestic production on profitability in combat. Is that primarily an Abrams issue? Because you mentioned some -- that there's growth in Stryker, there's growth on the weapons and munition side. Is that primarily an Abram issue?","PhebeNovakovic","So there are two things. There is mix between domestic and international. And there's also the mix issue driven by older contracts and newer ones coming on board. So as Abram ramps up, remember we're also doing the mobile protective firepower. We were one of the two down select and so those -- again, we've got to move down our learning curve and that will ensue the performance over time.","HowardRubel","And operator, we'll just take one more question, please.","Operator","And our final question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead with your question .","MylesWalton","Thanks. Good morning. And Phebe, I'm curious, could you reflect on the certification process for the G500, G600 and how maybe it would influence your thinking of the next new aircraft? How you kind of publicly launch it versus privately launch it? Should we expect kind of timelines from public launch to anticipated EIS to maybe be a little bit shorter as you do more of the certification work behind the curtain?","PhebeNovakovic","Myles, if I told you any of that, that is just proprietary, but of -- listen, you would expect us to have lessons learned from everything we do. These have been extraordinarily successful developmental programs as these have been an extraordinarily successful test program. These airplanes are beating all of their design performance specifications. So we will continue to work closely with our FAA customer and it will continue to refine our processes going forward. But when we announce anything or how we announce that just sensitive.","MylesWalton","Okay. And Jason a clarification, the $1 billion push to the right, you mentioned on the Canadian LAV contract for Saudi. I think in the K, you've said $1.9 billion of unbilled receivables. Curious, can you kind of square those two and also the size of the current unbilled receivable? Thanks.","JasonAiken","Sure. So the balance between the two is basically the contract work in process. It's ongoing as you'd expect on any contract of this size. So that really is the delta there. And you'll see in the 10-Q we published later today that $1.9 billion that was reported at the end of the year is now up to $2.2 billion.","End of Q&A","Howard Rubel","Operator. Thank you very much.

My name is Grant, and I'll be your event operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Amy  Gilliland","Thank you, Grant, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.","Jay L. Johnson","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' third quarter sales totaled $7.9 billion, up modestly from last year's third quarter on strong Aerospace volume. Operating earnings were $905 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis. Third quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $594 million, nearly 100% of earnings from continuing operations. This result is particularly strong given the $321 million of pension contributions we made in the quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion is a healthy 90% of earnings from continuing operations. And I expect the fourth quarter to be another strong cash quarter.","In terms of capital deployment, we remain cautious given the unprecedented uncertainty in the coming months caused by the threat of sequestration. For that reason, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter and may not do so until we see more clearly what happens at the start of 2013.","We did take advantage of opportunities to deploy $261 million this summer to enhance our defense portfolio with 4 bolt-on acquisitions. These new businesses, which I will detail later in my remarks, better position each of our 3 defense segments for significant future opportunities. In addition to these accretive acquisitions, our multi-year Gulfstream campus investment project continues.","Year-to-date, we've returned approximately 70% of free cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Orders this quarter were the strongest of the year, driven by improved award activity at Aerospace and IS&T. At the end of the quarter, backlog was $51.5 billion; while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog in the value of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts, stood at $77.5 billion.","Let me briefly address what we're experiencing in today's aerospace and defense environment. Defense bottom line upfront. There's been very little change to the situation for our U.S. Defense businesses since my last update on the second quarter call, except that as predicted, we are now in a continuing resolution through March of next year and we are closer to the fiscal cliff. The same uncertainty regarding the defense budget adjustments that has challenged our industry for the past year continued to impact our customers' behavior in the third quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle businesses where bids awaiting awards are at record levels and descoping actions are becoming much more common practice. We are likely to see more of this in the fourth quarter. We would hope to receive some clarifying details over the next 2 months as this election cycle ends and the Congress returns to address the many important fiscal issues confronting our country.","In light of the significant legislative workload, in the limited lame-duck timeline however, it remains difficult to predict whether sequestration will be resolved before January. With that said, discussion about the negative implications of going over the fiscal cliff at year end has escalated in recent weeks. We hope that a bipartisan solution can be brokered to address these serious issues before they take effect in 2013.","With limited detail on how sequestration would be implemented, planning for next year is difficult at best. Our government customer continues to assert that there is no -- there are no ongoing planning efforts to prepare for implementing sequestration, should it be triggered. The indiscriminate across-the-board nature of sequestration cuts are troubling for Defense, as well as other federal agencies. Given the lack of planning to date however, we are also extremely concerned about the profound disruption and paralysis that implementing these cuts will likely have on our customer and thus, our entire industry. We continue to focus on managing for earnings and cash, cutting costs and positioning our businesses to better navigate further defense cuts.","In Aerospace, we remain encouraged by Gulfstream's sizable large cabin backlog and healthy order pipeline. Several multi-aircraft orders from North American customers, which we had originally expected in the second quarter, materialized in the third quarter. Relative to other periods, however, the order cycle remains somewhat protracted with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. Global economic sentiment, particularly in Europe and Asia, and political uncertainty here and abroad continue to influence the velocity of order activity. We continue to believe that we will realize several multi-aircraft international orders in the coming months, although their exact timing for all the factors I just explained is difficult to predict.","Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, beginning with IS&T. IS&T sales were $2.5 billion in the third quarter, off somewhat from our expectations, but relatively flat compared to this year's second quarter. Sales through the first half of 2012 as in 2011 reflected continued pressure in our tactical communications business.","In the third quarter, however, tactical communications volume was close to our forecast as encryption demand stabilized, albeit at lower levels. Common Hardware Systems-4 program awards improved and development program contract awards, including JTRS and WIN-T, progressed.","Volume at our IT service business on the other hand was somewhat lower than expected due to delayed award activity, scope reductions and award losses spawned by renewed customer interest in lowest-priced technically acceptable solutions that favor price over experience and product quality.","The group's third quarter operating earnings and margins were $200 million -- $201 million and 8.1%, respectively. These results were negatively impacted by a $25 million charge taken on ruggedized computing equipment inventory at our tactical communications business. We are reorienting that portfolio to focus on -- less on volatile lower margin commoditized products and more on cutting-edge solutions that better align with our core customers' current and emerging priorities. Without the charge, group margins would have been 100 basis points better at 9.1%. This return on sales reflects an overall portfolio mix shift towards service work, an altered mix and lower level of tactical communications volume and continued competitive pressures in this segment as more bidders pursue fewer contracts.","Although delayed award activity impacted group sales through the first 3 quarters, IS&T enjoyed its strongest order quarter in 2 years in the third quarter, causing backlog to increase by approximately $800 million to $10.1 billion. Award activity was particularly notable in our tactical communications and IT service businesses.","Several of the awards received are long awaited and exemplify the customers' continuing focus on network modernization. These included a $346 million award to continue fielding the Warfighter Information Network, WIN-T Increment 2 capability, and a $54 million award for an additional 13,000 JTRS HMS Rifleman radios and accessory kits. Subsequent to the quarter, we also received an award for another 3,700 JTRS HMS Manpack radios.","Awards in our IT service business included a significant opportunity to provide supply chain management services to a relatively new customer, the Department of State, as well as myriad other contracts to provide critical IT support capabilities to existing customers across the federal government. Additional details about contracts received in the quarter are included in today's earnings press release.","IS&T's total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, increased $1 billion to over $32 billion at quarter end, an improved opportunity set both year-over-year and sequentially. We further enhanced our IS&T portfolio in the third quarter with 2 acquisitions that bolster our presence in priority areas.","Open Kernel Labs, now a part of our tactical communications division, brings to our portfolio solutions that enable the secure separation of corporate data from a user's personal data stored on the same device. This technology has wide range in commercial and government applications, as employers increasingly look to better manage IT costs through bring-your-own-device policies. And Fidelis Security Systems, now a part of our industry-leading cyber business, offers highly-regarded software capable of identifying network intruders and preventing hackers from stealing proprietary information. Fidelis's product complements our unique portfolio of cyber incident response capabilities and better positions us for new opportunities as cyber investments grow.","Looking ahead, fourth quarter sales will be the group's largest this year as the tactical communications and IT services businesses begin to realize revenues associated with the delayed award activity added to backlog in the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to be down around 8% to 9%, a reduction from my previous guidance. Volume will depend in large part on how rapidly our recent orders translate to sales. Margins for the year will be around 9%.","Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems' third quarter sales totaled nearly $2 billion, reflecting growing foreign military Light Armored Vehicles sales and ground combat vehicle volume, offset by lower Stryker, Abrams, MRAP and European vehicle work. While the decline in these vehicle programs was expected, the group's volume in the quarter was somewhat lighter than we anticipated due to the delay in several anticipated awards. With many of these awards now in hand or imminent, we expect to realize this incremental volume in the fourth quarter.","The group's earnings were $274 million, resulting in a 14% operating margin. This margin continues to reflect excellent performance across combat's portfolio of domestic businesses. Our European Land Systems business continues to confront profitability pressures driven by delays in international awards, which reflect the group's challenged indigenous markets and absorption impacts from lower-than-anticipated volume.","ELS is aggressively going after cost and has already reduced 20% of its workforce, consolidated or closed numerous facilities around Europe, and implemented a variety of continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives.","Total backlog for Combat Systems was $9.4 billion at the end of the quarter. Notable orders in the quarter included $50 million to provide additional Foxhound vehicles to the United Kingdom, $135 million to supply ammunition to Canada and $400 million for research and development efforts to enhance the Abrams tank.","Over the next few quarters, we will continue to track several meaningful international order opportunities, including tank upgrades for Morocco and Middle Eastern customers, EAGLE vehicles for Germany and Light Armored Vehicles for several international customers. Although it does not add to today's manufacturing workload, the sizable 8-year Abrams R&D contract received this quarter clearly demonstrates the army customer's long-term commitment to improving the tank's capabilities.","For its current planning documents, the Army envisions incorporating Abrams improvements arising from this R&D contract in the 2017 time frame. Consequently, it's important to preserve a healthy and reliable tank industrial base in the interim. The Congress continued to support this notion in the 2013 budget process with all 4 committees adding tank manufacturing funding to the president's budget request.","Looming future budget cuts have inhibited the ability of the Pentagon, and in turn our army customer, to solidify the size and shape of the future force. We remain confident, however, that our incumbency in the force will yield a wide range of opportunities to provide our customer affordable, enhanced war fighting platforms.","The Stryker Double-V Hull is an excellent example of GD leveraging our experience to bring cost-efficient solutions to the customer. The life-saving benefit of the double-V was established in Afghanistan over the course of the past 18 months. However, prior to the customer's second quarter conversion order, we had not demonstrated our ability to transform flat bottom Strykers into the double-V hull configuration.","I'm pleased to say that the very first double-V hull exchange program vehicle is on exhibit at AUSA in Washington as we speak. Production of our initial conversion vehicles is running on time and budget, and we have decisively established the double-V hull exchange program's value proposition, creating more durable combat vehicles at a far lower cost.","The Army is currently analyzing the benefits of this program and working towards solidifying additional double-V hull requirements in conjunction with broader force structure studies. Given the success of the program to date, we anticipate additional conversion orders.","Similarly, our Combat Systems group remains involved in a variety of development programs for our Army and Marine Corps customers. Our work on these development programs will help the customer identify and incorporate key technological advancements into today's vehicles and tomorrow's fighting force.","GD's focus on bringing affordable solutions to our customer is also evident in our acquisition of Gayston Corporation's defense operations this quarter. Gayston expands our critical manufacturing capability to more cost-efficiently produce high-precision parts on core franchise programs such as the hydro rocket, and provides us with more opportunities to participate in high-performance weapons programs.","Looking ahead, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest, with each of the businesses contributing their largest volume of the year. Margins will be somewhat lower due to mix shift as our newer international vehicle and development programs accelerate, and our mature domestic vehicle production work slows. For the full year, the group remains on track to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales and mid-13% margins.","Now I'll discuss Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. Sales of nearly $1.7 billion were relatively stable when compared with the prior-year period as destroyer, Mobile Landing Platform and repair volume grows, and the T-AKE Program winds down.","The group's repair-related sales increased primarily due to the third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Earl Industries, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2012, also enhanced the group's repair sales. Earl provides General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier multi-ship, multi-option, MSMO, contracts, and extends the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport. Earnings totaled $186 million, up modestly when compared with both last year and last quarter. The group's third quarter operating margin was 11.1%, driven primarily by continued strong performance on the T-AKE Program, which will see delivery of the 14th and final ship this week.","I also want to highlight that performance across several of our newer programs has been very good. In September, NASSCO completed the structural assembly and weld-out of over 26,000 tons of steel to erect the entire structure of the first MLP. Construction of this first-of-class ship is progressing on schedule and under budget with delivery plan for the second quarter of 2013.","At Bath Iron Works, progress continues on Zumwalt, the first DDG 1000, which is 70% complete in manufacturing and provides a most impressive sight on BIW's waterfront. Fabrication and unit assembly on the initial DDG 51 restart ships are also underway as we demonstrate our ability to simultaneously produce 2 different types of destroyers in our main shipyard.","Marine's backlog totaled nearly $16 billion at the end of the third quarter, while total estimated contract value, including backlog and unexercised options, was $17.3 billion. Orders this quarter included a $94 million award for planning activities on USS Miami, which you may recall was badly damaged by a fire earlier this year. The Navy has valued the total repair bill for their submarine at several hundred million dollars, and we anticipate additional repair work following the planning activities.","Third quarter 2012 orders are well down from the year-ago period when Marine Systems booked 3 destroyers and several substantive engineering and development contracts. But as you know, this merely reflects the very lumpy nature of Marine's award contract activity, where shipbuilding awards come periodically in large tranches and provide several years of backlog.","We expect several of these sizable awards next year, including the Navy's DDG 51 multi-year program and the Block IV Virginia-class submarine program. Other meaningful order activities on the horizon include the Ohio replacement class design contract and a fourth MLP ship planned for procurement in 2014.","Marine Systems' fourth quarter volumes will be lower than the previous 3 as the T-AKE Program concludes, while margins will approximate year-to-date profitability. For the full year, the group remains on track to achieve 2012 sales slightly below last year with margins in the mid-11% range.","Next, I'll move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group enjoyed a very successful third quarter, marked by improved order activity and the achievement of FAA type certification on our G280 and G650 aircraft. Group sales were $1.8 billion, up 30% from the year-ago period due to higher green G650 deliveries, while earnings were $261 million. Margins were 14.2%, down year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to lower Gulfstream R&D supplier payments. As a reminder, these payments vary from quarter-to-quarter and, therefore, can distort profitability comparisons. Profitability was also modestly lower at Jet Aviation this quarter, as the business works aggressively to confront overhead absorption issues exacerbated by the European debt crisis, which is impacting aircraft utilization and service work across the continent. With that said, Jet Aviation continues to take positive steps forward.","In the completions business, the jet team recently delivered the fourth narrow-body, wide-body aircraft of the year and added another narrow-body to the order book. Jet service operations are seeing mixed demand, with pockets of strength in some regions and continued weakness in Europe. The leadership team at Jet is working aggressively to address this dynamic situation by optimizing our maintenance and repair footprint to better address the requirements of the installed base moving forward, with a particular focus on rightsizing facility situated in slower markets and investing in our facilities and customer outreach in growth markets.","Gulfstream reported its best order quarter of the year, driven by several multi-aircraft deals placed by North American companies. Year-to-date, North American customers represent nearly 60% of Gulfstream's order book. This metric represents the resurgence of North American demand and some softening in the international demand, driven by political uncertainty in some regions and the overall negative impact of the European debt crisis on global economic sentiment. Even so, Gulfstream's international customer interest remains very healthy, and we continue to expect to solidify several multi-aircraft international deals in the coming months, as I previously mentioned.","Customer defaults in the quarter were at their lowest since the economic downturn began in 2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated Gulfstream book-to-bill was a little over 0.8x, reflecting improved overall award activity, offset by continued G650 deliveries. The group's backlog at quarter end stood at just over $16 billion, including approximately 5 years of G650 backlog and around 18 months of G450 and 550 deliveries. As I reiterated previously, because new orders for the 650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect new orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. That said, our sales force booked healthy orders for the G650 and each of our other aircraft models in the third quarter.","In terms of preowned, Gulfstream took 2 aircraft in trade this quarter, delivered 1 aircraft at breakeven and brokered another 1 for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, we had 3 preowned aircraft in inventory. Gulfstream's installed fleet flying hours were at pre-economic downturn levels        again in the third quarter, a reality that helped our service facilities enjoy another record volume quarter. In part, this continued success reflects Gulfstream's #1 ranking in worldwide product support.","In the quarter, Gulfstream product support was voted #1 for the 10th consecutive year in the Annual Aviation International News' Product Support Survey. Similarly, Gulfstream received the top service ranking in the yearly professional pilot survey. To meet growing customer demand, Gulfstream continues to invest in its product support network, including plans to open new company-owned service centers in Brazil and China.","Our enhanced global service network is particularly timely as we deliver new G650s and 280s. Both aircraft are enjoying robust customer interest, following type certification, and we are proud to showcase them at the NBAA convention in Orlando next week. The fact that together, these aircraft have already amassed 6 city pair records, including one transatlantic record each, is a testament not only to the capabilities of these aircraft, but also to the entire Gulfstream team. Entry into service when we deliver these aircraft to our first customers is just weeks away. All necessary preparations to support EIS are proceeding apace, including retrofit work and pilot training.","Looking to the fourth quarter, the Aerospace group expects its strongest sales quarter of the year, including entry-into-service deliveries for the 650 and 280. The composition of our planned 2012 deliveries has changed modestly. For initial stage deliveries, green deliveries, we now expect to deliver 24 G650s, that's really unchanged; 80 450s and 550s, that's up modestly; and 15 to 20 mid-cabin aircraft, that's, too, is up modestly. Planned completion deliveries for 450s and 550s and mid-cabins remain unchanged, while G650 completions will be somewhat lower than the 17 originally planned solely as a function of the later-than-anticipated type certification. For the full year, I expect Aerospace group sales to grow approximately 16% to 17%, up somewhat from my prior guidance, and operating margins to be in the mid-15% range.","In summary, General Dynamics made progress on several important fronts in the third quarter, including Gulfstream type certifications and JTRS and WIN-T orders. These franchise programs are now set to realize their full market potential. Given our year-to-date performance, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $7 to $7.05. However sequestration is resolved, all of us at General Dynamics will continue to aggressively manage our businesses for profitability, with primary emphasis on nailing execution in order to maximize earnings and cash. We remain focused on affecting what we can control to include leveraging our incumbency and experience to provide our customers with affordable, dependable and proven solutions.","With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?","L. Hugh Redd","Thank you, Jay, and good morning. I would like to cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $39 million for the quarter. Based on our current net debt position of $900 million, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million for the full year.","Next, the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the first 9 months compared with 30.6% for the same period of 2011. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of slightly less than 32%, rising slightly over 2011's rate at 31.4% due to the less income from international locations, where the tax rates are lower, and the exploration of the R&D tax credit here in the U.S.","Finally, during the quarter, we contributed approximately $321 million to our pension plans. To date, this year, we have contributed approximately $430 million to our plans, with full year funding expectation of $500 million.","Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it to you for the Q&A.","Amy  Gilliland","Thanks, Hugh. I'd like to highlight that a summary of the guidance provided this morning will be posted on our website, alongside the webcast link. [Operator Instructions]  And Greg, could you just please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jay, I'd like to follow up on your question that you felt that the uncertainty about the outlook held you back from buying back shares this quarter, yet you still felt confident enough to make a series of acquisitions. And I could wonder how you could contrast those 2 decisions.","Jay L. Johnson","Well, I think I've been fairly consistent in saying that one of the things we're trying to do right now is shepherd our cash, and I'm trying to provide my successor with as much cash as I can. So why the acquisitions? I said before, and I'll repeat it here, that we always are looking for acquisitions that make sense for our businesses. And when you take a longer view of what these acquisitions can provide, it takes you through the trough we're dealing with here into another space where we believe these things, as I said in my remarks, will give us significant opportunities. They weren't -- they were priced right when they come to market. You got to take them if you want to build that business, and that's exactly what we did in all 4 cases. So it's setting them up for longer-term opportunities, and we felt that was appropriate.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But isn't there a possibility these assets might have been cheaper if you'd waited maybe a few more months, 6 months, perhaps, until the sequester kicks in?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, maybe, maybe not, or they may not have been there. So they made sense for us at the time and we took them with no apologies.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Jay, just want to wish you all the best as you I'm sure do something that's not just sitting around, but not doing what you're doing today. So all the best from all of us. I had a quick question and just a clarification on something you said earlier. I think you recall the big contract that Vangent has with CMS is in recompete. I wondered if you might update us on where that stands and what the expectations are for award and what sort of impacts that may have. And then a clarification of your comments on Abrams sort of short-term, long-term and as you think about the Lima facility. Is it correct to assume that since you had committee support and were operating under a CR, this is a sort of wait and see what happens with the election and the budget outlook before we know, ultimately, what will happen with that program?","Jay L. Johnson","Okay. The latter first. As I said, we're fairly confident -- well, let me back up. The ECP1, as it is called, which I alluded to in my remarks, the long-term Abrams R&D contract, was very important to lock down, if you will, the long view on the Abrams. So we'll be working that on the engineering development side as we approach the 2017 time frame. But in the interim, as I said, it's really important to keep that facility in the industrial base intact, if you will. The 2012 budget supports Abrams through 2013, and what we believe will come out of the 2013 budget will push that out, at least, another year. That's kind of -- so are we taking it a year at a time in this instance? Absolutely. But we're all sight-lining to the 2017 longer view. So we're confident with the support we have, and so that will work itself out here in the coming months, okay? In addition to that, and recall I believe we've talked about this before, but we have international work that also will reside at that facility with the Moroccan tanks, which we expect the order by the end of the year or shortly thereafter, and we've got the Israel Namer Merkava hulls. We've got the Egyptian kits. So we've got a number of international programs that work through that facility as well. So our view is that, that we're getting the requisite support we need, and we'll do everything we can to keep that facility very functional for, as we've discussed many times, it's actually more about the supply chain than it is about General Dynamics with the 560-some suppliers that are tied to the Lima facility that we cannot afford to lose. So that, I think, perhaps answers the tank. The Vangent beneficiary call center, I believe I'm correct here, and Amy nods her head, that this will take place now next year. So we continue to work, we continue to execute, but the contract recompete will be at some point in 2013, which is a change. They pushed it out, but we continue to work since we're the incumbent.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was interested on Gulfstream. When you talk about the G650 and the fact that your backlog extends 5 years out, could you just refresh us on the rate plans for that? Because what I'm trying to understand is when you look at that 5-year backlog, what would lead you to raise rate? Is that limited by demand, limited by operational considerations? How do you look at that?","Jay L. Johnson","I mean, I guess, my answer, serious answer would be kind of all of the above. But we have -- as I mentioned, we continue to take orders for the 650. We're working through the production side now to get entry into service in the coming weeks. So we're hitting our battle rhythm or our flow, if you will. And as I said many times, the production, the delivery schedule, if you will, of record has 24 green deliveries this year and adding nominally 10 to 15 a year for the next few years with completion deliveries at 17, 33 and 33. Now I've just mentioned the 17 will change a little bit because of the lateness of the type certification. But nonetheless, the point is, that's the program of record, if you will. To change that, to wick it up, based on the demand, based on the 5-year backlog is certainly something we are desirous of doing, but we're not going to turn the rheostat up until we've hit, as I call it, our battle rhythm, and we're just not there yet.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It looks like -- I mean, certainly, internally, you would have the capability to do that. And I just was trying to understand if you saw -- sort of what time frame you might see supply chain limitations? Or when could the flexibility occur to take that rate up?","Jay L. Johnson","I mean, my view of that is probably if you look at what we've got now and the work that's taking place to complete the airplanes that have been green delivered and to get the flow going, okay, because of the late type certification, my sense of that is it will take probably another year or so to work that flow out smoothly and then, again, hit what I would call a steady production rate that's -- that then is capable of being accelerated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay, best of luck to you. If I look at Combat and the backlog, if I just look at what has been historically a backlog-to-sales ratio there, it's run well above one. If you look at the backlog today in the sales, say, it's right around one, which would seem to imply, obviously, you've talked about orders that could come through, through the rest of the year, but would seem to imply what could be a significant drop off still to come over the next 12 to 18 months. Could you just address that, Jay, and what we might be looking at Combat here over the near-term?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I mean, look, I'm not going to try to project the 2013 plan for Combat because we -- that's what's being worked right now as is our methodology every year. But the comment I'd make ties back to what we were talking about earlier with Abrams. We've got -- we know domestically, and I mentioned this in my remarks, what's the size and shape of the force ultimately going to be as things get re-cocked here as a function of the Afghanistan return and the reshape based on sequestration or no, and all of these things get sorted out. So how that force shapes itself will have impact on Combat quite obviously. So domestically, it comes down to the Stryker, which we talked about. Abrams, which we've talked about. It comes down to ground combat vehicle. It comes down to AMPV replacements, things like that, that will -- were an integral part of either competing for or are already doing all of those things. How that shapes itself is yet to be determined. We're confident in the longer view, as I said earlier, on Abrams. Stryker, we've got work to do, but we're very encouraged by the exchange program of the double-Vs, as I mentioned in my remarks. And we're fairly confident that they're going to continue converting -- we will continue converting flat bottoms to double-Vs. But the long-term opportunity on the domestic side will become more granular, I would say, frankly, within the next 6 to 8 months as we determine what's going to happen at the end of the year or the start of 2013. The international space, though, is really significant business for us. And as you've heard me say before, the projections there increased that as a part of combat's portfolio going forward. Both tanks, Light Armored Vehicles -- and those are the 2 primary movers, no pun intended, but we've got between the Middle East, Morocco, Israel, the Canadian LAV program, there's significant opportunities there for us going forward. So combat's going to have, as I mentioned before, we're integral to the force. We'll stay integral to the force. Exactly how that shapes itself will be determined, I think, in the coming months and year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And on 650, do you expect to have any completed deliveries this year? And can you give us a little bit more color on exactly what's going on there?","Jay L. Johnson","Sure, yes. I mean it won't be 17. It will be slightly less than that, but yes, we will have 650s delivered here within the next few weeks. I think the first 2 pilot classes, or the first 1 for sure is done. So then you have to go -- there's more to do with the FAA, you got to get certificate of airworthiness for each of the aircraft. So we're marching along smartly, but yes, indeed, we'll be delivering aircraft here within weeks. Anxious to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","I was wondering if you'd give a little more clarity on what R&D -- how much lower R&D or higher R&D was this year versus last year. And also sequentially, just so I can get a feel for, how much that hurt the operating margin. And also, was the completions business worse than the second quarter in terms of its loss? And how did it compare year-over-year, because I know it lost money last year as well.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I think my answer to the latter is, I think, it was about the same, pretty nominally close at least. That's off the top of my head, George. Your R&D question, it's interesting. If I look at the stream of R&D at Gulfstream across the year, it sounds like the way I described the backlog at the Marine group. It's very lumpy, and that's exactly what this is. And, oh, by the way, it just happens that the year-ago quarter and the sequential quarter were the lumpiest. So it just -- what can I do? That's just the way it hit. And almost by a factor of like 3.5 or 4:1. So it just -- that really is it. I mean, the margin impact derives -- there's a little bit, as I think I said in my remarks, that you could attribute to jet absorption costs but -- and some for liquidated damages, but that's in the noise, quite honestly. It really is the R&D and it's purely a function of the comparators.","George Shapiro","Okay. And I wondered if I could get one last one in here. If you took out the 650, was the book-to-bill for the other planes, the 550, 450, at 1 or above 1, because you had mentioned the backlog was 18 months and, I think, in previous times, you said 18 to 24 months. So was looking for some clarity on that.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I mean, I'll put it this way, and you know I always -- I look at it in backlog months as you just described. And we really are kind of closer to the 18 side of it right now. But I'm not that concerned, I'm not concerned at all about that, but it's interesting. We expect, as I mentioned in my remarks, back to my favorite word today, lumpy, but we expect some multi-aircraft orders that were there last year about this time that haven't manifested themselves this year at this time, which will help put that backlog out even further. But I'm very comfortable kind at the 18-month point right now. And we're selling the mix of aircraft. I mentioned this was a great orders quarter for us, the mix of aircraft covered the spectrum of all of them, really, but almost equally weighted in the 450, 550, 650, 280, and a little lighter on the 150. So that's a good story as far as I'm concerned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that it's taking longer for deals to close in the global environment, it's a little bit different. I mean, can you give some color on that, right, because I guess globally corporate profits are pretty good, right? And it seems like North America is getting a little bit better. If you can just give some more detail maybe just around the broad business jet environment.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I mean, North America has been very -- is very strong this year. And we're at about -- let me, okay, we're at about 59%, I believe I said, of the backlog for this year-to-date is North American. So the pent-up demand in North America is being serviced. Within that, I should add, consistent with earlier comments I've made, that the Fortune 500, as part of that, is back, which is, I think, very good for everyone. We are seeing internationally, if you look at the whole backlog, backlog writ large, it's still about 60% international, okay? I was talking about 2012's inject into that. 60% international, but it's fair to say that we're seeing, not surprisingly, less activity in Europe and less activity in Asia Pacific believing that to be, frankly, I think, tied to things like the government transition in China and just some slowness in bringing orders to the fore. We anticipate, as I said in my remarks, getting several multi-aircraft orders out of the international space in the coming months. So the dialogue and the interest level is still there. It's the translation into orders that's not occurring. And as I think, maybe we mentioned in the last call, there's also -- in the financing world, there seems to be more of a requirement, if you're going to finance your aircraft, that you have to get the financing locked in before you order the aircraft, which wasn't the case in earlier times. So that's going to -- those are the big points.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then can I ask just a follow-on, on defense, if that's okay. When you look at the current budget environment and all the uncertainty, I mean, maybe I'll put you on the spot, right? What do you think the odds of sequestration actually playing through are? And I mean, how do you think about that when you plan for the company?","Jay L. Johnson","I wouldn't even place that bet with your money, Ron. You just -- I mean, there is no one on earth who can answer that question with any precision right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, there's a lot of activity and chatter and handwringing and concern and angst, you pick the word, but until we sit down as a government and decide we're going to solve this before the 2nd of January, 2013, it's the law of the land, and it will execute. So planning for that is very difficult, as I mentioned. So our team, I'm sure, is working with Phebe to develop the plan for 2013 based on all the information we have at our disposal. And then you have to be prepared, I think, to be able to stay agile enough to re-cock if you have to. And what that means right now, nobody really knows. So you've heard me talking, I think I said it in my remarks this morning, it's still about, for us, you prepare for that strange outcome that nobody can define just a few months ahead by staying agile, staying lean, cutting cost and not losing your discipline in terms of your ability to execute. And then you're as prepared as anybody can be, and that's what we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jay, best of luck to you as well. One question on -- just a clarification, and then one on the IS&T business. On the clarification point, the guidance, I just want to make sure, includes the charge that you took in IS&T this quarter?","Jay L. Johnson","Affirmative.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm sorry?","Jay L. Johnson","That's affirmative.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on IS&T, lots of commentary here, the charge being related to a specific program, you also made some commentary about maybe you need some changing strategy or approach to the IS&T business. Can you just give us a sense of whether this changing strategy is going to have an impact on revenues as well as margins? Because it sounds like, from a margin perspective, it's going to have a positive impact, but the revenue outlook on this kind of changing tack wasn't quite as clear.","Jay L. Johnson","Well, the write-down didn't have to do with a specific program, if that's what you're alluding to. I mean it was -- we're moving out of that commoditized, ruggedized computer business and putting our efforts where it makes more sense for our customers right now. That was a business that was driven by price with lots of big competitors and frankly, it's not a space we need to stay in. That's what that was all about. The top line impact of all of that, I think, been reflected in our results over the last year or so. So I don't see any strategic shift other than what I've just described there.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So what was the revenue run rate of that business that you're now exiting?","Jay L. Johnson","We don't even -- I don't even break it down that way.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, so not material.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jay, on the Aerospace margins, I hear you on the lumpiness of the R&D. It strikes me that, that's probably lumpiness of the offsetting supplier contributions rather than your engineering spend. And so...","Jay L. Johnson","That's affirmative. That is correct, Joe.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so the question is, since that's probably fairly predictable, it's contractual, and you have your R&D plan set looking forward, can you give some color on the profile, is it going to look more like Q2 or more like Q3? Have we ended some chain of payments, or any kind of color you can provide on that?","Jay L. Johnson","I'm smiling because I wish it were so in terms of the predictability of the supplier launch assistance, as we call it, but it isn't really that predictable. So I don't have a stream I can give you except to say that our R&D investment is, as you well know, is constant and committed, and they feed into that at varying intervals and we just saw 2 big lumps, the comparators this time. But I don't have a stream out ahead of me that I can describe for you today. There will be more, obviously, as we go, and we're always in product development. So targeting 2% to 3% of Gulfstream sales and -- as our benchmark.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that's for a net R&D?","Jay L. Johnson","Affirmative.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the 550, 450 rate, you're at the lower end of your -- but confident, like you say, in orders coming. If those orders don't come, would there be any consideration to lowering that rate of 80 aircraft? Or are you just lock set, no problem at all for 2013 right now?","Jay L. Johnson","No. Well, first of all, we haven't -- we're not giving 2013 guidance. But in general terms to your point, we're not going to keep producing airplanes if we don't have the demand for them. I mean, we believe the demand will be there, and so we rate to that. But we don't keep the rate going if the demand isn't there. So but I'm very confident in both the 450 and the 550. I'd say 2013 looks pretty good. I'm just not prepared, and it's not fair, frankly, to Phebe, for me to say, Well, here's what I think it's going to be in numbers. We're just not there yet. But I anticipate -- when I listen to the earnings call next time, I anticipate hearing that the Gulfstream projection is a good one.","Amy  Gilliland","And I think we have time for just one more question this morning.","Operator","Okay, thank you, Amy. Our final question, then, comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Jay, I'm going to add my sentiments for good luck to you as well. A question I have is on IS&T. I was wondering if you could give us some -- flesh out a bit kind of the color that you're seeing on contract terms and margin outlook? And how should we think about the trends that you see emerging ahead sort  of division by division, if you don't mind, putting a finer point on it. Just again, I know you don't want to provide guidance, but just so we can kind of think about it looking ahead, most competitively vulnerable division that you have?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, let's take a whack at it this way, Heidi. We've got -- the most impact we're seeing right now is in the short cycle businesses, a.k.a. IS&T. That's a blinding flash of the obvious. But in point of fact, within that, you recall earlier discussions, we talked about the mix within IS&T, and the service mix has increased from, my memory thinks maybe it was in the 20%, 20s back some couple 3 years ago is now almost half of IS&T's business. So there's a margin reality that's attached to that. Oh, by the way, our IS&T folks in that space have done a tremendous job of executing at good profitability. But that's a reality that's there, okay? There's more service work. The tactical communications business, which is significant for us, most out of our C4 Systems business, I alluded to it I think once or twice in my remarks, but what we're seeing there now, all of a -- not all of a sudden, we're finally getting the volume coming back to us, but the mix within that volume is less on the higher margin encryption type products and more on more moderate margin things. But we do have the franchise programs in there. WIN-T and JTRS, which have taken perhaps longer than originally anticipated. But in both cases, those franchise programs are building now and, within the next year, will build even further. So we're very encouraged for that, and that will be significant business going forward for C4 Systems, but for IS&T and General Dynamics. So we've had -- we've seen award delays, I've talked about that. We've seen descoping. We've seen a lot of the lowest price technically acceptable, which is, in Jay Johnson's opinion, not very helpful to anybody in the long term, but -- and then we've seen increased competition. So those are all factors that are upon the IS&T world. The long-term view for IS&T, for us, is a very healthy one. They are just a short-cycle business, the most impacted by kind of where we are in the world right now, dealing with what's right ahead of us in the next 6 months.","Amy  Gilliland","And thank you for joining our call today.

My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations. And you have the floor, ma'am.","Amy  Gilliland","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter conference call.","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.","Jay L. Johnson","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter delivered $7.9 billion in sales and $970 million in operating earnings at a 12.2% operating margin, improvement from last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter.","Earnings per share totaled $1.77 on a fully diluted basis, $0.20 ahead of last quarter.","Second quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, totaled $703 million or 111% of earnings from continuing operations. This result was particularly strong, considering that it includes approximately $100 million in pension fund contribution, 2 quarterly federal tax payments and continued investment in Gulfstream's Savannah campus. We plan to contribute about $500 million in total to our pension plans this year with most of the remainder in the third quarter.","Year-to-date, free cash flow is $1 billion or 86% of earnings from continuing operations.","On the capital deployment front, we took advantage of our healthy balance sheet and tough market conditions to repurchase 7.8 million shares of common stock this quarter. Through the first half, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares.","Additionally, we had announced the acquisition of IPWireless, an excellent bolt-on addition for our IS&T business. IPWireless further expands our technical communications portfolio into the public safety first responder market with advanced broadband technology that improves first responders'  effectiveness and safety by providing them with greater access to information.","Orders this quarter were approximately $5.2 billion, reflecting continued sluggishness in defense award activity and some slower-than-anticipated order timing in Aerospace. I do anticipate improved second-half orders, particularly in Aerospace.","At the end of the quarter, funded backlog was $43.9 billion while total backlog stood at $52.4 billion. Total estimated contract value, which includes opportunities to provide products and services under IDIQ contracts and options, was $78.6 billion.","Before I turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, I want to comment on what we are seeing in this dynamic aerospace and defense business environment. In our U.S. defense market, visibility remains somewhat limited by 3 principal factors: the upcoming elections, a likely 2013 continuing resolution and the sequestration trigger.","The uncertainty and anxiety spawned by these second-half events continues to impede Department of Defense and federal government acquisition program execution. As was the case last quarter, our shorter-cycle IS&T business is experiencing the most pressure, due primarily to award delays on several of our key tactical communications contracts. In most cases, these are funded programs of record. While there are -- excuse me, while there was improvement in activity from first to second quarter, this order activity did not meet our expectations.","As anticipated, we are witnessing increased rhetoric as the summer progresses and the political process prepares to navigate the final months of the campaign trail.","As we steam towards the sequestration fogbank, many members of Congress have begun talking more seriously about sequestration and its potential impacts. We remain hopeful that a bipartisan solution can be brokered. However, as a practical matter, it seems increasingly unlikely that we will see additional detail on implementation or resolution before the November elections.","We are focused on what we can control. Specifically, we're executing on our backlog; working with our customers to jump-start the expenditure of previously appropriated funds; talking with our suppliers; analyzing our contract terms and conditions; and judiciously husbanding our capital resources. Nevertheless, forecasting our customer's behavior has become increasingly difficult.","Given this uncertainty, we have adjusted our expectations somewhat for the year. Our outlook does assume the obligation of previously appropriated funds on several of our programs where delays have been prominent. With that said, the 2013 defense budget request is proceeding through the congressional approval process. We've been pleased with the support our programs have received to date. In the likely event that the 2013 Pentagon budget is funded, at least for some period of time through a continuing resolution, our programs would reflect relatively healthy 2012 funding levels.","In our Aerospace group, Gulfstream continues to enjoy a sizable, multi-year large cabin backlog in a robust order pipeline. The fidelity of our backlog is evidenced by the extremely limited default of activity this quarter. And point of fact, this was the lowest default quarter since the economic downturn began in 2008. We are seeing, however, some elongation of our business jet order cycle with a number of factors causing deal closure times to increase. In part, order delays, most of which materialize late in the quarter, reflect the decline in global economic sentiment.","We continue to believe that we will realize many of these orders although their timing, and in some cases, their scope, may vary from initial discussions.","Now let me turn to each of our groups, starting with Combat Systems.","Combat Systems' sales and earnings improved this quarter when compared with last quarter and the second of 2011. Sales totaled $2.15 billion, reflecting growing FMS volume for vehicles and tanks, initial progress on the Ground Combat Vehicle program and the addition of Force Protection.  Abrams tank volume and European Land Systems volume were down somewhat as expected. The group's earnings were $322 million, resulting in 15% operating margins. This operating margin reflects excellent performance across Combats' portfolio of mature domestic vehicle production programs. In addition, profitability continues to be enhanced by ongoing continuous improvement and business optimization initiatives.","Combat Systems backlog totaled $9.8 billion at quarter end. Although the group's orders improved from last quarter, orders in Combats' weapon systems and European vehicles segments were somewhat lighter than anticipated due to several international program delays. Notable orders that were received included approximately $270 million for Hydra rockets, $170 million for Abrams upgrades and support, and $115 million for Stryker double-V-hull conversions and logistics support.","The Stryker double-V-hull conversion order is particularly significant as it reaffirms the customer's acceptance of the life-saving benefit of the double-V-hull and begins the process of converting another brigade of Strykers to the double-V configuration.","In the second half, we expect order activity to improve with additional awards for Strykers, MRAP enhancements and international tank upgrades for several Middle Eastern customers to include 200 tanks from Morocco.","We also expect a significant Abrams award that will fund tank research and development activities over the next several years. This investment is proof of our customer's long-term commitment to investing in and modernizing this integral component of the Army's fighting force.","The Abrams tank also continues to receive staunch congressional support with each of the 3 committees that is marked, thus far, adding funds to sustain Abrams production. This support will help ensure that the U.S. maintains a healthy and reliable tank industrial base.","Combat is on track to achieve my guidance of around $8.5 billion in sales this year. A variety of drivers in our European Land Systems business including reduced profitability on several vehicle programs, delays in several international awards, and absorption impact from lower-than-anticipated volume will cause the group's earnings to be somewhat lower than anticipated. Consequently, the group's operating margins will likely be closer to the mid-13% range.","Next, Marine Systems. Marine Systems delivered another very solid quarter. Sales and earnings at $1.7 billion and $183 million, respectively, were up for the group collectively and at all 3 shipyards when compared with the prior year periods. Marine's stronger sales performance reflects higher submarine and destroyer volume, partially offset by lower T-AKE volume when compared with last year's second quarter.","The group's repair-related sales also increased in the quarter, due primarily to our third quarter 2011 acquisition of Norfolk-based Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO-Norfolk. Integration of this acquisition is going well, and we continue to be excited about naval ship repair opportunities.","In order to better leverage this growth market, in the second quarter, we announced our intent to acquire the Ship Repair and Coatings Divisions of Earl Industries. Earl will provide General Dynamics a role as prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier, multi-ship, multi-option contracts, MSMOs; further enhance our ability to deliver cost-effective repair and maintenance service on both coasts; and extend the reach of our repair capabilities in the 2 major East Coast Navy ports, Norfolk and Mayport.","Group margins in the quarter improved 90 basis points over last year's second quarter to 11.1%, driven primarily by strong performance on the T-AKE program.","Our 3 shipyards were busy delivering ships to our Navy customers in the second quarter including T-AKE 13; the USNS Medgar Evers; DDG 112; USS Michael Murphy, the final ship in the original DDG 51 program; and SSN 782, the USS Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine.","The group's backlog was $17 billion at quarter end including several key new orders such as a $65 million contract to provide planning yard services for DDG 51 class destroyers and FFG 7 class frigates and the $80 million contract to purchase long lead materials for the next block, Block IV, of 9 Virginia-class submarines.","We are currently preparing our bid for Block IV, expected later this -- next year, excuse me, and the SSBN replacement program design contract, which should be awarded by year end. We also recently submitted our bid for the Navy's DDG 51 multiyear program. This 9-ship contract, which includes an option for a 10th ship, is expected to be awarded early next year.","Other opportunities for the group include additional repair work and the potential for some Jones Act commercial ships.","Overall, 2012 sales should be modestly below 2011, consistent with my prior guidance. Given the group's performance through the first half, Marine margins for the year should be in the low 11% range, somewhat better than my earlier guidance.","Now to IS&T. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our IS&T group was challenged again in the second quarter as customer award activity continued to fall short of expectations. Group sales were $2.5 billion while earnings were $226 million, up modestly from first quarter but off slightly from our expectations.","Similar to the first quarter, volume weakness was driven by shortfalls in our tactical communications business. Last quarter, I highlighted the 3 areas which were causing weakness in our communications business. Award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; a slower-than-anticipated transition to the Common Hardware Systems-4 program; and the sluggish ramp in several programs moving from development to production, most notably JTRS and WIN-T.","We made some progress on encryption orders in the second quarter, although we did not completely meet our forecast. We do expect good third quarter encryption volume, particularly as the government's fourth physical -- fiscal quarter has historically been a strong award period for our short-cycle products.","The CHS-4 program was again a driver of the group's volume weakness in the second quarter, although improved somewhat from the first quarter. As a reminder, this is a $3.7 billion, 5-year single-source IDIQ contract that purchases from across the military and other government agencies and used to acquire the latest ruggedized commercial computing and communications technology. Slowing operational tempo has impacted demand when compared with the prior contracts. However, current customer demand far outpaces the orders we have received year-to-date. We have lowered our full year expectations for this contract, but believe that orders will improve somewhat in the second half.","On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continued to demonstrate their capability in the quarter, including participating in the Army's recent Network Integration Evaluation. While test reports are still preliminary, we have every reason to believe that our HMS Manpack and WIN-T Increment 2 products performed extremely well.","Similarly, our HMS Rifleman radio received Pentagon approval for procurement of another 13,000 radios. Despite the demonstrated success and progress of our programs, the obligation of funding and awards for these programs continues to fall behind program or record time line. We are working closely with our customer on these issues and continue to expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios in the second half.","Volume in our IT service business was essentially flat this quarter as the addition of several businesses in 2011 offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects, which have concluded.","IS&T operating margins were 8.9% in the second quarter. This result reflects the lack of award activity in our higher-return, product-oriented tactical communications business and the overall portfolio mix shift toward service work that I mentioned in the first quarter call.","IS&T, like the rest of our businesses, remain focused on profitability and competitiveness. The group continues to be aggressive in targeting costs to include facility consolidations, restructuring a business unit and staffing reductions. These actions should afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.","The group's backlog totaled $9.3 billion at the quarter end while total estimated contract value, which includes backlog and potential IDIQ awards totaled $31 billion. Order activity was particularly healthy at our IT services business this quarter with several new opportunities captured to serve a wide range of customers including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and NATO.","Even amidst a slower order cadence, our tactical communications business captured several key adjacent market wins including a $365 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the FAA's air-to-ground radios and a $385 million 10-year IDIQ contract to replace the Army's outdated fleet of range radar systems. These wins diversify our tactical communications end markets moving forward and highlight our focus on seeking new opportunities where we can apply our core competencies.","IS&T's proposal activity remains quite robust, and we are maintaining our new capture rates. While forecasting remains extremely challenging in this market, we anticipate book-to-bill to improve in the second half and full year book-to-bill to approximate 1x.","In light of the group's first half results, I expect full year sales to be down 7% when compared with last year. This revised outlook, which assumes just over $500 million of incremental volume in the second half, reflects the realities we experienced in the first half and our best estimate of how our customers will behave in the second half. Most of the incremental volume will come from our IST -- excuse me, our IT services business, including a significant portion that is in backlog today. As tactical communications volume improves in the second half, I would expect margins to expand from the 9% level achieved in the first half to yield full year group margins around 9.3%.","Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group's second quarter sales were $1.6 billion, up 16% from the year ago quarter, due primarily to green G650 deliveries. When compared with the first quarter, revenues were down modestly due to the timing of several large-cabin aircraft deliveries.","Earnings totaled $257 million, resulting in a 16.1% group operating margin. The group's operating margins improved 90 basis points when compared with last year's period, due to both improved results at Jet Aviation and excellent performance at Gulfstream. A variety of factors including mix and rightsizing actions taken at Jet caused margins to contract 60 basis points sequentially.","Jet Aviation continues to make positive progress. In the quarter, we delivered the remaining 2 narrow-body wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. And in an effort to continue improving its competitiveness, Jet reorganized its Basel operations, which resulted in further employee reductions. The Jet leadership team remains focused on capturing new completions opportunities.","Jet's service operations continue to do well to include modest volume improvement from the year ago period and flat revenues sequentially. This performance reflects the dichotomy of increased demand across some markets, such as Asia, and decreased maintenance repair demand in Europe as the region copes with continued economic uncertainty.","We've taken a hard look at our European service operations and are taking appropriate actions to reshape that footprint.","As we look forward, Jet's global service footprint remains a strategic advantage for our Aerospace group. In the very near term, Jet's London Biggin Hill FBO, the closest business aviation airport to the Olympic Park, has already seen an increase in traffic from visitors to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.","Broader aerospace market indicators were mixed this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, orders were softer than expected due to the timing with second quarter gross new aircraft book-to-bill at 0.6x on a dollar-denominated basis. When combined with continued G650 deliveries, this elongation of the order cycle caused the group's backlog to decline to approximately $16.3 billion. While lower, this healthy backlog continues to keep us in an 18- to 24-month delivery window for our G450 and G550 products, and G650 backlog remains approximately 5 years in duration. As I've mentioned previously, because new orders for the G650 currently have this 5-year entry into service date, we do not expect new orders to match planned deliveries the near term.","Through the first half, orders reflect the relative resilience of the large-cabin market when compared with mid-cabin. North American customers comprised 60% of the order book year-to-date, reflecting the return of some of our North American customers and some cooling of international demand, particularly in Asia. Gulfstream flying hours were at prerecession levels, pretty healthy, consistent with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Bellstream and Jet Aviation services are up almost 5%. We continue to work diligently to ensure that our service network remains well-positioned to serve customers in the growing install global fleet.","In pursuit of this goal, we continue to improve our Field and Airborne Support Teams, our FAST teams. These teams, which were created a decade ago to provide 24\/7 customer service support, just celebrated their 3,000 mission flight. In the quarter, we announced the addition of mobile maintenance vehicles to the FAST capability set. These vehicles will provide a range of services to customers in targeted markets.","Preowned aircraft on the market continued to slowly decline in the quarter. We had 1 aircraft in inventory at the beginning of this quarter, took 1 additional preowned in trade during the quarter and had both aircraft available for sale at quarter end.","On the product development front, the G650 and G280 development programs continued to make progress in the second quarter. Both aircraft set city-pair records en route to EBACE in Geneva in May. The G280 has now completed all of its FAA flying and we're working through the final stages of certification. We are nearly complete with the FAA's required G650 flight testing and remain on track to obtain a third quarter type certification.","We continue to believe that we can attain our objective of delivering about 24 green G650 aircraft this year and around 17 completions with most of these completions happening in the fourth quarter.","For the year, I expect the group sales to grow approximately 15% in line with my prior guidance, as large- and mid-cabin in-production green deliveries plan for the year remain on track at just over 100 and 10 to 15, respectively. Margins will be in the mid-15% range, somewhat higher than previously expected given Gulfstream's strong performance through the first half.","In summary, General Dynamics executed very well this quarter and I expect that performance to continue in the second half. However, given first half results and the difficult reality of forecasting for IS&T in this uncertain period, I'm adjusting my EPS range to $7 to $7.10. As is our practice, this guidance does not presume further deployment of capital.","We have a lot of work to accomplish in the second half as we deal with the defense uncertainties before us, achieve G650 and G280 type certification and begin detailed planning for 2013. With these tasks ahead, Phebe Novakovic, who, as you know, will assume my role as Chairman and CEO at the beginning of next year, is concentrating her efforts on the operation of this corporation and our 2013 planning process.","Amidst this decidedly dynamic business climate, all of us at General Dynamics remain laser-focused on the things we can control and on doing what we do best: executing.","And with that, I'll ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?","L. Hugh Redd","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Really just 3 quick points before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $37 million for the quarter versus $31 million in 2011. For 2012, we expect net interest expense of approximately $155 million, reflecting the full year impact of our fixed rate notes issued in July of 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $1 billion of net debt.","Second, I'd like to point out an item impacting the comparability of our results, that being the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011. This sale resulted in a pretax gain of $38 million or about $0.07 in other income.","Finally, the effective tax rate was 31.5% for the first 6 months compared with 30.8% for the same period in 2011.","For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 amount, but due primarily to the absence of the R&D tax credit for 2012 but also due to less income from international locations where the tax rates are lower.","Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the question-and-answer.","Amy  Gilliland","[Operator Instructions]  Jeff, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jay, your comments on the second half of book-to-bill improvement that you expect in Aerospace, can you give a little more color as to the level of confidence there in terms of you're seeing more pre-order traffic or kicking the tires, and specifically what regions are showing that pickup? And then kind of as a caveat to that, you -- at least I interpreted that there were some, I'm not sure, it's process procedural delays maybe in the quarter in terms of orders getting over the finish line, if you can clarify that a little bit?","Jay L. Johnson","Okay, be happy to. We did -- let me say it this way. We believe the second-half order activity will be stronger, as I said in my remarks. Example, let me just talk to demographics: 60% of our first quarter -- our first-half orders came from North America. Within that set, we had several, shall we say, multi-aircraft fleet buys, if you will, that moved out of the quarter; not off the page, just out of the quarter. And we anticipate those to be with us in the order book before the end of the year. And really, that probably had as much to do with North America with the order circumstance, if you will, as anything. So last year, just to further comment on North America, last year, at the midyear, about 28% as I recall, of our orders were North American. And as I said before, 60% this year. So the North American market, at large, is becoming a bigger part of our order book, which we like a lot. Conversely, we saw great softness in Europe, not unexpected by anyone and some in Asia, which frankly, we attribute at this stage more to timing than anything. What does that mean? That means, this year -- I don't have the exact percentage in my head, but last year's midyear order book was like 49% Asia Pacific and this year it was down in the high teens, as I recall. So there has been some cooling, as I said in my remarks. But again, we had a lot of fleet activity last year that hasn't manifested itself yet this year, but because of ongoing discussions, et cetera, we have -- we believe that there will be more activity coming out of Asia in the second half is probably the cleanest way to say it.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you think it's enough to make book-to-bill 1 for the second half?","Jay L. Johnson","Probably not. Remember, too, Myles, in my -- as I said in my remarks, the 1:1 book-to-bill is going to be challenged right now because we're working off the 650 backlog. So I look, primarily, at what my delivery window is and I'm still very comfortable today in the 18- to 24-month for the 450 and the 550, and as I said, well out in excess of that for the 650. So I think that answers your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jay, I wanted to ask you 2 questions on 2 specific programs. First, I wondered if you might speak to why you think Textron won the TAPV program. And then secondly, following up on your IS&T technical comments, can you elaborate on WIN-T? Is there anything materially unexpected or sort of out of line on that program going on?","Jay L. Johnson","Okay. I don't really have a comment on TAPV, Noah. I don't know, I mean. But I wish them well and I would say that we are in the hunt to compete for the CCV and we're already in execution on $1 billion of the LAV III upgrades with the Canadian DND so we've got plenty work to do, and we see more work out ahead. In terms of WIN-T, look, it's the stated #1 priority for our Army customer. So in macro terms, we feel very good about WIN-T and the performance of our pieces based on the NIE 12.2 are very encouraging. So it's back to my T word -- my T word, which is timing and we anticipate getting awards in the second half of this year. We just don't have them yet, okay? We expect a full rate production decision, I think, it's in September, either late August or September. So best we can tell that's still on track, but it hasn't, obviously, come yet. But we are very pleased and I believe the Army customer is very pleased with the performance of our pieces of WIN-T.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Have there been any design or specification issues with any other contributors to the program? Just trying to discern why this is getting held up.","Jay L. Johnson","None that I'm aware of. Honestly, I -- and I may be -- I don't want to presume to speak for the Army customer here, but maybe I will a little bit and my -- I'll just give you my impression of some of this, is that they're trying to align all of these programs, WIN-T and JTRS, into the NIE sequence and those don\u2019t happen but every so often. So I think, honestly, that's caused some of the delay in some of the award activity. That's the best -- my best sense of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Jay, just a question on the Aerospace and business jets. I just wanted to know -- you noted some pretty strong pricing previously. I just want to know if you could discuss maybe pricing for large-cabin and mid-cabin jets, especially since you're thinking about stronger order activity in the second half?","Jay L. Johnson","The way I characterize it, Rich, is that the large-cabin pricing is very resilient and the mid-cabin pricing, I think this is industry-wide, is very competitive, and shall we say, less resilient.","Operator","Our your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a question on IS&T. Just thinking about kind of the different buckets that you're involved in. I know that you've commented on the delays within some of the products in the networking area. What are you seeing -- I mean on the services front, we've seen a lot of delays. Can you bucket it in terms of the customer mix, DoD or intel or is it all across-the-board within civil agencies also?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, our services business has been -- they've done pretty well in what I consider a really tough environment. Good award activity in the quarter, I think I mentioned that, but -- and we've got probably about -- I think I've got about 45% to 47% of our IS&T sales are coming out of services now. About 21 or 22% of that out of what I call pure IT services and then probably another 25% coming out of engineering services, but that segment has been pressured for 18 to 24 months now. But I'd say, as I started this answer, again, we're competing very well in a tough environment. We are seeing some of the awards move to the right. We are seeing some down-scoping or re-scoping of those awards, but we're maintaining our capture rates and I think we're very competitive. You've got, in addition to that, the lowest-priced technically acceptable reality, which I think we've talked about before that's out there, that puts a lot of pressure on the system. So in a pretty decent catfight, I think our IT services business is doing very well.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes. Do you need -- I know that you had presence in all 50 states and certainly internationally on the footprint side. Are there consolidation opportunities there to help preserve the margins?","Jay L. Johnson","Sure, sure. They're looking at that all, in doing that, all of them. It's interesting, the consolidations and the re-scoping and the reshaping that I mentioned in my remarks, I mean that is a reality across all of our businesses right now as they deal with the realities of the defense market that has taken a $487 billion reduction across the 10 years and that doesn't even get into the sequestration discussion, so that's just good business. So as I've always said, we manage for profitability. We are doing that right now in all of these businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just talk for -- about Gulfstream for 2 seconds. One is can you give us a sense what's left in terms of the challenges for the 650 cert and then also just talk a little bit about the service business, you did talk about all the expansion. How -- what kind of growth rate are you seeing?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, okay. Howard, thanks. The 650 certification, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're getting very close to completion of the flight test activity. That'll conclude here very shortly. Once that occurs, then it becomes a matter of putting it all together, my word, not probably the proper word, administratively, if you will, in laying all that out and then getting with -- working with the FAA to get yourself to an agreed-upon time to execute the type certification. We're on track for that. I have no indication that we're not. So I'm getting excited about it actually. I try to throttle myself back, but that's on track. Once that happens and as that happens, okay, once the flying's done, then we'll -- they'll start training the crews for the aircraft to be delivered, et cetera, as we had talked before. And you'll see then entry into service within a matter, I should think, of weeks after the type certification occurs. So we're marching down that time line very aggressively and visibly, I would add. They're doing lots of flying right now, but we're almost done with it. The service business, Howard, I mentioned, I think, the service business was up like up 5% for the first half. I would expect it to probably stay kind of flat for the rest of the year. I don't -- and why do I say that? Because the lack of activity, for example, that we're seeing in Europe right now, I don't see that getting any better for the rest of the year. It's causing us to have to reshape our European business somewhat at Jet, as I mentioned earlier. So the service business is doing fine, but I don't expect it to outperform the first half in the second half. I'd love to be pleasantly surprised on that, but I just don't see it right now. And we measure that in lots of different ways, not the least of which is looking at what visibility our service centers have on their order books and it's still pretty close aboard. Not a lot of long-term appointments for discretionary repair and upgrade. So it's still a very strong business for us, but I don't see much more than flat for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with Lazard Capital.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you help us understand order flow a bit better? Where do bids submitted, pending approval, currently stand? And can you give us the mix of recompetes versus new opportunities in that number? And then finally, as we look out over, say, the next 6 months, what does -- what do you plan to submit to -- on new contracts?","Jay L. Johnson","Wow. Let me just put it in macro terms, Mike. I mean in IS&T space, as you know, we have thousands of contracts in the year. I would characterize the order activity as being quite healthy actually, okay? We don't quantify it inside of that because it's just, like I've said, they're just flat; too many moving parts. But we anticipate the funnel is still there and the funnel will need to get serviced. So as I said earlier, the order activity in IS&T, we anticipate to be fairly respectful and ending the year at probably 1x, which it needs to do. And you know in that short cycle business, they got to turn inside themselves at least inside the year. So that part is good. Where we're seeing the challenge right now, as I've mentioned, is in the actual converting that into -- converting orders into sales and execution, and we're working very hard with our customers to get the appropriated funds obligated and to execute the 2012 plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You sort of just touched on this, but what I was going to ask you is what level of bookings you need across the 3 segments, understanding that some are longer-cycle than others, in order to meet your targeted guidance for the year?  I'm thinking about the third quarter, specifically, since no one knows what the fourth quarter is going to do.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think I expect Combats' bookings to improve. I think I may have mentioned that. Marine, not much, but remember -- remember, Marine is very lumpy. So we'll get Marine orders in big slugs. We'll work them off, which we're doing right now and then we'll get another big slug. I'm not worried in the least about Marine. And then IS&T, as I said, it's got to turn itself inside the year and we anticipate, based on the funnel we see out there, still being close to 1:1 for the year. So I think -- I hope that's responsive.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, Jay, one other thing. Do I detect a shift towards service in the Marine business with the recent acquisitions? Is that a strategic thing that you're doing given the long-term outlook on production?","Jay L. Johnson","I wouldn't say it's a switch to service. I would say that we're adding service to a very robust platform portfolio, and the repair business is a wonderful thing to be in for the United States Navy with its global fleet. So we're trying to enhance our repair opportunities and I'd love to keep -- we will keep doing that, but it's not at the expense of because we've got 3 shipyards that are going to be very busy for as far as I can see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jonathan Raviv","This is actually Jon Raviv in for Jason. Just a quick question on cash deployment priorities, looking at dividends, buybacks, M&A -- where your priorities are given the current environment? And then just on the M&A question, where your M&A priorities might be? I know we've seen some defense acquisitions of late, perhaps there's some commercial opportunities on the horizon as well?","Jay L. Johnson","Okay. Thanks, Jon. We always pouch our capital deployment in terms of balance and I'm certainly not about to change that. I would caveat it, however, by suggesting that as you look at the rest of this year and you look at, the term we're using, the fogbank, is now ahead of us in terms of the sequester: how it's going to be dealt with, what the CR is really going to translate to, how all that gets dealt with here in the next 6 months. I would suggest that capital deployment would be dealt with very cautiously and that's certainly what our intent is here. I would rather keep it in my quiver right now and that's kind of where we are. Now there aren't a lot of M&A opportunities of large and I don't see any of really large scale out there. There are some and we've -- I just talked about one of them, that we took advantage of, in IPWireless. I just talked about another one in Earl Industries. Those good opportunities to add to our portfolio will still be out there and we would take advantage of such opportunities. But I think the operative word, certainly into next year in capital deployment, is caution and maintain your balance and keep the quiver as full as you can.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jay, I thought maybe I'd ask a bigger picture question on the Marine side. When you look at the ops tempo, clearly the Navy is small for the missions being asked of it. You've got the Navy stretched thin over Central Command and at the same time being asked to cover significant areas in the Pacific Command. The pivot to the Pacific has been long in the making, but I don't think anyone foresaw how much the Navy would be tasked over Central Command. So it's clear that the Navy budget faces real strain in terms of the needs for more ships. And I'm just wondering if you could give us color on what kind of discussions you're having with your Navy as they wrangle with solving this problem. Is there kind of examination into, basically, maybe buying more lower-cost surface combatants? Or the Virginia-class sub was supposed to be a low-cost sub; could they downsize yet again and develop less costly subs? Can you maybe add some vibrancy to kind of how you're working with the customer kind of wrestle with this?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, I mean we've had this discussion before in the context of even before the Pacific pivot was announced. I mean, we are global Navy. Over 90% of the world's commerce moves by sea, by volume, as I recall. I don't think that will change, certainly not anytime soon. And with that as a reality, United States Navy must maintain a robust force structure. That robust force structure must include lots of ships. And as I've said before, presence really does make a difference, and so you have to be there particularly when you're dealing now with the realities in the Pacific where the tyranny of distance causes you to be unable to be in multiple places at the same time very easily. So all that bodes well when you're a Navy shipbuilder for your future opportunities. As to your comment about the Virginia-class, the Virginia-class submarine in that program, itself, is what I would call as close to a model program as the Department of Defense has and we're very proud of that and we bring those boats in at the price tag that was -- I think, the public price tag is like $2 billion a boat. In point of fact, we delivered the Mississippi $60 million under budget and a year early, so we know how to build Virginia-class submarines. There is no substitute for the Virginia-class submarine in my humble opinion, and I don't think the Navy would argue with that. We need them in number, that's why Block IV will become a reality and there'll probably be a Block V after that. So the customer is looking at costs all the time on things like SSBN(NYSE:X), but we still must have a fleet of major platforms. LCS will have its role, but we're still going to be making -- manufacturing lots of, in Jay Johnson's humble opinion and I think the Navy would agree, lots of major surface combatants, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines and the auxiliaries that will be needed to service them around the globe. That will not change.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And you said you're not the least worried about Marine. Does that mean that the second sub and the second destroyer in FY '13 will be executable? And lastly, if you don't mind me squishing this in, Jay, there's some smaller ships that are clearly struggling and I just wondered if you could touch on whether that creates some M&A opportunities for you?","Jay L. Johnson","On the last, I'm not particularly looking at any of that. On the smaller ship side, I think I know what you're talking about, but we've got plenty of work right now with the platforms we have. And the second submarine and the second DDG, I think the Navy and everyone is working very hard to keep that rate as the reality because it's the most cost-efficient and smartest move for everybody. So we're confident there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So a kind of 2-point question on profitability at Gulfstream. The first part is you did 16.1% close to the first quarter, even though forfeitures were down and you had the problems at Jet. How come? And secondly, you had said that G650 should have above-average margins. Given that volume will be up in the second half, presumably with the G650s in your guidance, how come the margins aren't better in the second half?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, they are better than I guided to earlier, Cai, but I would say I'm being a little bit conservative here. I've got a product mix at Gulfstream. We delivered, I think, like 4 of the mid-cabins in the first half so we're going to be delivering more of the mid-cabins in the second half and -- so I'm at the mid-15s right now. And as is usually the case, I'm hopeful they'll outperform that. But we've got Jet, you touched on it, but if you compare it to the first half -- first quarter, I'm sorry, we've got, I think, we were down like 60 basis points. But a lot of that had to do with timing from Jet absorption expenses related to their resizing effort, which I touched on but didn't really elaborate. They are on track to be about break-even for the year, but they've got a lot -- they had a lot to take out here in the first half.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But isn't that even if Jet is going to do better in the second half, you have more 650s, you basically -- your volume on the mid-sized given the price differential just isn't that big. It still looks like, on paper, the margins in the second half should be better than the 16.1%. Are we missing something here?","Jay L. Johnson","No, I don't think so. I'm probably hedging. As I said, I'm being a little conservative with it, Cai, partly because of the restructuring and the market that Jet's seeing in Europe right now and partly because I'm just -- I'm hedging myself a little bit on product support which, as I'd mentioned on an earlier question, is I expect to be flat and that remains to be seen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In Combat Systems, just if I look at that you did about $4 billion in revenues in the first half to get to $8.5 billion for the year, it would certainly imply a stronger second half. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that pickup in that second half? And then just secondly, unrelated, was OT&E recently talked about the HMS Manpack as not being -- performing as well and I just wanted to know if you could comment on that.","Jay L. Johnson","Actually, I think I know on the last what you're referring to, Sam, and that basically is some old news that's already been taken care of. So the Manpack is -- they're quite happy with the Manpack right now. As to the first, it's really -- hit me with it again?","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You did $4 billion in revenues in the first half, you're saying $8.5 billion for the year, so it's got to pick up.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes. Some of that, I think, will have to do with ELS, which we expect to be stronger in the second half than in the first half in Land Systems international programs, which as I'd said, it had some program delay but we expect more pickup in the second half. ELS' and -- I mean Combat Systems has been, historically, rather back-weighted to the year. I don't expect that to change, but I'm quite confident in our $8.5 billion number.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of clarifications. Jay, could you be specific on the number of flight hours or test points or whatever that have been achieved on the 650 versus what's necessary? And then on the IS&T side, looking for margin pickup in the second half, but I thought I heard you say that the services side of the business, which was what you believe is going to provide the incremental revenue pickup and so that would suggest an adverse mix shift. What am I missing there?","Jay L. Johnson","To your last, of the $500 million in incremental that we need to get to where we -- I'm guiding in the second half, 2\/3 to 3\/4 of that comes from IT service. Your point is well taken. The tactical communications piece of that, though, is about 20% to 25% of that. And assuming that happens, which we have every indication that it will, that will give us the margin lift that I talked about. As to your first, I'm not going to get test point-specific. Let's just say that we're down to a very reasonable number of flights that remain and we're on track for the third quarter certification. There's no mystery in any of that, that I'm saying. And quite honestly, I can't remember the precise figure, but I've been tracking it virtually every day or every other day and we're marching down the flight test point, burndown chart quite nicely and I'm very confident that we're going to be wrapping it up very soon here.","Amy  Gilliland","And thank you for joining our call today.

My name is Glenn, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Miss Erin Linnihan. Please proceed.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call.","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Thank you, Erin, and good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a very good third quarter, with revenues of $7.8 billion and net income of $651 million. We reported EPS of $1.84 per diluted share, $0.14 ahead of the year ago quarter and $0.03 better than the second quarter this year. This was also $0.16 per share better than consensus. So how did we get there?","Revenue was 1.7% less than the third quarter 2012. Once again, however, revenue for each of our operating groups was higher than the year ago quarter, except for Combat Systems. The same is true for the first 9 months of the year. Revenue for the first 9 months is up over 2012 in our Aerospace, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups, but offset by a significant decline in Combat Systems revenue, leading the company down 1.4% for the first 9 months.","The real story in the quarter, however, is the positive operating leverage achieved in the period. While revenue was down 1.7%, operating earnings were up 5.7% in the quarter, a clear reflection of positive operating leverage. This resulted in 12.3% overall operating margin.","Net earnings and earnings per share were ahead of Q3 2012 by $51 million and 8.2%, respectively. The ratio of net earnings to revenue or return on sales was 8.4%.","With respect to cash, we had $364 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter, about 56% of net income. We had $1.3 billion for the first 3 quarters, about 69% of net income. In Q3, we repurchased slightly under 1.6 million shares for $134 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased over 9 million shares for $718 million. In addition, if we add that -- if we add to that number the 2 dividends paid this year -- recall that there was no dividend in Q1 because it was paid in the fourth quarter of last year -- we have returned $1.1 billion of the $1.3 billion or 87% of the free cash flow year-to-date to our shareholders.","Let's turn to segment reporting for the quarter. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a better-than-expected quarter with its highest quarterly revenue to date. Compared to third quarter 2012, operating earnings and margins were up $108 million and 290 basis points, respectively. Pretty strong.","On a sequential basis, operating earnings and margins were both somewhat lower, as had been forecasted. Gulfstream margins were good and better than expected, but lower than last quarter for the reasons I provided during the second quarter conference call. Once again, we had good contribution from Jet Aviation, where they were operating at a loss a year ago.","Our expectation in the fourth quarter is that revenues will be approximately the same as this quarter, but margins will not be as good. We will deliver 2 fewer large-cabin aircraft and will experience higher research and development costs with late [ph] scheduled launch assistance payments. We also have some program timing impacts of Jet -- at Jet on completions, all of which will compress margins.","For the year, revenues will be consistent with prior outlook and margins for the group should improve slightly over prior guidance to the low-17% range.","Combat Systems. Combat once again demonstrated the disciplined performance of a good cyclical, reporting 16.4% margin on revenues approximately 30% lower than the year-ago quarter. Land Systems and OTS had particularly strong margins on continuing cost reduction initiatives and strong program performance.","ELS helped by returning to profitability in the quarter despite weak revenues. All in all, a really outstanding performance from an operating perspective.","Compared to the year ago quarter, margins were up 240 basis points. Sequentially, revenue was somewhat lower, but operating margins were up 230 basis points. We do expect significantly higher revenue in the fourth quarter, but a drop in margins in our domestic business.","For the full year, revenues should be 20% lower than last year and margins should be mid-14%, 10% higher than 2012 on a pro forma before charges basis.","Marine group. Marine group revenues were higher than Q3 2012, but operating earnings and operating margins were down $16 million and 110 basis points, respectively, entirely as a result of the completion of the T-AKE program in Q4 2012. Nevertheless, operating earnings were good and operating margins at 10% were solid with good performance across each of our businesses. These are industry-leading margins.","In Q4, we expect lower revenue and some very modest margin compression. For the year, Marine group revenues should be flat compared to the prior year and margins should be in the high 9% range.","IS&T. IS&T remains a good news story from a revenue perspective. Revenues were higher this quarter than in Q3 '12 as well as the prior quarter this year, in a very tough market.","Operating earnings and margins are up against Q3 '12 by $15 million and 30 basis points, respectively, and up $18 million and 60 basis points sequentially. This operating result was driven by improved performance at C4 Systems and AIS.","For the fourth quarter, IS&T should see a bit less revenue than we had in the third quarter with a modest decrease in operating margins. There's still work to be done here but we are seeing steady improvement from an operating perspective.","For the full year, IS&T revenues could be slightly lower than the prior year and margins should be in the high 7% range, consistent with prior guidance.","Let me turn to our EPS guidance for the remainder of 2013. Last quarter, we increased our guidance to $6.85 to $6.95 of earnings per diluted share. We are again increasing our guidance somewhat to $6.90 to $7, assuming that there is no residual impact from the shutdown.","We acknowledge that this quarter was better than anticipated and we are further along year-to-date than expected. However, I think our guidance, which is modestly increased, is not overly cautious and consistent with the current environment. In short, we had a great quarter and are hard at work trying to ensure that the full year will be beneficial for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. Erin?","Erin Linnihan","Now we will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Hugh Redd. Hugh?","L. Hugh Redd","Thank you, Erin. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'd like to cover the usual miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $22 million for the quarter versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2012. For 2013, we expect net interest expense of approximately $85 million.","At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects $129 million of net cash. And by that, I mean cash in excess of debt. This represents an improvement of $1 billion over the net debt position of a year ago.","The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the 9 months of 2013, consistent with that experienced in the same period of 2012. For 2013, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5%.","During the quarter, we contributed approximately $370 million to our pension plans. And through the end of the third quarter, we funded over $500 million to our plans with less than $100 million left to contribute in 2013.","Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for questions and answers.","Erin Linnihan","Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Glenn, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm out at NBAA. And I wanted to focus on Gulfstream this morning. The Aerospace book-to-bill I think...","Phebe N. Novakovic","By the way, you and everyone else, I think.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Possibly, it actually looks a little quieter this year, but I think some of that's the timing in the quarter. I wanted to ask you, though, about the order environment. And I think we've been hearing that, for your platforms, order demand is fairly even across the different areas, across the different markets, but at a lower level. And this is reflected, I think, in the 0.6 book-to-bill. And we really haven't seen a 1.0 book-to-bill for a while here. So I was going to ask you if you can talk about the different markets. And we sense that maybe large-cabin is softening a little bit on the order side, but at the same time, mid-cabin may be getting a little stronger. How would you comment on that?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Look, I'm pleased with our book-to-bill, and I think year-to-date, we have -- important to understand that we've got 10% more airplane orders in units than we did last year. But let me give you a little bit of background here. That said, we are a few orders shy of planes in the quarter as against our plan. And I think this is interesting. The quarter started out very strongly, but closed slower with getting to contract taking longer. And I think, certainly, the domestic order activity has been impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government shutdown and debt ceiling deliberations in Congress. But at the same time, we've seen a year-over-year growth in emerging markets and the rest of the world. So that's providing us some stability in our order book. And by the way, on the domestic side, we've got a very strong funnel. It's just taking, I think, longer to get to contract in the environment of a considerable amount of uncertainty. We've talked about in the previous quarters that when thinking about Gulfstream orders, we need to consider the mix, right? So again, this quarter, Gulfstream booked orders for each of our aircraft, and the 450 and 550 constituted about 70% of those orders. So I always look at the order in terms of mix because I think that, that tells a pretty good story. So all in all, we've seen a pretty consistent increase in our mid-cabin 280 and across our large-cabin, and I don't see anything that materially changes that in the horizon that we can see.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Phebe, just to close. On the 650, is it fair that because you're so sold out that the order environment is a little quieter there? And then the last part of the question is could you update us on the software development on that platform? It sounds like that is still progressing, but not quite where it needs to be.","Phebe N. Novakovic","650 continues to take orders. So I consider that quite positive. And the software development, I think largely what we've had is superb operating performance of that airplane, and it's meeting and exceeding the users' expectations. We've still got some back end in terms of cabin software issues, and that's as much as user interface training and we need to make some changes, and really modest and moderate, so nothing that has been -- things that are a little bit of annoyance, I think, but quite rightly so to our customers, but nothing material. We're not concerned about that. These are normal and, frankly, far less sort of squawks that we've had in any of our other airplanes. So I think, that said, that 650 is really a game changer.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to continue on Aero. When I think back a little ways, you all had commented that ultimately you could produce the G650, given the operation -- basically, a much better operational design for costs that would be even less than the 550. And what I'm interested in is when you look at how this is going in terms of cost performance and production, how do you see that trajectory today? In other words, are you on the path that you had hoped? Is it more challenging than you thought? Where does it stand?","Phebe N. Novakovic","All right. Let's talk about that in 2 parts. First, green, green manufacturing. We have, as you know, a purpose-built facility, along with the fact that we designed for producibility. So both of those have improved our learning curve as we have continued to move green aircraft through our facility and through the line. So we're not at our optimal, you wouldn't expect that. In fact, I don't know where optimal is and we won't know until we hit it. And our experience is that no matter where we are in the maturity of our platforms, we seem to get -- we do get better and better and better. So with respect to green, we are in line with and even a touch ahead of where we anticipated we might be. But I think we talked about early on this year that we had yet to -- we had a disconnect between green and completion. So we have largely taken care of what I termed a disequilibrium between the 2, but we haven't gotten to a steady running rate on green -- or on completions and margins on completions. So that's going to take some time and have -- provide some upside, but it's going to take some time for us to work through that. But all in all, we're very, very pleased with the manufacturing process on the 650.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And when you look at completions, what is making that so challenging? Is this more challenging than perhaps you've seen on earlier programs, say, the 550?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Absolutely not in this stage of the development, right now. Now going back 2 quarters, yes, it was far more challenging because we had built up this backlog of green in anticipation for the flight certification, and then we had an awful lot of fairly expensive rework. But we're past that, we're through that. And so our experience now is frankly there's -- it's the completion challenges aren't as great as they were in the early days of the 450s and 550s or the 5s and 4s. But nonetheless, we haven't hit full stride there and we probably have a little bit ways to go before that happens. That's just normal learning as we come down various learning curves.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Research (sic)[Shapiro Research].","George Shapiro","I just want to push a little bit on your Gulfstream margin. I mean, that would imply like the fourth quarter's got to be like about 16%, substantially below this quarter on similar revenues, which would tell me there's maybe $25 million of these added expenses that you were talking about. So could you just break out how much of that you think is R&D and some of the other issues you mentioned?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Look, I think some of that is going to be available in our Q to the extent you can parse it. I don't really want to give you the eaches but let me give you just some general magnitudes. We have pushed R&D to the right as a normal part of -- as we've gotten into our development program. That will hit us in the fourth quarter. At the same time, launch assistance is an important part of our overall product development. And the launch assistance comes in lumpiness. So it's a little less in this quarter. So that's a fairly significant part of what's driving the margins down. In addition, we've got some timing issues at Jet, really fourth quarter, first quarter '14 kinds of issues, that are also having some margin compression. So in general, we're looking for margins in the close to 16% -- 15.7% range in Aerospace for the fourth quarter, as I've kind of articulated. And we're going to have a few -- fewer large-cabin deliveries, which is often what happens in the fourth quarter as we move around airplane deliveries to suit the needs of our customers. So it is a combination. You can imagine with a big business like this with a lot of moving parts, it's a combination of those items that I've already articulated.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about cash flow. It looks like you contributed a little bit more to the pension plan than I think you had planned. But in the past, you talked about being able to get to 90% of net income in free cash and then use more than 100% of that towards buyback and dividend. That would imply an awfully steep fourth quarter. And is that still on track, and what's going to change between now and year end?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. So before I get into that, let me argue a little bit with the predicate. I don't recall ever saying that we would contribute more than 100%. That would require going into the balance sheet. And I actually was very careful not to say that. But I don't want to quarrel on that[ph] noise, but I do want to talk a little bit about -- and thanks for asking the question -- about cash and cash deployment in several respects. So first, I think you can see from our schedules in the press release that we have an increase in inventory and work-in-process. We are hard-working this because I don't like increases in working capital. And frankly, we're having trouble getting paid in a few instances. So we'll work through that, but it's affecting our free cash flow conversion. Second, we have higher pension contributions that we -- and we had planned those at about the $600 million level. Free cash -- we had expected free cash flow to be below 100% and anticipated around 90%. That was before the government shutdown and the latest crisis. And third, cash has been coming in late this year. I mean, we've been meeting our plan but it is coming in slightly [ph] later, usually the last day or 2 of the quarter and something we had anticipated -- or experienced in the first couple of quarters. But I think that this brings me to something that I'd like to share with you. I'd like to talk to you about the import of the brinksmanship on the debt ceiling and the shutdown, at least from my perspective. I think we should think about the shutdown in 2 phases for us. Phase 1 is DFAS and DCMA civilians were furloughed, execution on in-process invoice stopped. Phase 2, DoD calls DFAS and DCMA back to work, payment resumed. An extended phase 1 ultimately challenges liquidity. Simultaneously, this is no news to anybody, the government took the nation to the edge on the debt ceiling extension. And in my mind, we were forced to gaze into the abyss, where we saw the full faith and credit of our principal customer at risk. That was sobering and suggests that we need to be cautious with cash as we finish the year and move into next. And frankly, as I think about it, I think it is premature to assume that the conditions extend[ph] in October cannot repeat in January. It's entirely possible that we find ourselves an extended period of time trapped in Dante's first circle of hell. So I think all of that suggests that we need prudence and caution as we move into the rest of the year and the beginning of next year, until we can get a more stable plan from the government with respect to both the debt ceiling and funding for our principal customer.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But most of those...","Phebe N. Novakovic","That's kind of how I'm thinking about cash.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is that a timing issue, though, so that if something slips out of this year, it's just next year, because of the timing of that cycle? Or is there actually a change in the actual collection?","Phebe N. Novakovic","No. We're pretty much meeting our plan. But I'm mindful that we have seen some timing issues. They've all cleared, largely, within the quarter. But I think we're seeing slowdown in payments, certainly by our government customers and some of the customers for whom we are suppliers. So that just brings some caution. And there is nothing intrinsically, other than those things that I've mentioned, that will ultimately affect our cash generation capabilities. But it's largely a question of timing, not something that I'm alarmed at but something I'm watching very carefully.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Phebe, the Gulfstream margin was very significantly better, even though you have this adverse mix shift more towards the 650 and away from the 450 and 550. Can you give us a little bit more color on some of the issues you laid out? For example, was -- launch aid was high or how big about and how big for the year? Was there sequential improvement in the productivity and the profitability of the 650 as well as the 450, 550, x the supplier price hikes? Was there sequential improvement in Jet versus the second quarter?","Phebe N. Novakovic","All right. Let me give you a little bit of more detail here. We had higher performance across all of our lines, at all of our new plane production lines at Gulfstream, with the exception of the 450 and a little bit the 550 because of some of those supplier costs. But x that, clearly, productivity increases. Second, we had one of our best service quarters ever in revenue and margin. So it's a very -- at Gulfstream, very strong service and margin performance there. And I talked to you a little bit about Jet because that's a very -- that's a good news story compared to where we've been. Think about Jet in 3 respects. First -- in 3 lines of business. First is their FBO and service business. Those have continued, since we've owned them, to perform very well and exceeding our expectations. Second is their maintenance business. And if you recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we sold or closed a number of our facilities in Europe, maintenance facilities. So our revenue was lower on maintenance, as we anticipated, but margins are up. So I'm very pleased with that. And then the big muscle movement has been all along with Jet completions. And I've been reporting to you steady improvement on our operations at Jet. That team has done an excellent job turning around what was a very troubled program -- or a very troubled line of business. And we are at profitability. Our order book has increased, our funnel has increased. And I -- but I'm very cautious about sales in the completion side because they're big and they're lumpy. And we need to approach that, as we do, with a fair amount of realism about the art of the possible, good terms and conditions, fairness and ability to meet schedule for our customers. But Jet is a good news story and that team out there needs to be commended. So all of those things -- and Jet, by the way, has been profitable every quarter this year. All of those elements combine to drive up margins, a little bit above where I had anticipated. But don't get out ahead of me in the fourth quarter, because we do have higher R&D. And by the way, we did -- you asked a question about launch assistance in this quarter, in third quarter, not material. But in the fourth quarter, it's going to be less and that's just a question of timing, nothing specific. All right?","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So when you say launch assistance, is this a payment that you make or a payment that is made to you?","Phebe N. Novakovic","In the Aerospace business, suppliers tend to contribute to the development of new products or refresh. We certainly do when we're supplying to Aerospace prime and on the commercial Aerospace side, and our suppliers do as well. That's nothing new. That's something that we've seen for the last 10, 15 years since we've been in development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just over on the Combat business, sales have been obviously really kind of trailing off and were down 30%. There was a slight uptick in backlog, which was a very good sign. Just wondering if you could revisit your expectations on bookings, both domestic and international, what you're looking for there and the timing or the visibility or lack thereof. And even -- to the extent you're willing to do so, looking into next year or the next couple of years, where you think we're going to start to bottom out?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Okay. I appreciate this because I think this is an important question. As I go back and think about it, I explained to you all in January that we're going to work hard to make our order book, but I was uncomfortable giving you guys guidance around revenue, other than the most general, particularly in Combat. Because while we were going to work hard at revenue, we can't control it. And also, you may recall that the guidance I gave you was without regard to sequestration, let alone furloughs and the shutdown, all 3 of which has happened. So in a way, it's been, frankly -- it's no wonder that our revenue was lower. But I think this question deserves a little bit more clarity and detail, so let me give you that. Our sales are lower in Combat for 3 primary reasons, and I'll walk through each. First, most of the international orders we anticipated in the first quarter have not yet materialized and it's consistently slipped to the right. And clearly, without those, our sales estimates are going to be off. Second, we did not foresee the sharp decline in the military axle market as a result of the budget uncertainties in the Army and Marine Corps that have impacted both their force structure and equipment. And while MRAPs are remaining at some level within both of those services, they have been prioritized at a much lower priority as those services wrestle with the current environment. So we think that, as we can look forward, MRAP reset and modernization will occur in the future, but not at anywhere close to the level we anticipated. In my perfect world, in a sequestration-free environment, I suspect the outcome might have been otherwise, but that's not what we're facing. Finally and third, our U.S. Army customers' contracting activity is far slower than anything we had experienced to-date or anything we had anticipated. And I think that's because they're winding down 2 wars, rebalancing their budget, while unable to bring down personnel costs because of sequester rules. On top of which, they were whipsawed by the furloughs and shutdown. Their ability to contract has been pressured. So if you combine all of those, it's put a fair amount of compression on our sales estimates. That said, as you quite aptly point out, backlog for the quarter was up and our order activity was at about the 2012 running rate of about $1.4 billion and orders were twice the prior quarter. I don't want to get too far into the future because we are fairly early on in our planning horizon. But I will tell you that for the fourth quarter, we have included some of the large international orders, which should make up some of the difference reflected in this quarter's volume. But we are too late in the year to book enough sales to be in the range of our original plan. So sales for '13 are likely to be about 20% lower, at least under our current assumptions. I hope that helps give you a little bit of detail and color to parse through sort of what are the major muscle movements driving our sales impact.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That is helpful. If I may just follow up briefly. Do you expect bookings -- where do you expect bookings to come in, in Q4? And where do you expect to end the year in terms of Combat backlog, if you're willing to give that?","Phebe N. Novakovic","I'm not comfortable giving the backlog, but I -- we anticipate several of those international orders which have -- I think I've been pretty clear and it's been obvious, have slipped to the right quarter-by-quarter. But the circumstances that we had, the marketing circumstances and the environment that existed in the first quarter are still here, it's just a question of patience, which is something I'm not particularly good at, but I am nonetheless required to be patient here. But we continue to see several of those orders coming in, in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we go back to Gulfstream for a second? Phebe, I think you mentioned, in the quarter, you were maybe a couple light -- or a few light of your plan from an order perspective. And you also mentioned 70% of the orders, I think, in the quarter were 450, 550. The question really is can you give us some color on just the 450, 550 book-to-bill as you've seen it year-to-date? And would you actually have to see kind of better-than-planned closure of orders in the rest of the year to keep that production flat?","Phebe N. Novakovic","I really don't want to get into it, no surprise to you, but nice try asking, and to the book-to-bill by unit, because then I'll spend the rest of my time here in an exegesis on the various lines of airplanes we've got. But we've -- we have an order book and the funnel on the 450 and 550 have continued, and we see an uptick also in the 280. So everything that we see in our funnel and where we are in that funnel suggests that we just really need, on the domestic side, some stability coming from our government with respect to -- and the debt ceiling primarily, and the shutdown. But primarily, the debt ceiling, as we look at a lot of our domestic customers and they are a little wary. They're very interested. Interest is up across all of our lines, airplane lines, including the 450. And service revenue is up and continuing to look good, so far, into this quarter. So absent some exogenous force, like a real contraction in the U.S. economy, we're good to go on Aerospace.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One quick one, if I could squeeze it in. The employees that you're carrying, the 95,700 that you disclosed in the quarter, you're one of the few, if only, defense companies that actually has grown the employment, certainly in the last couple of years. Is that completely isolated to Gulfstream? And what does that picture look like just in the defense businesses?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, this is actually one of my favorite questions because it's something this management team and I look at frequently. If you parse this down, it's a tale of 2 cities. Gulfstream has increased its sales -- or its employees, as you would expect. Marine group somewhat, as we've begun to gear up, and particularly on our research and development side that are cost-plus engineers. IT has continued to increase, based on their order book and their sales, but it is -- so that's the tale of 1 city. And then everywhere else, in some instances, we're down 50% of our sales force. So this has been extremely painful across some of our businesses. They've done what they needed to do to respond to the environment. But I'm very mindful of the human impact of all of this and it's camouflaged by that gross number. But you can imagine that we work this very, very hard, as I see this as the level of our overall productivity. But there's a lot of specifics embedded there that tell 2 very different stories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to go back quickly to the Aerospace margin dynamics you outlined for Q4, and I wondered if you could help us think about what in that is temporary. You -- I think I heard you say that Q4 and into Q1, you expect the impact of the timing issue at Jet. But when you look beyond Q4 and into next year, is the R&D or launch assistance dynamic, does that play a material role in how we should think about the longer-term profitability? Or is there anything else that we should think isn't sort of temporary from what we're seeing in Q4? I guess the supplier renegotiation of 450, 550, anything like that.","Phebe N. Novakovic","It's temporary. Well, yes, so it's temporary on R&D and launch assistance, which tends to be kind of lumpy. And that, we will smooth as we plan for 2014. And I don't want to get too much into 2014. I suspect that the timing issues at -- on completions at Jet will resolve right away, quick. So that's nothing systemic. So when I think about the margin compression, absent what we talked about last quarter on higher supplier costs, there is nothing structural here going into '14. But as we go through our planning process, I'll have -- and on the fourth quarter call, I'll give you an awful lot more clarity about '14 and Gulfstream and margins and Aerospace in general. It's pretty typical of our planning process.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it really just comes down to the margin performance differential between the legacy large-cabins and the improvement you make on the 650 at this point once you look out there.","Phebe N. Novakovic","That's right, and that's going to be mix. And we'll get -- as we plan through next year and we'll take a look at what our really incremental learning is down each one of those lines, we'll begin to estimate, but that's not where we are yet. Going back to, there's nothing really structural here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, the other surprise was IS&T. And in some ways, Phebe, could you -- you talked a little bit about the environment, but the business seemed to outperform the environment. Could you provide a little more granularity and where some of your successes are and where some of your challenges are?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. So look, IS&T has done very, very well, and frankly, exceeded, I think, everybody's expectations, including mine. This team has worked hard. Without chasing revenues, they've held their own in a tough environment. That's across the board with AIS and GDIT on the revenue side. GDIT has performed very well on revenue and they're fighting their margins. As you know, that's a very tightly fought environment, but they're doing quite well. C4 has had an outstanding quarter with respect to margins. So let me give you a little bit of color on this. If you recall, as we entered the year, at the end of last year, we had 4 separate business units. We have now contracted to 3 in IS&T, because we, for reporting purposes, included GD U.K. within C4. And C4's margins have been very, very good, particularly in light of the drag out of GD U.K. And I think in the quarter, we have $11 million in charges out of GD U.K., and headwinds for and charges for the entire year-to-date at about $20 million, so very disappointing out of GD U.K., very disappointing. That said, we've got the A team in place there. Each one of those programs that we are participating in are strongly supported by our customer and by the team that we've got in place. So we're meeting the needs of our British customer, to which we're highly attuned and dedicated and have been for many, many years. This was just a prior management team that took its eye off the ball. And so we've got some cleanup. I spent a little time on that so you can understand the headwinds that, that entire group has faced in a difficult market on margins. So I'm very, very pleased with where they are. They've got a pretty good book-to-bill. We've had a steady order intake and we're really on the mend here. GDIT is quite a powerhouse, disciplined, mature management team, and I'm very confident where they are all headed. Does that help you?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, just as a follow-up, I mean, this business in some ways probably has the most sensitivity to some of the turmoil you described with your major customer. How is it you've been able to do a little bit better? I mean, other than discipline. I mean, is it -- I mean, the Army, clearly with Combat, with its radios and so on, on one hand, you have that market on the other. There's elements of a withdrawal that clearly should be hurting. So maybe a little more granularity.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Okay. Let me -- Yes, sure. Let me help you -- try to parse that a little bit for you. C4 is the business with the largest exposure to the Army, not exclusive but the largest. The IT business has some exposure but we have reorganized in all 3 of those business units -- by the way, don't think that I think reorganization is a panacea to performance, but it's a predicate to improved performance in a down environment. So in IT, we've consolidated a number of the businesses to take -- lines of business to take advantage of growth in some businesses en masse. So they are accommodating. They're somewhat small and offsetting their somewhat small exposure to the Army. AIS has almost no exposure, in fact, none to the Army. So that leaves C4. And I think in that context, let me give you a little bit of color on C4's -- and maybe this will help you, on C4's programs of record. We've got WIN-T and that network clearly remains a priority. If you think about the Army historically, they balanced out force structure with capability. And that network allows them to do more with less. So we're fortunate to be the incumbent on this program of record. And we've been adjusting our business to deliver the capabilities in whatever deployment schedule the Army is on. So we've had a number of LRIPs approved year-to-date and we're continuing to perform on that network. And again, we size our business to the demand of the Army. On the rifle -- or on the radios, I think it might help you to give a little bit of program color there. As you probably know, we're the incumbent for both HMS Manpack and the Rifleman radios, which take our network capabilities from the WIN-T backbone and down to the individual dismounted soldier. And we're currently delivering on both products in the thousands of units. So I think that, that's important in understanding what's driving the underlying demand at C4. That said, C4 is completely restructuring its business in order to meet the current environment and -- which will, I believe, going forward, give it significant opportunities to further right-size itself and adjust to the demands of its principal customer. And by the way, not exclusive customer as we get outside the United States. So I'm very pleased with the agility of that particular -- or all of our businesses, but that business to recognize the environment they are in and take appropriate actions. So I hope that helps you understand.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Phebe, I just wanted to ask about the portfolio and whether you feel like this is the right portfolio or there's still some portfolio shaping to do either through divestitures or acquisitions. Just kind of update us on your view of the portfolio at this point.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, let me talk about acquisitions. I think I've been pretty clear in the year that we are and will be focused on operations. I haven't had any acquisitions on my horizon. I don't now and I'm not looking. So let's take that off the table. But with respect to the portfolio, my vision hasn't changed. And I've talked to you all about that balance in our portfolio. With respect to positioning, let's talk about that in a little bit more detail. In the platform businesses, it's pretty easy to see that we're the clear market leader with critical mass, right? But in the IS&T portfolio, it's a bit harder to discern who does what to whom when, simply because our businesses are each comprised of thousands of programs. So positioning in IS&T tends to be by line of business rather than by major programs. So what the IS&T management team and I look at to balance our portfolio, pretty much continually, is that line of business positioning. And no real shaping is required now, not of any material issue. I mean, we may take some paring here and there as we walk through and see what's core and what's not. But so far, steady as she goes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Phebe, just a quick question for you. In the past, you've given us some idea of what the lead time is on your Aerospace models, in terms of when the next slot becomes available. I was wondering if you could give us an update maybe on the 650, the G450, 550 and the G280 on that basis?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, those -- each one of those -- well, 2 of those aircraft are legacy mature programs, right? And you would expect us to have some significant changes to -- in that environment as we go forward. 650 and 280 are brand-spanking new. So we would think about, in the normal course of business, refreshes, but I'm -- in a several-year time horizon. But I'm not going to get any more specific about that, since it seems to be high sport to what we're going to do and when we're going to do it. But I can tell you that our planning is very deliberative, it's not reactive. And when we announce an airplane, it's a real airplane and not a PowerPoint. So we're on track to do what we've always anticipated we would do, and we'll announce when we're ready.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The 450, 550 lead time has come down from 18 months, which it used to be. We shouldn't be too concerned about that then?","Phebe N. Novakovic","No. We've got, I think, some availabilities about a year out and we'll continue to work that. Those are very efficient, highly scalable lines. So we've got enough in our backlog that we're comfortable. So I'm not particularly concerned about that. If that changes, we'll let you know. But we're looking at the late, late end of '14, early '15. So I'm still comfortable that, that's a pretty good margin. And then, as I said, particularly about our hedge, as I said particularly in this quarter, where we saw a little bit of softening in the domestic environment. And I think that's wholly attributable to the machinations in our government.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A question, I guess, back on IS&T. I just wanted to dig in a little further. You're consolidating the GD U.K. and I appreciate the color there. When you think about the kind of the business lines, still 50% of the portfolio is on kind of the IT services side. Are there opportunities to kind of restructure or scale that if needed? I know you kind of look at it by lines of business, but maybe just some additional color there.","Phebe N. Novakovic","That management team has, in fact, reorganized to meet the current demand. So we've taken our units down from -- or the lines of reporting at the macro level from -- within IT, from 4 to 3, better streamline, reduce costs. And there, it's a daily fight across thousands of programs in multiple portfolios, from intel to each one of the services and beyond DoD into non-DoD agencies. So they are doing very well, I think because of their reputation and their cost structure, in winning more than their fair share of new contract awards. So I'm very proud of that management team. They're tough, they're mature, they're great businessmen.","Erin Linnihan","Glenn, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So maybe more of a fuzzy question. We walked through a lot of details on a lot of the business units, so thank you for all the detail on that. Now that you've been sitting in the role that you have been for a while, what really has been, from your perspective, maybe some of the biggest challenges that you've had to deal with in the role of CEO over the last couple of quarters? I mean, when you were kind of preparing for the role and now that you have it, I mean, what has been the biggest challenges?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, I think -- it's interesting, I don't face these challenges alone, I face them with a management team. We spend an awful lot of time communicating among each other, as you would expect. And we have complete goal congruence. We are challenged in some of our markets by an environment, but I see that as an opportunity, frankly. In tough times, that's where you see human beings' character and their mettle and the strength of an organization. And GD is doing quite well, in my mind, managing what we can control. We're not going to lose a lot of sleep over those things that we can't control. But to the extent that we can control our operations, we're getting at it and getting at it hard. So I don't know that there have been any unique challenges. I think we've had a few curve balls as a country, frankly. I think we got a little bit further down the shutdown and brinksmanship paths than I think any of us, as Americans, would be comfortable for. But that wasn't idiosyncratic to General Dynamics, that's just, I think, at large. So I think that the challenges have been those that I expected, that we were going to see a little tougher environment. And that's the time when you differentiate yourself. So I've been very pleased with the management team. And it's about hanging tough and good leadership across the board. By that, I mean all of us, not just me.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. And then if I may, just one follow-on, just one quick detail, I don't think you discussed too much about it. In the quarter, the margins in Land Systems were outstanding, right? I mean, they were just about, what, 100 basis points behind...","Phebe N. Novakovic","Combat.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, Combat, excuse me, yes, behind Gulfstream. Was there...","Phebe N. Novakovic","By the way, they're well aware of that.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm certain they are. Was that team catch-ups? Or I mean, how should we think about it? And I was really like...","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, recall that we are not on team catch-up, okay? So look, this was the result of superb operating performance in that group. And as they continue to perform on each one of their programs, they've retired risks. And so this was really a really strong line-by-line focus on cost reduction. And I think that you've seen we anticipated this down cycle. I mean, we are in a cyclical business and we anticipated this down cycle and got out ahead of it with a fair amount of restructuring. So that's coming to fruition. The fourth quarter will see a little bit of margin compression. You haven't asked us, but I'll just give you a little bit of color. We've got the remainder of the ATP-OTS consolidation costs, which we will cover. It's the right thing to do and will put us in good position going forward. It's been clear, I think, from some of the press announcements, we've got a bit of mix shift at Land Systems as we move from mature programs into the double-V hull. And now, we're going to pick up some headwinds on that axle market. But in general, this is solid performance of a very good management team. And by the way, a lot of these guys lived through the last downturn, post the end of the Cold War. They know what to do. And that culture has, at both Air[ph] and Electric Boat[ph] , has permeated all of GD. Enough of my proselytizing, but that's what happened.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, all, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3583.

Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Alison Harbrecht, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2017 conference call.","Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter, with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.02 per share better than consensus.","With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated somewhat more revenue, but lower margins and a somewhat higher tax rate. Operating earnings were about as forecast by the sell side. All in all, pretty close.","Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue of $7.68 billion was $99 million or 1.3% lower. However, net earnings of $749 million were up $35 million or 4.9%, on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins and 160 basis point lower effective tax rate. This led to EPS that was 6.5% better than the year ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was up $234 million or 3.1% and operating earnings were up $21 million or 2%, on a 10 basis point lower operating margin, still very respectable 13.8%.","Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Revenue was down $134 million, less than 1% against the first half of 2016. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $140 million or 7.2% on lower cost. Operating margins were 100 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $144 million or 10.5%. EPS was $0.55 better.","In short, we had a very good first half, somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations, and well ahead of last year. This leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance in a minute.","But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance.","First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $2.08 billion was $206 million lower than the year ago quarter. However, operating earnings of $425 million or $1 million more, on 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $4 million and operating earnings were down $18 million, on a 90 basis point reduction in margin, but remaining in excess of 20%.","For the first half, revenue at $4.15 billion is up $87 million against last year. Importantly, operating earnings at $868 million are up $112 million or 14.8%, on a 230 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $868 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, Aerospace is well positioned to achieve its earning goals for the year.","By the way, recall we previously told you that the new revenue recognition rule which helped us in the first two quarters of the year would have a negative impact in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So expect lower operating margins in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. You'll see this reflected in our guidance.","Let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market, insofar as it impacts Gulfstream. First, in the quarter, the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.9 to 1, which is very good. The mix is particularly advantageous, with over 80% of the orders for large-cabin aircraft. The G500 and G600 continued to build backlog in advance of their entry into service, sufficient to ensure the success of these programs, interestingly, the G550 built backlog as well in the quarter.","While we read the reports of weak demand and reduced deliveries across the industry, our experience is reasonable and steady demand for our products. We will deliver as many airplanes this year as we did last on an entry-into-service basis.","Commentators frequently speak of weakness in the large-cabin market. Let me say that it is misleading to speak of a highly differentiated marketplace as if it were one market. Parts of the market are very active, particularly those market segments where there is new product. There are also market segments that are slow, largely because of the absence of product introduction. So we believe that the market is not only differentiated by segment, but also by the innovative offerings within this segment. We believe this is why demand for our products remain fairly consistent.","We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early contract activity and contract discussion. The interest in the G650 and G650ER as well as the G550 remains quite good and supportive of next year's operating plan. In short, we expect a good third quarter and a second half from an orders perspective.","Now, let me say a few words about our progress towards certification of the G500 and G600. The G500 and G600 flying continues to go well. The aircraft are performing reliably and on schedule. The G500 testing includes four test aircraft and one production aircraft with a full interior. The four test aircraft have entered the Type Inspection Authorization or TIA flying phase. This phase is for actual certification credit. FAA pilots have joined Gulfstream flight crews on these TIA tests. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to ensure optimal safety and efficient use of resources.","We expect to complete certification flying in Q4 2017. Additionally, we continue to work closely with our suppliers to complete all component level testing this year. Once we have completed certification, the interior test aircraft, P1, will enter service as our G500 demonstrator. It is important to note, however, that the G500 will not have any impact to revenue and earnings this year. That is the result of the new revenue recognition rule. The G600 now has four test aircraft flying and the interior is being installed in the first production aircraft. We remain on schedule to certify in 2018.","Let's now turn to the defense side of the house. First, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.41 billion was $117 million more than the second quarter last year, up 9%. Similarly, operating earnings were $225 million, up $20 million, almost 10% better than second quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $127 million or almost 10%, and operating earnings were up $20 million, again, almost 10% better.","For the first half, revenue was up $159 million or 6.3% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were up $38 million, 9.7% on a 50 basis point margin expansion. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well across our platforms, ordnance and ammunition portfolios. We continue to move nicely from engineering to production on our two large international orders. We also continue to win programs particularly out of our European Land Systems business. We are obviously trending in the right direction at Combat Systems.","With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.08 billion was $101 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $6 million against the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $145 million and operating earnings were up $17 million on the higher revenue and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.01 billion was down $87 million or 2.1% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were also lower by $17 million on a 30 basis points contraction in margin.","Work on our submarine programs, that is production on Blocks 3 and 4 for the Virginia-class and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine replacement, continue to perform nicely. With respect to our Bath shipyard, the challenges on the DDG 1000 and 51 restart ships are largely behind us, and our auxiliary ship and commercial businesses continued smoothly. In addition, we have seen an uptick in demand for repair across our repair yards, primarily in San Diego and Washington State. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. Our operating margin should continue to improve over time.","Turning to IS&T, the group continues to perform well on the bottom line, despite some revenue headwind. Revenue of $2.1 billion was down $111 million against the year ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings of $240 million were up against the year ago quarter by $6 million. There was an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive.","Sequentially, revenue was lower by $42 million or 2%, but operating earnings were up $4 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin. This quarter's 11.4% operating margin is exceptional in my view.","The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $293 million or 6.4%, but operating earnings were up $5 million on an 80 basis point improvement in margins. So once again, very strong operating leverage. For both our IT services and tactical communication and Intel business, our cost performance and market positioning have driven very nice win rates. Not surprisingly, our IS&T backlog grew $175 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of greater than 1 to 1 once again. In short, we believe the segment results leave us positioned to do well in the second half.","Before I move on, let me give you a sense of the defense environment, at least from my perspective. There is clear intent in the administration and in parts of the Congress for increased defense spending. We believe this intent will manifest in some level of increased defense spending in the procurement and R&D accounts.","The question is how much and when? Relevant considerations include: the dispatch with which Congress approves a higher defense budget and how soon the administration can propose and the Congress can approve the department's senior leadership appointment. Without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts and get authorized and appropriated funds obligated to contracts. At this juncture, both are proceeding more slowly than we thought would happen. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the direction of defense spending.","So turning to guidance, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS outlook.","For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016; operating earnings of approximately $1.6 billion, with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. We now expect to be approximately $8.1 billion of revenue, with margins of 19.5% to 19.6%. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This will result in no change to the operating earnings forecast, still a very strong industry-leading performance.","For Combat, our previous guidance was to expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% over 2016, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.9 billion, just slightly above the 7% growth over last year, and operating earnings of $925 million to $930 million. So pretty close to the original guidance, with a slight upward bias.","For the Marine group, we've previously guided to revenue of $7.9 billion, margins at around 8.6% and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. We now expect revenue to be up another $160 million to $165 million, with margins consistent with the previous forecast, resulting in a modest improvement in operating earnings.","For IS&T, we guided to revenue up modestly over 2016, operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast is essentially flat and that operating earnings will be somewhat better at about 11.2% to 11.4%.","So all of this rolls up into revenue for General Dynamics of about $31 billion and operating margins of 13.3% to 13.5% \u2013 13.4% to 13.5%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, operating earnings at the higher end of the forecasted range, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70 to $9.75.","To help you further, our EPS guidance was $9.50 to $9.55. The $0.20 difference is $0.05 from operations, $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower tax rate and about $0.09 to $0.10 from share purchases. The EPS progression for the remainder of the year is down slightly in Q3 versus Q2, with Q4 looking similar to this quarter.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $23 million in the second quarter of 2016. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $49 million versus $45 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $105 million.","Our effective tax rate was 27.4% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date. As Phebe mentioned, we're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of 27.5%. That reflects a greater benefit associated with employee stock option exercises than originally anticipated.","On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares, bringing us to 4.6 million shares in the first half of the year for $900 million. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid, through the first six months of 2017, we've spent $1.4 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than 1.5 times our $857 million of free cash flow for the first half.","This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $2.1 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approximate 100% of net earnings and, in turn, deploying 100% of that free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends.","Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Amy, can you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. The first question comes from Ronald Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, Phebe and Jason.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Ron.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just a big picture question for you, Phebe, in terms of the Land Systems business. We've seen a lot more press lately on the Russian T-14 Armata tank. When you look at the Land Systems business and you kind of look into the tea leaves, is there an opportunity there for you guys in terms of some sort of equipment response from the U.S. in terms of either yet another upgrade to the Abrams or something new, if you can add any color there.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes. So the U.S. Army is anticipating upgrading the Abrams to the next version, in part to meet the changing and evolving threat, frankly, worldwide. So we have factored a lot of that into our thinking. And if you think about it, we went from one tank production a month for several years, just keeping that plant on my support and we're now looking at nice, nice improvement and throughput for that plant. So we see demand increasing for the Abrams in various configurations, both domestically and outside the U.S. as well. So the Abrams is, I think, positioned quite well to do \u2013 to continue to grow.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Samuel Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, IS&T has been running down for the first half of the year, if I just look last year, it's little bit of a tough comparison, you're still expecting to get to flat. I mean, how do you get there? What do you need to win or what's happening with IS&T in terms of being able to get to growth in the second half of the year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So let's talk about that in two respects. First, both of these businesses are shorter-cycle businesses and they're more affected by an extended CR. Recall, we had a seven-month extended CR, which had a impact on our products business and the execution of obligated funds, execution of appropriated funds in terms of obligation. So that's pretty much a question of timing as the military services gear back up on their execution.","The second side is on our services business. We had very slow execution on programs in several civilian agencies, primarily driven by uncertainty and, in some cases, reduction in funding levels. I suspect some of that we'll obtain through the course of the year until the administration sorts out some of the funding for some of the civilian agencies. But that said, we believe that our products business is poised for growth for the remainder of the year. Recall, we have a very nice backlog in this business, so it's simply a question of timing, when our customers execute programs.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Strauss at UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason, Alison.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Wanted to ask on cash flow. I think, Jason, you comment that you're still targeting 100% free cash flow conversion for the year, through the first half a little weaker than I expected. Can you just talk about what's going on there? The billed and unbilled receivables, and does that stabilize through the rest of the year or partially reverse, and what exactly is driving that? Thanks.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. I guess at a macro level, what we've seen through the first half of the year is really on par with what we planned for the year, so nothing out of the ordinary. We expected a bit of a ramp to the second half. So as I mentioned, still targeting at or around 100% conversion.","The build-up in working capital, you mentioned was actually anticipated in connection with the Land Systems' international programs. Really what we're seeing there is as we're moving from what we experienced in the past couple of years with large advance payments and then the burn down of those advance payments, which we've talked about ad nauseam at this point.","As we move into production, you're seeing a more typical build-up of the unbilled receivables prior to delivery. And as we then move into a ramp up of deliveries, we'll begin to liquidate that unbilled receivables and we expect to see that to start to turn in the second half, and hence, a bit more of the ramp in the cash flow in the second half. So all part and parcel of moving from the development phase of that contract into production and a subsequent ramp in deliveries. So we'll see that unwind beginning in the second half.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Harned at Bernstein.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On Gulfstream, Phebe, you've talked in the past about your pipeline being very strong, and I think you're reiterating that today. But one of the things that you've raised is the fact that it's been a little slower converting interest into firm orders. Could you give us a sense from the discussions you're having, and I would say both in the U.S. and abroad, with customers, are there things that are slowing them down, in other words, are they looking for signals, economic signals, you had mentioned Brexit a while back when that happened, what are you seeing holding people back?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Nothing. Actually, no substantive issue in particular, simply more rigor as they move into the contracting process. So I don't see any macro reasons. We have identified none that we've got potential customers who are waiting on the sidelines, it's simply just taking longer for a whole series of reasons. Everything from the introduction of brokers to additional board approvals, so for fleet aircraft purchases. Those are constant, but there's nothing in particular that's driving this other than I think this is just a new regular order. It's going to just take longer from the time you enter the pipeline to the time you sign the contract.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And presumably, your transition to the new models, I would think would be a part of this too?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes. I don't think that there's anything particular about those new models that would change the length of time that we're experiencing. I think that's a structural change. It's simply around timing. It's taking a bit longer, and we've learned to adjust to it.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Myles Walton at Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was hoping to follow-up on Gulfstream. I think, Phebe, you mentioned that there'd be no G500 deliveries in 2017. I thought there was going to be one. And then also the sales guidance ticking down, is that the slippage of a few deliveries, or is that just the G500 and maybe used aircraft in isolation?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, there are a couple of things that are affecting the revenue. We anticipate lower \u2013 now, we anticipate lower pre-owned, that carries with it, with a lower pre-owned sales that reduces revenue, but increases margin. We have a few \u2013 fewer G450 deliveries and then just lots of other puts and takes.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Nothing on the certification, EIS (27:01)?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","No, no, we're good with that. We're on track. The certification and flight test program is proceeding very, very well. And Jason can give you just a little bit more color on the \u2013 this really is the essence of the change of the impact of revenue recognition.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. I mean, we had talked about for a while dating back entry into service this year, and that's still, as Phebe pointed out in her remarks, the demonstrator aircraft will enter service this year. So we'll complete certification, get type certification, enter that aircraft into service, but that, of course, won't have a revenue implication, that's what she was referring to in her remarks. But nothing otherwise off-schedule or off-plan from what we had anticipated this year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Spingarn at Credit Suisse.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just sticking with Aerospace and Gulfstream, you still \u2013 despite the sequential downtick, the margins are still excellent, and I would think that mix is trending away from some of the more mature programs, and so how \u2013 Phebe, where would you say the G650 margins are today relative to G450, G550 at peak maturity? How much more runway do you have there to offset the mix of the new aircraft as they come in? And then will there be any margin support at some point from reduced R&D or you're going to keep that level?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So the G650 margins have exceeded the G450 and G550 at their peak. And you ask a question that I ask Gulfstream frequently, how much better can we do? And we will do better, the quantum of which we'll have to see. But we've come down our learning curve. That purpose-built facility has turned out to be an operating mix-up (29:10) for us.","It's been really nice fit for our guys to be able to get sequential airplane-over-airplane improvement. So I suspect we have more to go. You're never done in the continuous improvement. The R&D, you can anticipate our R&D spending to be about the same level. We have a very robust R&D pipeline, product pipeline, so obviously, that is that (29:38).","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Cai von Rumohr at Cowen.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much, Phebe. So GD always has kind of prided itself on focus on return of capital. With stock prices moving up and your own moving up, reducing the leverage of stock repurchase, at what point does it make sense to shift the focus from repurchase to M&A?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, when attractive, accretive and strategically important target cross our path. So that heretofore has yet to happen. But nonetheless, we don't really comment on this as you well know, but we're certainly not \u2013 we're certainly predisposed to be interested should our criteria be met.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gursky at Citi.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, I was wondering if we could spend a few minutes back on Marine and have you talk a little bit about your view of the world on undersea unmanned, kind of what that market looks like and what do you think GD's strategy might be and maybe what some of the challenges are in that market? And then maybe just to add on some comments here at the end about the demand out at NASSCO with Jones Act and the LNG products that you can produce out there, kind of what the pipeline looks like for those ships? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure, sure. So as you well know, we are fully embedded in the undersea warfare element of the Navy's shipbuilding budget. We are \u2013 we've been very encouraged to see the Navy's interest in additional SSN Virginia-class. I think they increased recently their shipbuilding plan by 18 SSNs, that's about a 38% increase from 48 to 66, consist of Virginia-class. So that would be very, very encouraging, if that comes to pass. We will see.","We're positioning ourselves, as you all know, for the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. The design is going extremely well, and we're on track to begin the build process exactly when we thought we would. So we see the undersea deterrent and the undersea war-fighting capability of the U.S. Navy as a key national security imperative as clearly evidenced by the Navy's interest in increasing subs.","With respect to NASSCO, interesting to speculate for a moment, NASSCO has continued to perform very, very well. We have the potential for an additional ESB, I think that would be ESB 6. That's a program formerly known as MLP. And we'll see if that comes to pass. We also have \u2013 the Navy's given us long-lead funding for the second oiler, and there's an opportunity to accelerate that program to two ships a year, should the Navy so choose. But frankly, all of this takes money, so we're going to have to see how the budget process shakes out and what programs receive what funding and when.","Operator","The next question comes from Howard Rubel at Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","Hi, thank you very much.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Howard.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","So you've got a whole host of opportunities in front of you, Phebe, and two sort of stand out. One is there's a lot of FMS deals that have been announced, but not yet contracted, and then the G550 platform clearly has a number of military applications that range from domestic to international. Could you put a fence around it or bracket some of this and help us a little bit with timing?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So on the FMS, for those programs that flow through FMS, we expect Kuwaiti tanks and tanks for the Kingdom in the fourth quarter. The tanks for the Kingdom have already received Congressional approval. Primarily, we see the FMS used for tanks, less so on the wheeled vehicle side. We also see FMS for our munitions and armaments business, and that has been proceeding quite nicely, not in the big ticket items that the tanks represent, but nonetheless nice steady volume.","With respect to the G550, the G550 is, as I'm sure you know, in service in a number of non-U.S. Air Forces in the ISR mission. And by the way, when we talk about special mission, we mean the ISR mission and we mean Medevac primarily. So \u2013 but on the ISR front, the G550 has been in service in some cases for many years in a couple of countries and performed extremely well.","To the extent that there are opportunities for the G550 in the U.S. Air Force market, the Air Force will tell you \u2013 tell us if they want our airplane. They don't, they don't. We're \u2013 Air Force programs, we're not that intimate with the Air Force, so I tend to defer any questions on the big Air Force programs to the prime. But with respect to the G550, I think it stands on its own merit.","I think there are also some opportunities moving away from the ISR front if you look at the U.S. Air Force and some potential opportunities to refresh some of the executive transport airplanes. But that is a longer-term potential program. I would note that a number of the airplanes are getting a little old in the Air Force executive transportation fleet. So that's again their call and we'll be prepared to respond to whatever their requirements are of us.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Phebe, I wondered if you could talk to us about the review of WIN-T that General Milley is undertaking and the decision by Senate authorizers to reduce funding and kind of how you see the future of the program from here?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. The Army, as it's been widely reported, reviewing its networking and communication strategy, including, but not limited to, WIN-T. And as you can well imagine, we're working very closely with our customers to respond to any changing requirements. And those will play out over time to the extent that there are any. We don't see any significant risk, by the way, in this year to our WIN-T estimate. To give you just a little bit more color, we have a long-standing, 20-year, networking expertise in land forces \u2013 tactical land forces network, and we think that positions us very well to work with our Army customer now and in the future.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Arment at Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning, Phebe, Jason.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Phebe, on Aerospace in particular, I guess, it's been a while since we've talked about Jet Aviation. Maybe you could just give us an update on how that business is doing and is it growing, and what are the prospects you're seeing out there for that?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes. So Jet Aviation is doing quite well. Their services businesses are up, again, primarily driven by increased flying hours. And their completion revenue and earnings are down a bit due in part to reduced inductions from Bombardier and St. Louis, but we're doing very well in Basel on our completions programs as we transition from engineering to production on several airplanes. So Jet Aviation, both on its services side and its completions side, continues to perform very nicely.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Phebe, in your commentary, you mentioned that the margin in IS&T was exceptional in the quarter. Does this imply that you don't expect this level of return to be sustained over the medium to long term?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","No, I think I meant exceptional in the sense that it was noteworthy, not that it was rare. As I think we're guiding you to margins in the 11.3% to 11.4% range. I anticipate that we will have no trouble in meeting that spot on. I don't expect any upside beyond that. But these businesses have performed very, very well. Our attention to cost, schedule and performance has really driven the bottom line in both those services business and the products business and communications networking and Intel.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thank you. Can you hear me?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, thanks. Phebe, a little more on G650, can you comment on how you're thinking about rate there in the next year given the comment on strong demand and how the sales effort for the ER conversions are progressing? And then maybe to that a little more, can you talk about the margin profile on the ER variant, is that really a whole lot different than the non-ER model? Thank you so much.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, I'll take the questions in inverse order. I'm not going to parse the differences in margins between the G650 and the G650ER. But as we've been talking about for some time, G650 production is going to come down somewhat in each of the next three years. We increased the production to help us in this transition period as we move from the G450 to the G500 in particular. And so our expectation, the balancing that we've been doing this year and into next is that as the G650 revenue begins to decline, the G500 and G600 will offset that decline. I might note that the interest in the G650 and G650ER continue to be quite robust. In this quarter, we had the highest number of orders that we've had in the last six quarters for the G650 and G650ER. So that airplane continues to generate an awful lot of interest in the marketplace.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","So there's no thoughts in maybe pushing out the rate cut?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Pushing up the rate?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","No, pushing out the rate cut, putting it off?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","No. I think that as we look at where the G500 is in terms of orders and our production schedule on the G500, we're comfortable that we can offset the somewhat reduced G650 sales. But I think that's just prudent business.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Skibitski at Drexel Hamilton.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Good morning, guys. Hey, Phebe, I was wondering if you can go further on your thoughts on the fiscal 2018 defense budget just in terms of the markups and the signals you're getting out of Congress, it still seems a bit muddled over there, especially on the Senate side. And I'm wondering if you see a good path to getting \u2013 to eventually getting a budget that's above the President's request or it's just too fuzzy right now?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, if you go back a number of years, I think we used to have insights into the defense budget process, both within any given administration and on Capitol Hill that weren't necessarily widely shared or available. But given the ubiquitous amount of information that flows today, I think you all know as much as I do in terms of specificity. But the President's budget exceeded \u2013 the budget request exceeded the budget caps by $54 billion; OCO, the Overseas Contingency fund has often acted as a relief valve for the caps.","So perhaps, Congress will consider doing something like that in addition to being able to can never (43:56) adjust those caps. Both the Senate and House Authorization Bills are significantly in excess of the President's budget. And the House Defense Appropriations Committee is about $135 billion, I think, over the President's request.","So look, what does all that mean? Right now, it's a giant fur ball and we're going to have to work through the process and see what comes out the other side. As I noted, I believe that there is real interest and desire in additional defense spending which will manifest itself in some more additional funding and budget for defense. It's just a question of how much and what accounts and when. So we still have ways to work through this process.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thank you very much.","Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.","Amy, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","The final question is from George Shapiro at Shapiro Research.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Hi, Phebe. Typical question for you. If you look at the Gulfstream margin in Q3 and assume it's like it was maybe this quarter, it implies the fourth quarter has got to really drop to 16% or so to get to your guidance. And if you're not going to deliver a G500 in the fourth quarter, so what happens in Q4 to get that big contraction in the margin?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","I'll let Jason attack that one.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","George, I mean, obviously, we can try to reconcile the math, I don't think ours is worked out exactly as yours is suggesting. That's probably not totally unusual. But I think the two bigger issues are a little bit of a downtick in the number of deliveries in the fourth quarter. We've talked about that as it relates to outfitted deliveries under the new standard versus our old revenue recognition model. So that is baked into plan. And then it's somewhat bit of a mix there. So more significantly the volume of deliveries, there's a little bit of mix issue affecting the margin. But I don't think it's down quite as dramatically as you're suggesting. It is definitely off as implied in Phebe's guidance.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","But let me follow-up, Jason, I mean, you said deliveries for this year would be about equal to last year and the first half is pretty close to the first half of last year. So the Q3 delivery is then going to be a lot bigger and the Q4 one is down, or how does deliveries going to spread out over Q3 and Q4?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. I don't have the Q3 in front of me, directly, I do know that Q4 is off a little bit. I also know that last year was particularly lumpy. The second quarter was a bit of a spike. So we can parse through the quarterly deliveries, but 4Q is definitely off slightly and that's what's the largest impact driving the margin difference.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","You're welcome.","Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you for joining our call today.

My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. And you have the floor, ma'am.","Amy  Gilliland","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.","Jay L. Johnson","Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by noting that today mark the 60th anniversary of General Dynamics' listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Generations of employees have helped to make this great corporation successful over the past 6 decades. Our exceptional people continues to drive GD through their innovation, operational excellence and commitment to continuous improvement. I am proud to be their CEO.","Before speaking to the quarter, I want to address the current defense budget environment. On the fourth quarter call in January, I mentioned the potential for complications to 2012 budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, the likelihood of another continuing resolution and the threat of sequestration.  These potential complications have indeed revealed themselves to us in the first quarter, particularly in our shorter cycle IS&T business, as looming budget cuts negatively influenced Department of Defense and federal government acquisition execution. While it's still early in the year, we're in no position to know the full effect of these complications on the year. The anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate, as we move into the summer months and the election campaigns roll into high gear.","Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although no one can explain how avoiding the severe cut will be achieved. In recent weeks, Pentagon leadership has reiterated that no plans are in place to deal with sequestration, while stating that they expect further guidance from the Office of Management and Budget this summer on how to begin planning. This will certainly spawn increased rhetoric and speculation, as details emerge on how cuts will be administered, making it even more difficult to overcome our customers' reticence to commit resource.  ","In the midst of this uncertainty or the \"fog bank,\" as I often refer to it, the FY '13 budget has begun the Congressional approval process. While there are some puts and takes across our portfolio, as you would expect, there were no real surprises for General Dynamics in this budget request, and we were generally pleased with the support for our shipbuilding and technical communications program. As expected, the future disposition of Stryker and Abrams programs will be the subject of ongoing discussions with all stakeholders.","As we look to the rest of the year and much of our portfolio, contracts are in hand, and we're on our way to achieving our expectations. In other parts of our portfolio, particularly our short cycle IS&T products and services, risks remain. We are doing everything we can to jumpstart the expenditure of previously appropriated funds.","And with this as prologue, let's talk about the quarter. Revenues in the first quarter were $7.6 billion, down from the first quarter of last year due to lower defense revenues, particularly in IS&T. Operating earnings were $860 million, leading to company-wide operating margins of 11.3%. Net earnings were $564 million, which resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 on a fully diluted basis.  ","Revenues, earnings and operating margins were negatively impacted by $67 million of non-cash, other period adjustments recorded at Combat Systems' European subsidiary European Land Systems, ELS. In total, the corrections at ELS reduce the company's fully diluted earnings per share by $0.13 in the quarter. These adjustments were not a function of program performance, but rather were related to shortcomings in our accounting department at ELS.  ","Following a thorough analysis, we determined that certain transactions were not properly reflected in prior periods. The corrections have been made and the underlying causes remedied.  Free cash flow after capital expenditures, totaled $324 million or 57% of earnings from continuous -- continuing operations, better than last year's first quarter.","In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 1.4 million of our shares in the first quarter and acquired an FBO at Houston Hobby Airport, the fifth most active U.S. business aviation airport to further expand Aerospace's service network.  We also invested $90 million into our businesses to include the continuation of a $500 million, 7-year program to ensure Gulfstream's Savannah campus is sized to accommodate an expanding global customer base. And in March, our board increased the dividend to 8.5%, the 15th increase in as many years.","First quarter orders were stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to healthy activity in our Marine Systems group. At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $55.2 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract totaled $82.2 billion. ","Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business groups, starting with the defense businesses. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues were $1.9 billion, down modestly from last year's first quarter and in line with our plan for the year. Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on 2 significant LAV and tank-export programs, improved axle sales and the addition of Force Protection. This upside helped mitigate lower U.S. and European vehicle and ammunition volume, as well as the sale of the detection systems business, which was completed in the second quarter of last year.","Combat Systems delivered $203 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. The group's operating margins were 10.6%. Without the previously discussed accounting adjustment at ELS, the group's margins would've been approximately 350 basis points higher, reflecting good execution across our 3 U.S. Combat businesses.  ","And we continue to work on improving ELS' profitability by divesting non-core assets, reducing the number of operating location, moving its headquarters and better integrating the 4 entities that comprise the business.  These actions position ELS to compete more effectively in the broader global market, particularly, given the present challenges in their more difficult European home market.","Combat Systems' backlog declined from year end to $10.7 billion. Despite this decline, there were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce Stryker mine rollers and Foxhound vehicles, and to continue to demilitarized a variety of munitions. We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses, including over $1.5 billion in Stryker and Abrams awards and several production awards for an FMS tank upgrade program. Last week, in fact, we received an award for the 46 Abrams step upgrades funded in the FY '12 budget.","Additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2012 results include selection to compete in the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV, competition; additional Stryker Double-V Hull vehicles; a new LAV and tank export programs for an array of international customers, including nearly 200 tanks for Morocco.","In March, our general tactical vehicles team delivered our proposal for the JLTV competition for the Army. This combat-proven, off-the-shelf vehicle, EAGLE by name, has already been deployed successfully in Afghanistan by German forces. It incorporates the unparalleled protection of Double-V Hull technology and is a reliable, operationally cost-effective, low-risk offering, which aligns with the Army Secretary's priorities for faster, smarter, cheaper and better solutions.","For the year, I expect -- I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales. Full year operating margins will be pressured due to the impact of the adjustment made this quarter and will likely be closer to the high 13% range.","Next, I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems revenues were $1.6 billion, down 4% from last year due to less T-AKE and Littoral Combat Ship volume, as these construction programs near completion, and lower Virginia class sales as we transition from the second to the third block of submarines. Increased ship repair revenues, following the October 2011 acquisition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, helped to mitigate the decline in construction programs.","Operating earnings were $185 million, up nearly 11% compared to a year ago. Marine Systems' 11.5% operating margins were a 150 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. The favorable earnings and margins are due to improved performance on the T-AKE and Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, auxiliary program.","The 13th T-AKE, Medgar Evers, successfully completed sea trials last month and was just delivered to the customer yesterday. The 14th and final T-AKE, Cesar Chavez, will launch in May and deliver before year end.","The first MLP, Montford Point, now 51% complete, remains on schedule and budget to deliver in May 2013. This ship is demonstrating the value of completing ship design before starting construction.  We began construction of the second MLP, John Glenn, last week, and received a contract to build the third ship, Lewis B. Puller, into the quarter. ","In addition to these NASSCO programs, we continue to see the group focus on cost efficiency, overhead management and risk reduction in our other 2 shipyards. At Electric Boat, Mississippi, the ninth Virginia-class submarine, recently completed alpha, and bravo sea trials and is due to be delivered to the customer nearly one year ahead of schedule and under contract costs.  ","AT BIW, the first Zumwalt-class destroyer, DDG 1000, is over 60% complete, while the second ship recently named USS Lyndon B. Johnson, is 30% complete, and fabrication of the third ship has just begun.  We remain focused on ensuring construction success and are working closely with the Navy and other major suppliers on ship integration efforts.","The Marine group's backlog totaled $18 billion at the end of the quarter. Our shipyards added several key orders to their workload in the quarter, including an additional DDG 51 and the third MLP.","The Navy's updated 30-year shipbuilding plan provides several opportunities to enhance the group's backlog over the next few years. This revised plan includes a multiyear procurement for 9 DDG 51s between 2013 and 2017, and a block buy of 9 Virginia-class submarines known as Block IV between 2014 and 2018. We expect the Navy to award these contracts next year. ","As part of the new shipbuilding outlook, we will also continue to work on several development programs, including the Ohio ballistic missile submarine replacement effort and a new program called the Virginia payload module, which will provide additional payload capacity for Block V Virginia-class submarines. The Navy's outlook also includes an additional MLP ship, the fourth in the class, planned for FY '14. ","Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of revenues slightly below 2011. Also, as the T-AKE program winds down through the remainder of this year, I continue to anticipate some margin compression. However, given the group's strong first quarter performance, I anticipate margins will be closer to the high 10% range for the year.","Now IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group had a challenging first quarter, as many of the negative trends that we experienced in 2011 persisted. Group revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, down primarily as a result of weakness in our technical communications portfolio. Volume in our IT Service business was flat year-over-year, as the addition of several businesses in 2011, including Vangent, offset lower workload on several major IT infrastructure support projects that are concluding.","There are several reasons for the continued softness in our Communications business, including further award delays in our shorter-cycle products, especially encryption hardware; slower-than-anticipated ramp in programs moving from development to production, like JTRS and WIN-T; and the slower-than-anticipated transition of some legacy contracts to new awards, particularly Common Hardware Systems-4, CHS-4 program. In each case, we expect gradual improvement activity as the year progresses. ","As it relates to encryption, persistent and dynamic threats to vital national networks require continued upgrades and updates to encryption equipment. Because of the mandate for regular investment in these products, we view this shortfall as largely a timing issue.","On development programs, our JTRS HMS and WIN-T programs continue to demonstrate their capability in the first quarter, including deployment of our HMS Rifleman radio to Afghanistan, with the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. In the past 6 months, WIN-T Increment 2 has made great strides through its formal milestones, including successful government production and reliability testing. ","Both JTRS and WIN-T remain on track to progress through further testing and acquisition milestone decisions this year. Additionally, both programs were well funded in the FY '12 budget and received strong support, totaling nearly $2 billion in the FY '13 request. We expect to receive FY '12 funded awards for WIN-T, as well as Rifleman and Manpack radios later this year.","With respect to contract transition, CHS-3 was a very successful program that exceeded its original ceiling cap value several times. We were awarded a $3.7 billion, 5-year, single-source, IDIQ contract for the CHS-4 program last summer. CHS-4 is an extremely flexible contract that purchasers from across the military and other government agencies can use to acquire the latest, ruggedized, commercial computing and communications technology.  Following last summer's award, we had limited activity under the new CHS-4 contract. We are now finally beginning to receive some orders.","IS&T's lower sales volume impacted earnings and margins, which were $218 million and 8.9% respectively. While both were down from last year's first quarter, the margin decline was due primarily to program mix. With the addition of Vangent in late 2011 and the continued top line pressure in our communications product portfolio, services now represent the largest component of our IS&T portfolio.  ","While IT service work provides an excellent return on investment, margins on these types of programs are generally lower than more product-intensive programs. The IS&T group continues to aggressively manage its cost structure to protect profitability and competitiveness through actions such as facility consolidation, workforce reduction and discretionary spending reductions. These actions could afford some operating leverage when delayed volume returns.","IS&T's backlog was $9.6 billion at the end of the quarter. While order activity improved from the fourth quarter, it was not at the level of prior years. We did, however, book several awards, some of which are detailed in today's press release, which highlight our ability to capture opportunities in high-priority growth areas, including cybersecurity, cloud computing, health IT and IT mission services. ","When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contract totaled $32 billion. For the reasons I just outlined, I anticipate award activity to improve as the year progresses, and then point-of-fact, we've already seen some positive indications in April. ","For instance, earlier this month, we received a 4-year, $173 million Rescue 21 sustainment award. Also, last week, our tactical communications business received a 10-year IDIQ contract with the FAA worth potentially $400 million to deliver radios to enhance air traffic controller communications. And we recently received long-lead funding to provide security systems for buildings and infrastructures in Saudi Arabia. This is the beginning of a multiphase several hundred million dollar project. Awards are starting to break free, albeit slowly.","In light of IS&T's slow start to the year, we now expect group sales to be approximately 5% lower in 2011, with margins in the mid-9% range. Revenues and earnings will be back half weighted.","Now let's talk about Aerospace. Aerospace growth continued in the first quarter, with revenues of $1.6 billion, up 20% from last year's first quarter. This healthy top line growth was driven by more large cabin deliveries, including G650s and continued growth in aircraft service demand. ","The additional large cabin deliveries also grew double digit improvement in the group's operating earnings, which were $271 million. Margins were 16.7%, down modestly when compared with the prior-year period because of lower liquidated damages and higher R&D expense. Earnings and margins were up sequentially due to improved performance at jet aviation.","Gulfstream orders were good this quarter, representing demand for products across our portfolio. Customer interest remains strongest at the upper end of our portfolio, although we are seeing improved interest in the G280 as entry into service approaches and the mid-cabin market slowly improves.","Orders from our North American customers comprise the largest percent of orders in the quarter, a noteworthy development preferred by corporations taking steps to recapitalize their fleet. We also continue to see strong demand from Asia-Pacific customers.","First quarter gross new the aircraft book-to-bill was 0.7x on a dollar-denominated basis. Orders continue to significantly outpace default. Default activity was driven by a few additional G650 cancellations, which filled in to 2012 from customers who were billed for milestone payments following the aircraft's provisional-type certification late last year.  Consistent with my fourth quarter remarks, the G650 defaults are in line with our expectations. And even in light of G650 deliveries and defaults over the past 2 quarters, we still have close to 200 in backlog. ","At quarter end, the group's backlog was approximately $17 billion, down from, year-end, due in part to the G650 default activity I just mentioned, but still very robust by any measure. Because new orders for the G650 currently have a 5-year entry into service date, we don't expect orders to match planned deliveries in the near term. ","Continued demand for our G450 and 550 products keeps us in our target 18- to 24-month window from new aircraft orders to delivery for these aircraft.  The decline in Aerospace as backlog in the quarter also reflected the cancellation of a wide-body Jet Aviation completion project, following the death of a customer.","Aircraft flight utilization trended up in the first quarter, with a particularly strong March finish. This positive trend enabled service revenues at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation to post gains over last year's first and last quarters.  We continue to make investments in our service network to better correlate our footprint with growth in the installed global base. ","For instance, Gulfstream recently announced the planned opening of Gulfstream Beijing, a joint venture, which enables Gulfstream to be the first business jet manufacturer to offer factory service in China. This facility complements an authorized Gulfstream repair center in Hong Kong, as well as Jet Aviation's newly upgraded MRO and FBO locations in Singapore. Similarly, Gulfstream and Flight Safety International have teamed to open a new flight simulator in Hong Kong. This center will train Asian operators on G450 and G550 aircraft, enabling them to complete training much closer to home.","In addition to the stronger service volume I just discussed, Jet Aviation's completions business made positive progress in the quarter. We delivered 1 of the 3 narrow-body\/wide-body aircraft that had experienced significant cost growth. We will deliver the second shortly -- actually, almost any day now, and we expect to have the third aircraft delivered by the end of the second quarter. The new jet leadership team remains focused on capturing narrow-body\/wide-body completions opportunities, while simultaneously optimizing the business to better align with today's market conditions.","Gulfstream's G650 and G280 development programs continue to make progress in their respective flight test programs in the first quarter and remain on track for type certification in the midyear, perhaps moving into the third quarter. We're in the final stages of testing with the FAA, so the exact date of type certifications will really be determined by their schedule. Rest assured, however, that we are getting close, and both aircraft continue to perform extremely well.","Entry into service for these aircraft, particularly the G650, continues to drive my Aerospace guidance of approximately 15% top line growth. Given the strong performance in the first quarter, particularly at Gulfstream, Aerospace margins will likely be somewhat higher than my original guidance, probably in the mid-15% range for the year.","In summary, given the environment I detailed and our current outlook, I am reiterating my full year guidance of $7.10 to $7.20. With that said, in light of the company's first quarter results, we'll most likely come in at the lower end of this guidance range. And as I detailed at the group level, the composition of the earnings has changed slightly. I would remind you that this guidance does not anticipate the result of capital deployment.","As we look to the rest of the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in defense. However, our businesses are focused on execution and remain agile and well positioned to adapt to the dynamic defense environment confronting our industry. Meanwhile, our Aerospace group is  well situated to continue a steady growth trajectory, fueled by demand for our large-cabin, in-service Gulfstream aircraft, the entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft and increased global demand for the group's aircraft permits.","Our diverse portfolio, healthy balance sheet and cash outlook afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.","With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial [indiscernible]. Hugh?","L. Hugh Redd","Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Before we start the question-and-answer period, I'd like to cover a few additional financial items, including some more detailed discussion of the $67 million adjustment in the Combat Systems segment. ","And let me start there. This adjustment is the result of human error, which we've caught and have now corrected. We have accounting policies and procedures and systems in place throughout all our operations. Unfortunately, sometimes, individuals fail to follow them. I should mention that this was limited to and isolated in our European-Land-Systems-based -- Switzerland-based vehicle business. ","Beginning in late 2010 and spread over every quarter in the interim, there were 2 central accounting issues. I want to remind everyone that they were accounting issues, not performance issues. First, revenue was recognized in excess of the contract value on 3 contracts due to foreign exchange costs that were improperly accounted for. And second, revenue was recognized on costs that were not properly recorded to cost of sales, but rather, remained in CIP. We have evaluated this adjustment, the quantitative and the qualitative impact of the adjustment on the current quarter, prior quarters and the full year earnings, and we've determined that it was not material.","Moving on to net interest expense, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million versus $34 million in 2011. For 2012 we expect net interest expense to be at the lower end of our range of $155 million to $160 million. At the end of the quarter, we had just over $900 million of net debt, down just over $100 million from year-end. The effective tax rate was 31.3% for the quarter compared with 31% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year, the effective tax rate should approximate 32%, rising slightly over 2011 due primarily to the lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit.","We plan to contribute $500 million to our pension plans in 2012. Funding will be the greatest in the second and third quarter, the first installment of approximately $100 million having been made in early April. ","Finally, now that we've seen one quarter of run rate, we are lowering our forecast of corporate expense, which is shown in the segment detail of operating earnings in Exhibit B to the press release. We're revising that forecast to $70 million down from the $80 million we were forecasting at the beginning of the year. ","Amy, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the questions and answers.","Amy  Gilliland","[Operator Instructions] Jeff, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jay, could you talk a little bit more about the sensitivity at IS&T? You've adjusted the guidance given the pressure. How do we think about a CR in the fourth quarter might -- how that might further affect things?","Jay L. Johnson","First of all, as I think we've probably talked before, we see the likelihood of a CR very high. So I think that will be the reality we deal with later in the year. But I will say that we've had a slow start as I described in IS&T, but we are starting to see award activity. My guidance assumes the resumption of my terms here, what I would call more normal activity as the rest of the year progresses. We have indications that, that is still going to be the case. The encryption business, as I described, will have to move here at a certain time, because you just can't put that off, but so long. So that was the basis of my timing statement. The communications programs, specifically WIN-T and JTRS, are in the test at NIE next month, and we expect LRIP-II decisions that are in the plan. We have every indication that's going to happen here, May, June timeframe or slightly thereafter. That's 6,000 Riflemen radios and more Manpacks. So we feel pretty confident that, that's going to happen. So what am I saying? I'm saying then that we see enough daylight ahead of us, even in front of the fog bank, and feel that a CR at the end of the year, based on what we have already appropriated, if you will, in 2012, will put us in pretty good shape just to go through that fog bank with the guidance I've just delivered. Okay?","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Would you characterize IS&T as having greater uncertainty than Combat at this point?","Jay L. Johnson","I think, yes, of course. And why do I say that? Because, again, it's the shorter-cycle business, and it's been the one that's been, shall we say, most exposed here. Through the CRs -- look at it this way. I don't want to over-dramatize here and say perfect storm scenario, but in a way, you could almost make that case when you say, \"Look, we've had 2 CRs in the last year. We're likely to have another one. We've got the reality of award delays.\" We got -- because of that or part of that is protracted acquisition cycles. You got this fog bank as sequestration out there. And then we've got programs that were mature and very successful concluding Pentagon [ph] renovation, Rescue 21, CHS-3, the Walter Reed here in DC. So that being replaced by other programs -- these are good programs, but they are slow to pick up the ramp, if you will, and the margins will probably be a little challenge relative to the old mature programs until they get rolling. But still in all, that scenario, I can see it through what appropriated in 2012 in a way that makes us confident that the guidance is very achievable. Could it change? Sure it could change, but right now, the best vision we have says, we think we can get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Actually, I wanted to put a finer point on the other question. I guess, as we -- can you just help us reconcile a little bit, Jay, sort of what seems to be conflicting puts and takes between you're talking about budget cuts affecting execution and anxiety escalating? And then revenues and margins in IS&T being back half-weighted and award activity improving. And I'd also love if you could touch on top of that. Talk to us about what's happening with award fees in general. Where are you today versus a year ago and versus maybe 2 or 3 years ago?","Jay L. Johnson","Okay. Let see, Heidi. We do believe that it's going to be back-half-weighted. I mean, one of the reasons I took the guidance down was because of what we're seeing so far. So if you take my guidance down 5% as I just did, and then you look at the rest of the year as I just described to Rob, is there uncertainty out there? You bet you. But again, if the appropriated funds are obligated, we believe this is a good piece of guidance for IS&T. As we've discussed and will continue to discuss, I'm sure as the year goes on, the fog bank becomes more real the closer we get to it. But again, I was -- to be very honest with you, 3 weeks ago, I was more concerned about it, it being 2012 execution, than I am today just because we are starting to see some award activity that was frankly absent in the first part in the majority of the first quarter. So am I enthused about that? I'm gratified by it, and I'm hopeful for it, but you know, the check's in the mail to a certain extent here until we see, as I mentioned before, more sustained \"normal activity\" going forward. And that ties back to the obligation of appropriated fund. So it's going to be a very, I think, dynamic is probably a fair way to say it, year, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T business. But I'm giving you the straightest we have right now on the view that we see out forward. The award fees in general, and that I don't see frankly -- I guess, the comment I would make would be the competition you see, in particularly, the IT Service business is as intense or more intense than it's ever been. So there, I think, Heidi, is where you're seeing a lot of that. That accounted for -- the IT Service business is probably about 1\/3 of the decline in my forecast. The Tac Communications business was probably 50% to 60% of that decline, and part of that decline in IT service frankly is biz lost, my term, in this hypercompetitive environment which gets to your point on these.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one last follow-up.  Jay, when we -- you sort of -- I guess, when you talk about the 5% guidance down and obviously, we wonder whether that's sufficient, can we at least have the understanding that you've baked enough cushion in the other divisions that could have potential offset to what we're seeing or potential worsening in IS&T?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes. I think -- I mean, my answer to that, Heidi, is yes. And if you look at -- I see opportunity, and I've used a little of guidance in Aerospace and Marine, in both. And I'm very -- at this point, I feel good, confident about Combat Systems, in terms of absorbing the impact of what happened with the accounting issue at ELS. But the 3 U.S. businesses were essentially on and on. So I think yes. That's a long yes to your answer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay, back on IS&T, you talked about service being a bigger portion now and that impacting the margins. Can you give us a break out of service versus product? And given the bigger portion at service now, or normalized margins when IS&T kind of get back to somewhat normal here? Or are normal margin's going to be more in the 9% range on a go-forward basis?","Jay L. Johnson","9% to 10% is probably -- what I have in my head right now is a fair answer. To your earlier point. Were talking, right? Given the, shall we say, pullback or delay in the tactical communication and the product business in IS&T, the service side of it takes 40%, 45%. It becomes -- you're approaching half of the IS&T book is in the Service business with great business, as I said in my remarks, great return on the investment, but at a lower margin.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then in Gulfstream, you commented that North America was pretty strong. Can you give us a break out how much North America, actually -- how much of total orders were North America in the quarter?","Jay L. Johnson","For the quarter, it's about 60%, so -- and I've talked about that some in the past, but I think it's really good for everybody to see that coming back. And even better, when you match that to the other statement I made, which is if not North America replacing Rest of World, Rest of World is still doing great, but North America is also coming back now, which is, I say, a good sign for everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jay, on the Aerospace division, I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing situation in the quarter, whether you've seen any improvement there, and how it differed from model to model and even region to region.","Jay L. Johnson","Pricing did you say?","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Jay L. Johnson","Okay. Right now, the pricing is very strong on the large cabin. That's a consistent statement. That hasn't changed. And frankly, I don't see it changing, both 450 and 550 for us. The mid-cabin market as we see it, based on the activity levels and listening and talking to the other OEMs, I think for us, it's improving, but still a bit challenged, I guess, is a fair way to say it. We're seeing 280 activity. The 150 activity for us was slow in the early part of the quarter, and it picked up in the latter part of the quarter. So that's a good thing. I hope that's responsive to your question.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, and just a follow-up. With the strong pricing and the continued strength in the backlog for the 450 and the 550, what point, do you think, can we anticipate production heading higher?","Jay L. Johnson","We've got a pretty good chance of having it about right now, because as I mentioned, we're still in kind of a 18- to 24-month sweet spot backlog. And as long as that's the case, I think we've got the production rate about right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It's been Finbar Sheehy for Doug. As you mentioned earlier, in Washington, there seems to be a broad agreement that sequestration would be bad, but no clear path to avoid it. At what point during the year do you need to have contingency plans in place, just in case they actually don't manage to avoid it? And how do you think about what sort of actions you could take, especially given the sequestration, if it ever happens, could be quite short lived or not?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes. That's a tough one to give a crisp answer to, because we don't know the frame of the template that we're going to be dealing with. Suffice it to say that as I've said previously here, I think the challenge for us, the responsibility, really, for all of us, is to stay committed to executing the appropriations that have been laid forth for the year. And if we can continue to do that, there's reasonable news in entering as I say, that fog-bank-called sequestration out there. How it manifests itself, nobody knows. How do you prepare for that? It's really tough. But what you do is you maintain your agility, you keep running your business, you control your costs as best you can, you stay focused on execution, and you don't overcommit yourself with capital, I think, in that kind of an environment. And that's about the best protection I believe you could give yourself coming into something that is unknown as what we're seeing right now.","Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on a specific aspect. You mentioned about restructuring in European Land Systems. Can you give us a sense for the scope and scale of that? Sort of how far you are along in it? And whether the restructuring costs might be a drag on margins this year?","Jay L. Johnson","No, to your latter. And it's been a work in progress quite honestly for quite some time. Example would be the movement which we executed late last year of the ELS headquarters from Vienna to Madrid. So we're attending to that, basically all around. And it's continuous work. And it'll continue to occur as we move forward, but it's not impacting our margins right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jay, I guess, I want to take a different tack, which is -- that if I look at your guidance and I see Marine margins up, Aerospace up, even with the volume cut at IS&T, you mentioned interest expense in the lower end and corporate expense in the lower end, it would seem as though, actually, you should be higher, not at the low-end. And so I'm just trying -- are you forecasting a contingency of a continuing resolution? Is it haircutting, that IS&T could be worse? Where are you hedging? Because it would seem like it actually should point higher, not lower.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I appreciate that, Sam. And I would just tell you that I think particularly, as it applies in IS&T, we like what we're seeing. We just haven't seen enough of it. That's a fair way to say it. I mean, it's early in the year. There's starting to be movement. We're starting to obligate the appropriated funds. We're starting to see that. That's a good thing. If that continues, okay. Then maybe I can feel differently. But right now, in terms of where within the $7.10 to $7.20 band we are, but right now to be honest with you, I haven't seen enough of that goodness, and I've got the $0.13 dividend. That just was the reality here in the first quarter. That's what puts me at the low-end. I'd love to outperform that. And I'm hopeful that we can. But I'm just not ready to write that check yet.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, it sounded like when you mentioned the 650 and 280 type certification that it perhaps it flips into third quarter. What's happened there? It just seems like it's moved a little bit to the right.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, it has -- I mean, to be fair. And it's frankly just a matter of scheduling and executing a very detailed test regimen with our partners in the FAA. I mean, that's pure and simple. And may we do it better than that, yes. But right now, with the testing, we see that they want to have -- I'm just -- I'm hedging it a little bit. I'm not worried about it. It's just a matter of -- and it's not just a matter of getting type certification, okay. You get type certification, then you have to get the simulators certified, then you have to get the crews for the airplanes that are entering into service type rated, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a fairly complex set of realities you have to be dealt with, starting, of course, with getting the type certification. So if it happens, second quarter or third quarter, to me, I'm happy either way it's coming, the airplanes are performing beautifully and there's great enthusiasm for them out there. So I'm not hedging it, because I see a problem. I'm just hedging it because of the reality of the testing and the pacing of that testing. This isn't the only thing the FAA has to do either. So I'm just being sensitive to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Jay, on that score with the G650, have they done the test that caused the problem, that caused the crash last year?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, we've done those, yes. I mean, we've done most, all of the, as I would characterize it, company testing. But the protocols are such that you do it, and then you analyze it, and then the FAA works with you, and you do it again. So it's a series of sequential events that have to occur here. And so that's I think the answer that you were looking for.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","And then a quick follow-up, were forfeitures at Aero around $20 million? And is the jet completion business still have a loss this quarter?","Jay L. Johnson","Sorry, I missed the first part of that, George.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Were the forfeitures at Aero about $20 million from the G650 cancellations?","Jay L. Johnson","I don't quantify that. But I've been very consistent here in saying that we expected a number of G650 cancellations once the PPC call was made. And we got basically what we expected. So Gulfstream piece of that is in line. The reason I brought up the other for the Aerospace and backlog is because it was a big jet that fell out of the backlog, because of, frankly, the death of a customer.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","And did the completions business have a loss yet in the first quarter?","Jay L. Johnson","No, completions business is doing -- is on plan. And I'll take the opportunity to say that you didn't ask this, but I mentioned, we've delivered 1 of the 3 aircraft. I would tell you that the -- just to reaffirm to everybody and to my folks at Jet that the feedback I'm getting first hand on the quality of those airplanes, and what they've done is spectacular.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on Jet Aviation. You talked about the deliveries of some of the challenged planes going forward. Can you just talk a little bit more in detail around the timing and the margin recovery of Jet? Just kind of update us on where we are? And when you think that Jet will reach normalized margin rates? And what more do you need to get that done?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, as I said, Jason, I think before that what I expect out of Jet this year is essentially breakeven, and then we ramp from there. And right now, I feel pretty good about that. In fact, I feel very good about that. The real challenge in the completions business, quite honestly, will no longer be our ability to manage the throughput. It's to fill the skyline. So what am I saying? I'm saying if the business is out there, we've got the protocols and processes in place now to really nail that business, okay, which is good news for everybody. I'm really proud of what they're doing now. And the challenge will be if the customer demand is there. And we're working on that very seriously, as you would expect.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick one on Jet, on the wide-body cancellation. Was there any P&L impact as a result of that in the quarter? Or was it just the backlog?","Jay L. Johnson","Mostly backlog. Maybe just a smidgen on the quarter. To be honest with you, I can't -- I don't even have the number in my head, but it's not material. It's mostly just backlog, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just didn't know if there was a big forfeiture, I mean, in one time. And secondly, I know there's a lot of discussion on The Hill about Abrams and the facility and the budgeting there. I wondered if you might provide us an update with how you see that playing out, and what risk there may be in the guidance, should you not see the sort of plus up, you guys were trying to get similar to last year.","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think I'm not worried about the 2012 piece. We've got work to do as I mentioned before in 2013. But I would say that it's pretty consistent here, in terms of the concern -- that Abrams has generated with JSMC Lima regarding the whole issue of defense industrial base going forward. And we've had, as recently as yesterday I think, I read in the clips this morning, 170 members of Congress signed a letter to Secretary Panetta expressing their concern on this issue, which says, frankly, this defense industrial base, as we go into this full fog bank and deal with the new realities that everybody's challenged with, the defense industrial base is elemental to that discussion. So from our standpoint, of course, we think that totally appropriate and must be part of the calculus, and we're very encouraged by it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You had some pretty significant management announcements over the last several weeks. And Jay, I'm wondering if you might comment on a, on how you and Phebe will be working together in her new role. How do you envision this role? And any update you can provide, given this announcement, on succession plans for the company? And also any comments you might have on the new head of your Shipholding business?","Jay L. Johnson","You're not trying to push me out the door, are you, Joe?","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Not at all. Just want to get the updates, pretty big announcement.","Jay L. Johnson","Now, listen, first of all, just to refresh, next week, the 2nd of May, to be precise, Phebe Novakovic does become the President and COO, working directly for me. As you would expect, that's the start of a very disciplined succession rhythm here, if you will. She and I are spending a lot of time together as you would hope. And I'm very anxious to get started here, frankly. We spent a lot of time with my direct reports now, executive vice presidents, senior vice presidents with Phebe. And so the transition is beginning, and we're very encouraged by all of that, so -- and we'll continue to work very closely together as you would hope. Likewise, Phoebe is in the process as we speak of turning over Marine Systems group to John Casey, who is currently President of Electric Boat. And then John will be turning over EB to Kevin Poitras, as you probably know. In every one of those moves, we're very well served. And John's going to do a superb job as EVP, and Kevin will do likewise as the President of Electric Boat. So it reaffirms, frankly, the bench strength of General Dynamics and how seriously we take the succession business. And we feel very comfortable with all of that, Joe.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, Are there any comments you can make on just how you and Phebe will be working together day-to-day on running the company? Are you going to maintain a focus on different areas than her? Or are you going to make joint decisions? Or how do we think about how you're going to divide the executive responsibilities?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, one of the things she'll be doing, first-order, of course, as you would expect, is spending a lot of time with the other executive vice presidents, if you will, and the businesses, getting herself, shall we say, refamiliarized, because she's fairly been total focused in the Marine group as was her task -- to get her now snapped in, if you will, resnapped in to the other 3 business groups. So as first order business that would be elemental to what she's doing. And she and I will work very closely throughout all of that as will the rest of the leadership team. So this is teamwork underlying.","Amy  Gilliland","And Jeff, I think we have time for one more question this morning.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So you had very strong large biz jet deliveries in the first quarter. Could you comment, what are you looking for, for the year? Is there upside, given that's very strong first quarter, unless it was bloated by huge forfeitures, which you're seeming suggesting isn't the case, isn't 15.5% a conservative number?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, I always give you conservative numbers, Cai. But, I mean, it's a pretty reasonable number from what I see today. Is there some upside to it? I certainly hope so and I think there probably is. But I think that's reasonable today, quite honestly.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I mean, you haven't told us. I mean, are you looking for more large biz jet deliveries? You said that completions were on plan, but you didn't say whether it was in -- jet was in the black. You say you expect it to only breakeven for the year, so a little hard to kind of see the rollout from here.","Jay L. Johnson","I think the completions -- the production rate, as I think I always say, can be -- it's unchanged today. Can it be tweaked a little bit? Yes, as we go through the year. Will it be? It's too early to tell. That's a fair answer.","Amy  Gilliland","Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.","Please note that this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Moss, Vice President and Controller. Please go ahead, sir.","William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Denise, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'd like to start by sharing with everyone that Phebe is not able to be here today as she was unfortunately hit with a bad case of the flu. She's asked me to cover today's call, and I've invited our Controller, Bill Moss, to join me. We all wish Phebe a full and speedy recovery. But for now, let's get on with the results.","As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.58 billion; operating earnings of $1.052 billion; and income from continuing operations of $764 million, a 10.1% return on sales. The EPS performance was $0.16 better than the year ago quarter and $0.09 better than consensus. Against the year ago quarter, revenue was down $77 million, or 1%, but operating earnings were up $37 million, a 3.6% increase; and income from continuing operations was up $33 million, a 4.5% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 13.9% is 60 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016. Once again, we enjoyed very positive operating leverage.","Sequentially, revenue was down $95 million, or 1.2%, while operating earnings were down $4 million and operating margin was up 10 basis points. From an operating perspective, the second and third quarters look a lot alike as we said they would. The $0.07 EPS improvement was driven by a modestly lower share count and a 180-basis point lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $211 million, less than 1%. However, operating earnings are up $177 million, or 6%, and operating margins are up 90 basis points. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations are also up $177 million, or 8.4%; and earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.71, 10.5% better year-to-date.","With respect to cash, we had very efficient conversion in the quarter. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $871 million and free cash flow from operations of $751 million. For the year-to-date, we have cash flow from operations slightly in excess of $1.6 billion.","As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, an important story in the quarter was the very healthy backlog increase. The total backlog of $63.9 billion is a $5.4 billion increase, in excess of 9% over the second quarter. There was very good contract activity in all of our groups, with particularly strong order intake in the Marine group. I should point out that each of our defense businesses enjoyed backlog growth, with the exception of NASSCO, and it didn't miss by much.","Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $70 million, or 3.6%, compared to the third quarter of 2016; and operating earnings increased $8 million, or 2.1%, to $385 million on an operating margin of 19.3%. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $83 million less in revenue, about 4%, and a $40 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to a 120-basis point contraction in margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $157 million, or 2.6%; and operating earnings are up $120 million, or 10.6%, on a 150-basis point improvement in operating margin.","We had good order intake in the quarter for the group of 0.8 to 1 book to bill measured on a dollar value of orders basis. But Gulfstream alone was a 0.9 to 1 book to bill on both a dollar value and a number of units basis. I can also tell you that our pipeline and active sale discussions are quite good. We're, again, reasonably optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter and I expect it to look much like the third quarter, if not somewhat better.","Our certification flying continues to progress well, including the additional test points required to extend the G500 and G600 range. As we announced during the recent NBAA Air show, additional testing has enabled us to increase the G500 range by 200 nautical miles at 0.85 mach and 600 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. It's really quite remarkable that the G500, with a 5200-nautical mile range at 0.85 mach, can travel 4400 nautical miles at 0.90. This was the approximate range of the G450 at 0.80 mach.","On the G600, our additional validation tests have proven an additional 300 nautical miles at 0.85 mach as well as 300 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. The additional testing required for the specific fuel consumption and center of gravity test points have ensured proper performance and safety margins in both aircraft. Although this lengthened the program schedule, we believe the resultant value to our customers was worth the effort.","While flying has progressed on schedule, testing by one of our suppliers for component level qualification associated with the concurrent FAA and EASA certification has added a new complexity at the end of the program. While we accounted for this type of supplier impact in our plan, one of our suppliers apparently didn't anticipate the additional EASA test requirements and is somewhat behind. We expect to resolve this issue and deliver the G500 to our customers as planned. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. So we're still on track and we continue to monitor the supplier closely as we near the end of the certification program.","Turning to Combat Systems, the group had an excellent quarter with revenue of $1.5 billion, operating earnings of $247 million, and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. As you would expect, the quarter-over-quarter, sequential, and year-to-date comparisons are all quite favorable. Compared to third quarter of 2016, revenue was up $173 million, or 13%, and earnings were up $38 million, or 18.2%, on an 80-basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $86 million, or 6.1%, and operating earnings were up $22 million, or 9.8%, on a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2016 by $332 million, or 8.6%. Operating earnings are up $76 million, or 12.6%, on a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin.","Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year. We fully anticipate that the fourth quarter will see around a 15% increase in revenue over this quarter, but also some degradation in operating margin as a result of a mix shift to new programs, so that the increase in operating earnings will be more modest than the revenue increase. All of our major programs are performing very well. We continue to see opportunities for growth both internationally and domestically for the group.","The Marine group reported revenue of $1.93 billion, a $144 million or 6.9% decrease compared to the year ago quarter. Similarly, revenue was down sequentially by $148 million, or 7.1%, and year-to-date revenue of $5.94 billion was lower by $231 million, or 3.7%. Revenue across the year has been down based on Virginia-class Block III timing, a slowdown in the Columbia program design work as a result of extended negotiations over the IPPD contract, and the wind down of some of the commercial work at NASSCO. These revenue headwinds are now largely behind us.","Operating earnings for the third quarter, that's $179 million, were down by $18 million compared to last year's quarter. On a sequential basis, the group's operating margins improved 70 basis points, which led to a $1 million increase in operating earnings despite the $148 million decrease in revenue. It's very nice to have margins in the group north of 9% once again. While this is encouraging, we'll have to see whether it's sustainable.","And finally, IS&T. While IS&T's revenue at $2.15 billion was down $176 million or 7.6% against last year's quarter, it was up $50 million sequentially. Year-to-date revenue of $6.4 billion is down $469 million or 6.8% over last year. However, we expect a strong fourth quarter and we'll be especially flat with 2016 for the year. Revenue has been lower during the year primarily on timing. Lower than expected army product sales impacted the third quarter and the Army had trouble executing after the six-month CR and, of course, the change in administration slowed some execution as well. We'll recover a lot of this revenue in the fourth quarter but don't have enough time to recover at all. Some anticipated revenue will slip into next year, but we're in a good position to hold 2017 revenue close to the 2016 level.","In sharp contrast, operating earnings of $253 million were up $14 million, or 5.9%, compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 140- basis point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings were up $13 million (sic) [$14 million] (10:43) or 11.7% operating margins, which is a 30-basis point improvement. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings are up $19 million, a 2.7% increase, on a 110-basis point improvement in the operating margins. So IS&T has managed to overcome less than anticipated revenue with very strong operating performance.","So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned? We fully expect the fourth quarter to look much like the other three from an operating earnings perspective. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate in the quarter, leading to a lower reported EPS. For the year, stronger than expected operating results year-to-date, a lower than planned tax rate, and a modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations now goes to a range from $9.75 to $9.80. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow.","And finally, in closing, as tempting as it is at this time of year to ask about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall, when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you last January was grounded in that process and, as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from us in detail in January, as has been our custom for many years.","I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill to cover some additional financial items.","William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Jason. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, which includes the impact of the issuance of $1 billion of debt in the third quarter in anticipation of the repayment of $900 million in notes maturing in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 25.8% year-to-date. We're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of approximately 27%. The lower rate in the quarter and our reduced forecast for the year are both attributable to the finalization of open tax years and a greater benefit from employee stock option exercises than previously forecast.","On the capital deployment front, in the third quarter we purchased 1.2 million shares, bringing us to 5.9 million shares in the first nine months of 2017 for $1.1 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first nine months, we've spent $1.9 billion or nearly 120% of our free cash flow year-to-date. We've also made a number of small acquisitions in our aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $364 million. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and a net debt position of $2.2 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approach 100% of earnings from continuing operations, and will continue to deploy 100% of that free cash flow, less the amount spent on acquisitions, to dividends and share repurchases.","With that, we will move to the Q&A. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Denise, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I would be happy to, sir. And the first question will come from Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Jason and everyone else.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good Morning.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Wondering if you wouldn't \u2013 going into a little bit more detail on the supplier issue on the G500 and just kind of let us know whether this is a sole-source kind of position for this supplier or maybe a little bit more color on what kind of part this might be. And more specifically even on 2018, kind of when in the year you expect at this point for deliveries to make and whether you'll continue kind of plugging along on production at this point so that expectations around deliveries for the full year of 2018 are kind of no different than where we were, say, back in July during the last earnings call? Thanks.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. So first off, I'm really not at liberty to get into any specifics around the specific supplier. That's somewhat confidential information that Gulfstream needs to deal with. But I can tell you that this is not an issue that has to do with anything related to flight tests or the flying capabilities or the readiness of the airplane to go into service. This is strictly a paperwork exercise that we're going through and, really, it has to do with, as we've noted, the additional test points that have allowed the additional range as well as I mentioned the simultaneous \u2013 this is the first time we've done a simultaneous FAA and EASA \u2013 that's the European Aviation Authority (sic) [European Aviation Safety Agency] (16:19) \u2013 certification. And really, that is a benefit to our customers, to achieve those simultaneous certifications so that we can accommodate the deliveries to our international customers. But long story short, this is not any type of risk item to the program. It's strictly a matter of getting through paperwork through that certification process.","As it relates to 2018, as I mentioned, deliveries are still on schedule with our original plan and our original contractual customer dates. You may recall that for a while there we were optimistically considering that there might be an opportunity to advance that entry into service by three or four months. We had this opportunity to go after additional capability in the aircraft, and we did that knowing that we would still be able to meet our original customer commitments while achieving that additional capability. So really, no impact there. And likewise to your question, no impact on our expected 2018 delivery. The production and the delivery schedule remain intact as we originally anticipated, and so we don't see any modification there.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So Jason, I wanted to ask you about Marine. You talked a little bit about the nice uptick in the backlog there. And at the very end of the quarter, I think you took in a big Columbia order and then two destroyers, one Flight II and one Flight III. I'm curious how much risk you see and the impact on margins from this AMDR Flight III Destroyer, and in the margin profile on Columbia as we go forward here. It may not matter that much this year. I know you don't want to get into 2018, but I'm interested in the margin progression given that these destroyers are fixed-price incentive fee contracts and that we're bringing in this Columbia work.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. So as we've talked about, and I think you hit on it, the Columbia I think is the primary driver that we'll see, if for no other reason, just the volume impact it has as we continue to grow in the Marine Systems group throughout the balance of the decade. And as we've talked about, it is a development cost-plus type contract, so it will come at relatively lower margins that will continue to have a modest dilutive effect for the group. So that's no different I think than what we've talked about up to this point. It's good to have that contract in place so we can keep moving forward, but the margin impact is consistent with what we've talked about historically.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Jason, is there a way to quantify the mix of Columbia as a percentage of Marine as we go forward here?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","I don't have that in front of me. What I can tell you is that the growth profile that we laid out, which, really, we anticipated being off a little bit this year in volume and then picking up in 2018 and beyond until the end of the decade, the growth profile, if you follow that CAGR, is almost entirely attributable to Columbia. And it's essentially this design work. So you can put some orders of magnitude on it around there as it relates to the growth of the business and those relatively diluted margins.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then just Flight III versus II. It's something that we think about as being higher risk.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. So it's obviously a relatively significant change to the platform, with the additional radar capabilities. But we feel like we got to a place with the customer where we balanced the need to meet their requirements with the maturity of our design, and it's a balanced risk and opportunity situation. We feel very comfortable with the estimate we've put forth and we wouldn't have put a bid in if we didn't think we could do that. So we're still coming out of, as we've long talked about, some of the issues we had at Bath Iron Works with the four-year production break on the DDG-51 Destroyer line. So we feel very good about the progress they've made. We've got to keep watching that and making progress to see that it's sustainable, but we see this as fitting in very nicely to that book of business. I think we have seven destroyers in backlog at this point of the DDG-51 variety, and we think this is very wholesome for Bath Iron Works.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So you can hold margins as you transition on that program?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","I have every reason to believe that, yes.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to follow-up on the G500 question from earlier. I appreciate that you guys are on plan with regard to the original target entry into service date. A year ago on the call the company talked about the G500 making a significant contribution. I assume that meant to EBIT in 2018. Is that still the case?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Absolutely. Nothing has come off that. And so recall, there's been a lot of discussion around, is EIS going to be at the end of 2017, beginning of 2018 \u2013 we were talking about EIS as a demonstrator model because of the demand requirements that our sales organization was having. And so there's been a lot of back-and-forth over when is the first unit going to be there and what's that going to look like. But fundamentally, two things. With the new revenue recognition protocol, that was never going to be a big impact on 2017, hence the more significant impact in 2018 that we described. And as I said at the outset in the earlier question, the production and delivery schedule we're still adhering to and are on track for. So continue to see 500 ramp-up in 2018 as having a meaningful impact as we draw down. We'll deliver the last 450 in January of next year. We'll continue to draw down the 550 and we'll start to feather out a couple of 650s. So the 500 is a major contributor among those factors.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then Jason, maybe if you could just describe the acquisitions that you made, kind of what they are and how much they're contributing.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. So we've had a number over the year. They've been mostly small in nature. The more recent one was a business in our IS&T group, really out of our IT services business. And it specializes in mission support for the intelligence community, so it fits right in our core as it relates to the GDIT services and a growth market for us. It closed right near the end of the third quarter, in mid to late September, so not really much of an impact. In fact, no really impact at all in the third quarter but we'll expect to see that to start to contribute in the fourth quarter and beyond. The other acquisitions were a couple of small aerospace services business and another mission computing business that we acquired earlier in the year at smaller amounts.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Rob Epstein (sic) [Ron Epstein] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning, Jason.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Hey. Good morning.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just maybe a bigger question for you. When you look at the balance sheet of the corporation, right, you guys are really not very levered at all. And when you think about the efficiency of the balance sheet, is there more you could be doing with it?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","We've spoken for some time about the fact that, A, we don't have a target balance sheet leverage position; we really are more focused on a couple of things. Number one is maintaining the balance sheet firepower that we have for strategic opportunities that will enable long-term growth. So with the free cash flow we have and the balance sheet capacity that we've had, we've been able to do things like invest in capital facilities, invest in product development across the portfolio, Gulfstream, now Electric Boat in the facility. As well as of course deploy meaningful amounts of capital; in this case, primarily to shareholders in the form of dividends and the share repurchase.","I think as we look forward, a couple of things. We like our credit rating, where we stand today, and we don't look to modify that. But certainly, we see the balance sheet as an opportunity for when and if strategic opportunities come up, that we are ready to be agile and move quickly with those opportunities. You saw that in a small dose here in the first nine months. That's a little bit more of a toe in the water compared to where we've been for the past few years. Where that leads us, we'll see. It really is all about continuing to find accretive opportunities that are in our core, and that's really never changed. That's always been the case and that really is what we hold that balance sheet firepower for.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And is it safe to assume if there aren't accretive opportunities that come along that you guys are interested in, you would pick up the return to shareholders either through the dividend or the buyback?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","So we'll continue to evaluate that on an annual basis. Right now, that continues to be our cadence through the balance of the year. I'm sure you've heard Phebe talk about priorities on capital deployment, that the dividend should be predictable and repeatable and sustainable, so we'll look to continue that. And share repurchase, of course, as always, we do not view that as a strategy. It's been a tactical approach to how we deploy capital, and we'll continue to frankly take it that way. So I think no real change that I foresee in that regard.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Yes, thank you very much. So if you're late, there've been some rumors that the G500 might not deliver until midyear. Do you expect to deliver in the first quarter still? And if there is an additional delay, what kind of impact do you expect that to have on cash? And lastly, your competitor, the 5X at Falcon, clearly has had another extended delay. Do you expect or have you seen any pickup in orders as a result of that? Thanks.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","So I don't know of anything about the 500 delay until midyear. Like I said, we remain on track for deliveries in the early part of 2018. So rumors are rumors. I don't necessarily want to speak to that kind of speculation but we remain on track with our contractual delivery timing. And so as it relates to further delays, it would also be, I think, somewhat speculative. I don't know what that would look like, and frankly don't anticipate them, so I don't see an impact to cash or otherwise associated. We are on track and feel good about our ability to close on the certification and get the airplane into service in accordance with our original contractual commitments.","As it relates to competition, we tend not to speculate about them or gauge our performance based on what others are doing. It's fair to say over the past couple of years that we have been the beneficiary of taking some share in this market. It's not something we focus on; it's just a fact. But obviously, if they continue to have issues, if others continue to have issues, we'll continue to do our best to perform and be as competitive as we can be in this market.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Thanks so much.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Absolutely.","Operator","The next question will be from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just part one on cash flow, if I could. I think you mentioned that cash flow return in the form dividends and share repurchase would be 100%, but now it would be 100% after your spend on acquisitions, which I think is a nuance to your price. I'm asking you to just confirm that. And secondly, on the cash flow in the quarter and the full year, did you do the pension contribution in 3Q and what in particular is going to allow you to get to 100% for the full year in 4Q? Thanks.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. So on the first question, you read that correctly. It may be a subtlety that we're articulating because it's relevant in the moment, but it's always been our approach that, with respect to capital deployment, I mentioned a minute ago the dividend approach, that steady and repeatable M&A is there if and when we find accretive and core acquisitions, and then the residual from a tactical standpoint is share repurchase. So I don't think that's any different than what we've talked about; it's just that they've become relevant as you've seen it here in the third quarter of this year. So that is absolutely the case. As it relates to pension, we did make our scheduled pension contribution so no change to the outlook. With respect to that, for the year I believe the number was somewhere in the ballpark of $200 million. I don't think that's changed.","And as it relates to closing out the year, we've got a big fourth quarter lined up but frankly that's not unusual for us. It's a pretty typical pattern for us. And one of the things we, I think, would look to as the biggest driver behind the ramp there in the fourth quarter is the transition to billing and delivery and collection on these major international programs is starting to unwind a good bit of that working capital in the fourth quarter. That's the single biggest driver that brings us down that curve.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just to clarify. So if M&A continues to be a few $100 million at a time though, that's actually subtractive from the 100% return and the balance sheet kind of just gets preserved in terms of the leverage you currently have and there's no net increase in leverage from M&A?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","I don't want to speak to long-term leverage. We'll get into that depending on the deals that may be out there. I think as it relates to the impact on share repurchase, as I've said, that's always tactical. And while we targeted a 100% return between dividends and share repurchase modified by the acquisition activity, that's a rough number because it's tactical; it's something we shoot for. If it were a penpoint, sort of bullet point at the target, then it wouldn't be tactical; we'd be driving toward a fixed answer. And if you look back over the past couple years, we've in fact well exceeded the 100% return benchmark, and this year we're on target to meet that. So I don't know that it has any direct implication. We'll just have to assess each of those opportunities when they come up and see what they do with respect to the implications on the long-term leverage.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just want to talk about the fourth quarter in terms of some of the comments you made. So you said Combat could be up 15% sequentially. That means it's up, call it, 5.5% to 6%. And for the year, that seems like it's a little bit lower than the 7% plan. I just want to make sure I'm doing that correctly. And then second, in IS&T, with this big ramp-up in the fourth quarter, I'm wondering how much of that 20-something percent year-over-year growth that you need to get is coming from this acquisition versus the remainder of the business?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. So I'd have to check, and we can go back offline and discuss the math, but the 15-ish percent increase sequentially is entirely consistent with our original forecast of the Combat Systems group being up 7%, maybe a touch higher, approximately 7% full year over 2016. So we're very comfortable with that and that's in the backlog. As a relates to IS&T, as I've said, it is a steep curve in the quarter but we feel very good about it. The pieces are in place to achieve that growth. There are a lot of moving parts but it's in the backlog. We had a good September which leads us to feel like we're very well-positioned to close out the year in a strong fashion. Most of that growth is coming out of the products business, and the order cadence is there to support that. So again, while there's a lot of moving parts, we feel very good about where we are and the pieces are in place to get there.","In terms of the impact of the acquisition, I would say that's not the big driver. It has an impact, but to be honest with you I don't actually have that number in front of me. The big driver is the catch up from the timing we've seen throughout the year and its impact that it's had on our Mission Systems product business. We've talked a good bit about those timing effects of the Army procurement and some of the civil agencies and so on that we've seen delayed by the six-month-plus CR and so on. But we feel good about that timing starting to catch back up this year. If we don't get fully back to the 2016 level, it'll be close and that timing will just spill over a little bit into 2018.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to stay on IS&T because you're talking about some real progress there, but at the same time we've seen the Army decision to halt WINT-T and you all didn't make it through the down select on JTRS. How are you looking at Army communications now longer-term? Is this an area where \u2013 I mean, how should we expect those program situations to affect IS&T longer-term? And is this an area that you perhaps need to shore up or invest in?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. So look, I think bottom line, when you think about this tactical network backbone for the Army, that is absolutely as square in our core as anything else that's out there, and so we feel very good about the fact that we will continue to be a player from a systems integration role moving forward. Obviously, the Army is yet to define what its revised tactical networking baseline is going to be, so we don't want to get out ahead of that. But as we see it right now, the decisions that have been made to-date and what's on the table at this point has a minimal revenue impact, if any, to 2018. So we feel very comfortable with where we're headed for 2018.","And frankly, beyond that, the impact will depend on future Army decisions, so it probably wouldn't be appropriate to speculate and get out ahead of them at this point. What I can tell you, as you are well aware, IS&T is a makeup of a vast portfolio of lots of different opportunities and programs. And so even this one, if it has some impact, is not going to be one that changes our overall long-term outlook for the group. So we feel comfortable that our multi-year CAGR for the group, which I think we gave you at 4.5% or so, remains intact at this point.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So that's good; even if you should not get back in on whatever replaces WIN-T, you still feel pretty good about that growth level.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","We do feel good. Yes.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, Jason.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Hey. Good morning, Carter. How are you?","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Good. I wonder if you could expand, since it's not in the release, but with respect to the margin strength, was there anything to note from a gross favorable, EAC adjustments or anything like that? Maybe you could give us some color on how those looked favorable versus unfavorable by segment just to kind of give us some color on what was in there in the margins.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. I don't have it by segment in front of me. I know the number in aggregate for the quarter was right around $100 million, which was off a little bit from the second quarter but higher than the first quarter, and that's, of course, right in line with the increased variability we anticipated seeing with these changes under the new revenue recognition model. It did have a good favorable effect on IS&T. I think we had 11.7% margins in the quarter for IS&T. That's not likely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, albeit the margins will continue to be strong for the group in the fourth quarter, but we'll see that come back down a little bit.","A little bit of an impact in Combat Systems but not too, too much with respect to changes in estimates or true ups. And in Marine Systems, we did see a couple of modest, albeit a handful of booking rate changes on some of those programs which, in this case, all just happen to line up positively, and so you saw the strong margin in Marine Systems in the quarter. So I would frankly expect to see the Marine Systems margin tick back down a little bit in the fourth quarter but still to show good progress in those yards.","So bottom line, it had an effect. It was favorable to the quarter but not in an outsized way compared to where we've been in the past. And again, barring a similar trend in the fourth quarter, we expect to see some of those margins notch back down just a little bit to a range that we consider to be more normal.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Jason, I thought I would just follow-up on the M&A that you did this year. I know it's relatively small, but does this signal that you're perhaps a little bit more open to do deals going forward? Or does this show that some of the prices have come in relative to what you think is fair, or that some specific assets came up for sale?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. I really don't think this signals any difference in our perspective or our approach to the market. While we've been fairly quiet on this front for the past few years, it doesn't mean that there hasn't been sort of activity under the surface in terms of looking and evaluating things that are out there. As I've said before, we will continue and will always look at deals that are accretive and are in our core, whether they're large or small. And in this case, a couple of them happen to come in. To speculate about what the future would look like would probably be getting a little bit out ahead of ourselves because I really just don't see what that is. But this will always be our approach until I'm told that it's not. And it's just, again, a focus on accretive core deals and we'll announce them as they come.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just a follow-up. When you say accretive, are you talking earnings accretive, free cash accretive, and over what period? Is it by year two or something like that?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","So specifically, earnings accretive in the first full year. Obviously, if you bring it in late in the year it's going to have a hard time overcoming that geometry. But, yeah, accretive in the first full year and that's earnings accretive and, of course, the cash to follow.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, Jason. Can you update us on your expectation for Gulfstream mid and large cabin deliveries for this year?","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. No change from what we've talked about earlier. We're still looking to be right at about 120 deliveries for the year. I think if I recall, I don't have it right in front of me, but that's 89 or 90 large cabin and 30 or 31 mid cabin, so that remains unchanged. Obviously, as you get toward the end of the year, you could see a unit flip back or forth, so we'll manage that. But right in line at this point as we look at the balance of the year.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Just as a follow-up. I was wondering if you're seeing any improvement at all in emerging market demand at Gulfstream.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","The markets continue to be solid for us. We've sort of hit a familiar drumbeat, right, throughout the past several quarters and even the past couple years. Emerging markets are showing signs of activity. Our core continues to be North America, and that's where over half of our order activity and backlog is centered. But we're seeing, I'd say, probably another quarter of the activity associated with Asia, Asia Pacific. And then if you take other regions notching down, I'd say Europe, then Latin America, then Mideast Africa, sort of in that order in decreasing amounts. But we are seeing decent order uptick activity and customer interest around the globe.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, Jason. Thanks for taking my question.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Just within Combat Systems, good revenue growth and good EBIT growth. Can you just attribute that to specific international programs, what the ramp should look like? And you mentioned the margin impact. Maybe if you could walk us through what the impact is, any productivity savings off that. Thank you.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. So the growth in the group so far this year has really largely been attributable to the ramp in the international programs that we've discussed. We've started the delivery process for those programs. And in fact, we're now up at full rate production for the large Middle East program coming out of Canada. We've started to make initial deliveries on \u2013 I think we've made the first handful of deliveries on the UK AJAX program. That will start to build rate and come up to full rate throughout and toward the end of next year, so you'll see some ramp next year attributable to that, and that'll sustain out through the next couple of years and beyond. The Middle East international program, as I've said, is at full rate and will be pretty steady state for the next couple of years. And now we're starting to see the startup of US domestic ground forces recap, and we'll see that more of an influence in the fourth quarter. So I would expect more of the growth that we see in the fourth quarter to be about those programs.","And really, that dovetails into your margin question because we'll start to see those coming in at traditional sort of US Defense entry-level program margins, and so that'll have somewhat of a dilutive effect on the Combat Systems group margins in the fourth quarter as we start up those programs. So a really nice layering of the international programs, the Middle East having a big effect this year, Army recap starting this year and moving into next year, and then the UK program ramping next year and beyond. So I think it's a wholesome position for Combat to be in and supported by the tremendous backlog that they see in that group.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jason W.

Number one is if the money is there to support it, absolutely. I would tell you that we have the capacity to move the rate up, so we're at a steady two per year now in the foreseeable future. There is conversation around what to do in years when a Columbia submarine is delivered, and so we'll have to see if there's opportunity from a budget standpoint to add Virginia-class there. But bottom line, we stand ready to do that. We have the capacity to do it and it frankly comes at a relatively minimal investment. The investments at this point moving forward that we're evaluating for Electric Boat really have to do with the Block V module \u2013 for the Virginia Payload Module on the next Virginia-class contract \u2013 and, of course, the Columbia investments, all of which we're in the process of discussing with the Navy.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.

As always any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. ","Jason Aiken","Thanks, Erin and good morning. I'd like to open by congratulating Phebe on welcoming her first grandchild into the world yesterday. Mother, son and grandmother are all doing well. Phebe is with the newest edition to her family right now, but she left us well-prepared to report our results on this call. I'd also like to welcome Kim Kuryea, our Vice President and Controller to the call and thank her for joining me today. Congratulations Phebe, welcome Kim, now let's get started. ","Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share, on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million. The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower than anticipated tax provision. Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter, by 5.4% and 7.8% respectively. ","Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%. So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%. ","Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million and similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14. ","So all-in all a very solid quarter, with good performance all around. The marine group's improved performance, both quarter over quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter. ","For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87, on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full-year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD. Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat less than 0.5%. Operating earnings on the other hand are up $131 million or 3.1%, on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. ","Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%. This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower than anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment. ","Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was in fact less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for two reasons. ","First, we were working off the very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program. And second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and pre-production parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, beginning this year. ","In 2017 we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon. ","Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter over quarter and sequentially. Against the year-ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3%, as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat, as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin. ","For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion, with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on 120 basis point improvement in margins. All in all, a very good year at aerospace, with strong operating leverage and decent order intake, particularly good in the last half of the year. ","This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015. Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8 to 1 dollar-based and 0.9 to 1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream. ","All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint and interest in the G500 and G600 is increasing nicely, as we get closer to entry into service with these aircraft. ","At combat systems, revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5% and operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over quarter basis. Sequentially, the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%. ","For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%; however operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6%, on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins. ","Overall, combat systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame, as we begin delivering on our backlog. ","Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3%, compared to the year-ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year-ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially. ","Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that three-year period. ","On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins, so the story here is a good quarter on both a quarter-over quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better than anticipated revenue, but not as good as expected operating margin which left us relatively flat year over year. ","In the information systems and technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales. ","For the year, revenue was up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9%, on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T. ","On this call a year ago, on a Company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%. We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%. ","Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better than planned operating performance, $0.25 from a lower than planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a very solid year by any measure. ","So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well, will flow from the restatement of 2016 which is found in Exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim? ","Kim Kuryea","Thanks, Jason and good morning. I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our combat systems group, given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the Euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016. ","As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with the strengthening U.S. dollar. ","Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million, compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, interest expense was $91 million, versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities which resulted in slightly lower interest income. ","For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full-year effect of the increased debt and the lower cash positions. We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities which I'll walk through in just a minute. ","Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated, principally due to the higher than expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year. As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape. ","Let's move on to our pension plans. We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early 1980s. ","Finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year, we spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016, at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6 times our free cash flow from operations for the year. ","Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now, I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change. ","On January 1 of this year, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard, ASC topic 606 which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a five-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis. ","For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time, similar to what we've done in the past, under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for overtime revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time. ","As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have two notable impacts on our contract portfolio. The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years. ","In 2016 and prior, we use what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method. As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period, such as in our marine systems group. ","The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft, when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service. ","This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. Our past practice had two revenue recognition points at two distinct contractual milestones, green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. It's important to note that these two changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts. ","Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in Exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release. ","Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results, so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis. I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release, but as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers. ","Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follows suit. The biggest driver of this change is in aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release. Since under the new standard, revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower, as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted. Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries. ","On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year, there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries. ","So the question is, how will all of this impact aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly, but in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries, in excess of the completed deliveries, should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter. ","That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule. ","So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries, in any period. Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned earlier in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that in some circumstances alters when we recognize revenue and earnings, but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts. ","When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior, everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point, may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period, but if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the Company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through a new lens, so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results. ","Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance. ","Jason Aiken","Okay thanks, Kim. So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020, initially by business group and then a Company-wide roll up. This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the three-year period subsequent to 2017, so I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period, as well. ","In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated, but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion, with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules, as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending, as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales. ","In aerospace for the five year period, 2016 through 2020, that is 2016 as restated, we expect the sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019, with significant growth in 2020. For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. These percentages are of course imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting, however, we believe they are directionally accurate. ","In combat systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%. For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%. ","Combat systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low rate initial production, into full scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed. ","The marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016, as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million, with an operating margin rate around 8.6%. The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5%, with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%. ","Finally in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3% respectively. So Company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%. Operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%. And operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated. ","Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision as Kim mentioned and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 for fully-diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rules. ","With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years. Divide our guidance by four, then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter and that should give you the rough progression. ","So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price. ","For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a roll up of the projections I've given you for the business groups, so we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments. ","Now, let me end my remarks there and we'll start taking your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. ","Jason Gursky","Jason, maybe you could just provide a little bit more color on the dynamics that you've seen at Gulfstream, starting off with the perhaps order activity on the 500 and 600, what you saw in the quarter? You talked a little bit about a robust pipeline and then just talk about the profitability there and the trajectory for that into the out years. We talked about $1.6 billion for this year with a nice CAGR going forward. So what does the shape of that hockey stick look like as we move out into 2020? Thanks. ","Jason Aiken","Sure, so look as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is, as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entry into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up, so we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the EIS, their respective EIS dates. ","Overall as I said it's not just order activity which again we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity into what we think of as the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out. We have talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed and as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1 which gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective. ","With respect to your question about the out years, as I mentioned you saw you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out year period, I think what we see is, as we're transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in 2018 and the 600 starting in 2019, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service and we'll see more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020, when both of them are fully up and have ramped into the production. ","Operator","The next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. ","Sam Pearlstein","Jason, can you talk a little bit about the free cash flow conversion you mentioned, returning to 100% in 2017? It's a multi-part but does it continue through the planning period and can you address CapEx specifically over that period? Because I'm just trying to think about how CapEx ramps around the Columbia class ramp-up during that period. ","Jason Aiken","Sure, certainly, as we've been signaling through this couple of year period, where we have seen lighter than our traditional cash flow conversion, it has been our expectation, our forecast that we would be back to our traditional 100% conversion rate starting in 2017. We have a high degree of confidence in that and we actually do see that as a sustaining trend. This is not a one-time thing, but we do expect to be able to keep up that level of conversion in that range throughout this planning horizon that I described. ","As it relates to free cash flow or excuse me, CapEx, typically somewhere in the ballpark of 2% of revenues is where we tend to end up around CapEx. That of course depends upon the timing and phasing of various projects across the business, so it can perturbate a little bit back and forth. But certainly what's coming on the horizon with Ohio will bring with it some investment. We're still in the very early phases of discussing what the profile and timing of that looks like with the Navy and so I don't think we're prepared to discuss any type of outsized CapEx investment in any one year, beyond what I just described. But it certainly, we do not see it affect any of that overall conversion rate through the planning horizon that I just described. ","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. ","Peter Arment","Jason, on Gulfstream is there a way that looks like to quantify how many jets have shifted out of 2016 into 2017? Looks like from a completion standpoint it's more like 10 aircraft. Is there a way you can help us bridge that? And then also regarding just a clarification on the G500 expecting certification this year and initial green deliveries, are we expecting any completed deliveries? Thanks. ","Jason Aiken","Sure. So you're pretty much right as it relates to the green aircraft shifting from 2016 into 2017 and that's really what Kim was alluding to. Again do keep in mind that green aircraft will shift, including G500 green aircraft, will shift from 2017 into 2018. So this is something that I think is more of an issue in this immediate transition as you try to think about 2016 prior to restatement and 2016 under the restatement and then how you take that restated 2016 to then project 2017. ","I will point out one notion. Of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta between the green and outfitted airplanes. We do have a number of, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs and those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go through a completion, so there's a natural delta there and I'm sure Erin can give you numbers after the call, if we need to get into that level of detail. ","As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program and we're still targeting certification and entry into service, meaning outfitted delivery prior to the end of the year. ","Operator","The next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. ","Myles Walton","Jason, the restatement in the accounting had a material impact on the non Aerospace businesses on 2016, but I think in the Q, as related to the restatement of 2015, it didn't really. So can you walk us through why the restatement had the effect on 2016 but not on 2015 in a material way and walk us through that one? ","Jason Aiken","Sure. Look, as Kim described there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process, because there's a lot of smaller puts and takes, but the big ticket item is this move from the prospective method of accounting for these changes in our long term estimates, to the cumulative catch up method. ","So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to, that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective. Because what's happening here, every quarter every year across the portfolio of these programs, we're performing updates to our estimates to complete and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs. ","So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers who have pretty much all been on this method, even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch up method than we have experienced under the perspective method. I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the reporter of magnitude, if you compare them to us historically, 2 times or so the level of quarterly profit adjustment-type impacts on the results. ","Am I saying, that's what we will see in the future? I wouldn't be foolish enough to try and predict that but it's all going to depend what happens in a given quarter. What you saw in 2016 was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the prospective method in those periods, but when you take them all in one lump sum, they just drove a little bit more of that anomaly, a little bit more of that perturbation from quarter to quarter. ","So this is what we're going to frankly have to get into in a little more detail with you in the future, when and if these things happen. And as we said, we fully expect that somewhat increased level on volatility on a quarterly basis, to be part of our story in the future. ","Operator","The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. ","Ron Epstein","Just maybe a broader big picture question, when you're willing to offer a plan like that, that goes out a couple years, a lot of companies won't do that and it's a change for you, obviously. How do we think about the conservatism that's built in as you step out over year one, year two, year three? Given I'm certain you are conservative, but how should we think about the conservatism built in that you are willing to share that with us? Does that make any sense? ","Jason Aiken","It does. I would suggest this up front. There's nothing that's changed about anything you can infer about the historic current or future conservatism of this Company. It is what it is. I think the couple key points, those longer term out year CAGRs and forecasts that I directionally gave you, those are strictly rolled up from the operating plan, as submitted by our business units. So this is what each of those individual business unit presidents sees, as they look out over their horizon, mine their backlog and determine the trajectory of their businesses. ","We're seeing, frankly, a very good news story that we're bullish on across that period and so given the restatement here in the period and the fact that you're having to retune 2016 as you now look at and evaluate 2017, we frankly just thought it would be useful for you to get a little bit more of a picture, so you weren't left in isolation with the two data points make a trend or not, because that could be a tough expectation for anybody assessing the results. ","So we wanted to show you a little bit more directional color on where we see the businesses going. And we think as we see that type of growth now coming over that period across the Company and really shared by all four of our business groups, that combined with the demonstrated operating leverage we think we've been able to bring to bear, really offers us some great earnings trajectory over that midterm planning horizon. ","Ron Epstein","One follow on, if I may. When you look back over what happened in the fourth quarter, did you see a pick up in pipeline activity, tire kicking, however you want to call it, post the election at Gulfstream? ","Jason Aiken","I have not heard anything anecdotal specific to that from the guys down at Gulfstream. As I said, the fourth quarter was very encouraging both from order and pipeline activity standpoint, but I certainly don't think I have enough color to attribute that either to post election or otherwise. ","Operator","The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. ","Cai von Rumohr","So in aerospace, you noted that the accounting change would have a negative impact on 2017 and yet looking at the numbers, it looks like there are 16 more green deliveries of large biz jets where you make your money, so that if those catch up you pick up 16, that's the math, in 2017 and if you are really going to get a G500 out the door and booked into revenue in 2017, by my math, it would look like this would actually have a positive impact, because there's 16 planes where the greens happen, the greens happened already, so you basically pick up the 80% on those 16 planes. So help us understand that, if you could. ","Jason Aiken","Sure, so the planes you refer to, as I mentioned, the 16 is a little bit of an overstatement because they were somewhere in the ballpark of a half dozen or more handful of these special mission airplanes that don't flow into completions so they are done and out. But again I think the key to remember is, what we're trying to do here in the moment and this I believe is last time we'll do this, because green deliveries, will just fade out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment, as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instinct might be, as you've articulated, that wow you get to recount the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016. ","But you have to keep in mind, that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that's that natural flow of the business. And if you think of this as a steady in production model, the 650 to 550 to 450 to 280, you'd expect that similar cadence coming out the other end. So if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral or close to it anyway, where Kim articulated it as a modest headwind and when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind, it's not a business headwind. ","What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine a G500 entry into service before the end of the year, there's quite naturally a handful of green G500s that are incremental to those in production aircraft, that are also going to tilt out of 2017 and into 2018, so on balance, we would see more of an outflow if you will or a tilt out of the year in 2017 on the back end, because of that phenomenon around the entry into service of the G500. Even then we're seeing as a tilt in flow from the end of 2016 into 2017. So hence our attempt to try to high pressure you understand in the moment, as we transition, what the impact of the shift of the new rules is on Gulfstream. ","Operator","The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. ","Carter Copeland","Jason, I wondered if you could just clarify the adjustments in marine on the restatement were obviously quite large and the go-forward margin that you're implying for 2017 in the mid 8s is a bit different than we've seen in recent years. Was there something about a booking rate change or anything from the shift away from perspective there, that's a go-forward difference that we should be noting or is that just coincidental? ","Jason Aiken","I think really there's nothing, as I mentioned before. In the moment, when you look at individual quarterly performance and in this case try to examine the difference between how the results looked under the perspective method and the [indiscernible] catch up method it's really a function of what were the booking rate changes on those programs, in that portfolio, in the moment. So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had on balance favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio, on balance had some negative booking rate changes. ","Again under the prospective method, as you are well aware and we talked about many types that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually nil effect in the moment when you make those changes. You can see in the results, it had more volatile effect under the cume catch up method. I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates or the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think. ","Really it's a function of, as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the Bath shipyard on the settlement of the A12 program and some of the work we're doing on the DDG1000, as well as restart of the 51 program there. So that's well documented and discussed and we're working our way through that and we have every expectation we'll get that shipyard back to where we want it to be, as quickly as we can. So that's one influence and the other is of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost-plus Columbia class development effort, that of course is going to be dilutive in terms of margins, with respect to how it compares to fixed price full rate production programs, so that's really more what you're seeing going forward. ","Operator","The next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. ","David Strauss","Jason, with regard to the long term forecast for the defense businesses, obviously, you guys have had to make some assumption around the budget over the next couple of years. Can you talk about what you assume there, if it's just sequestration or not? And then on aerospace, it might be helpful just to kind of calibrate us, if you could talk about over that planning period what the ranges of completed deliveries, I guess more importantly, large cabin completed deliveries? Thanks. ","Jason Aiken","Sure, so look as it relates to the Defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assumed than what we're seeing which is notionally upward directional budgets that underpin and support the defense programs across-the-board. Really what it's about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the Company and now we're all about executing that backlog. ","So a good share of what you see, particularly in combat systems and in marine systems is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described. ","As it relates to aerospace, so I alluded to before, if I had to guess and I don't want to commit Phebe but I'm fairly certain, this will probably be the last time we talk about green deliveries, because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point right now as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range from a large cabin perspective of call it 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries and from a mid-cabin perspective, somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond one year because we set production rates and work through those customer contracts on an annual basis, so we'll continue to update that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017. ","Operator","The next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. ","Howard Rubel","On your backlog, it's down a little bit sequentially and I know some of that's attributable to timing. Could you do two things for us, Jason? One, provide us with a little bit of an indication of the pipeline for combat systems? We know there's a lot of things in the FMS pipeline. And then second, how do you see, you talked a little bit about Gulfstream, but where are some of the open slots for opportunities for sales? ","Jason Aiken","Sure. So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially and something important to point out there, particularly as it relates to combat systems. Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group, as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there's equally, if not more so, an impact on what you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is the backlog. And so we saw something on the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in combat systems backlog in 2016, as a result of that FX headwind. So that gives you a sense of what's happening there. ","In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right. It is quite robust, both on the domestic and the international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8x8 vehicle in the UK, there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really the list goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for combat systems, as it relates to international programs. ","Domestically, we're looking forward to the ramp up with recapitalization efforts and so on, as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker Lethality, with the 30-millimeter gun, Abrams upgrades, Marine Corps Labs, really it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again both domestically and across-the-board internationally. So really exciting to see. ","Your last part of your question, aerospace slots, I think fundamentally the thing, the way to think about this is, with the good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains essentially consistent with where we were last time, 24 months or so. The 550 remains in the 12 month range, 450, we actually only had one aircraft left to sell so we should get that behind us this quarter which by the way I think is a great testament to this transition and the way Gulfstream has handled this. ","When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one end there was the speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would? And certainly, the test program it's demonstrating so far that it's meeting if not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane can do and Phebe mentioned a quarter ago, we've now officially pulled that EIS in from first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017. ","So that's on one end of the spectrum, but this point about one 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, the inventories and so on to close that out in a timely and secure fashion, without exposing the Company and manage this transition and so far so good. So that is really encouraging, so that's what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft. ","Erin Linnihan","Great. Thank you for joining our call today.

My name is Lacey, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, Lacey, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter Conference Call.","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a strong quarter at General Dynamics with revenues of $7.9 billion and net income of $640 million. We reported EPS of $1.81 per diluted share, $0.04 ahead of the year ago quarter and $0.19 better than the prior quarter. This was also $0.19 per share better than consensus.","Revenue, for all practical purposes, was the same as Q2 2012 and significantly higher than the prior quarter. Revenue for each of our operating groups was higher than the year ago quarter except for Combat Systems, which reached a recent high watermark in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, Aerospace, IS&T and Marine were ahead of the first quarter. Combat was essentially flat with Q1.","Operating margin was a strong 12.1% with good contribution and sequential improvement across all 4 of our groups.","Net earnings and earnings per share were ahead of both Q2 2012 and the prior quarter, aided by lower interest expense and somewhat offset lower share count in part by a higher tax rate for the quarter.","Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2013. Revenues are down modestly against 2012. However, net earnings are up over 1%, and diluted earnings per share are up 9% or 2.7 -- $0.09 or 2.7%. In short, we're off to a good start ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations.","With respect to cash, we had $486 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter, about 76% of net income. We had $915 million for the first half, still 76% of net income.","In Q2, we repurchased slightly over 6.6 million shares for $513.3 million. Recall that in the first quarter, we had $70 million of purchases that cleared and was reported in Q2. Similarly, we had $100 million of share repurchases in this quarter that cleared in early Q3 and will be reported in Q3 cash flow.","For purposes of discussion, if we include that $100 million I just mentioned, we have repurchased over 7.6 million shares for about $584.5 million in the first half.","In addition, if we add the Q2 dividend, you might recall that there was none in Q1 because it was paid in the fourth quarter of last year, we have returned $782 million of the $915 million, over 85% of the free cash flow year-to-date to our shareholders.","Let's turn to the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I also want to give you some general perspective on outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and then close with our EPS guidance for '13.","First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a powerful quarter with the highest revenue, operating earnings and operating margins reported in the last 6 quarters. We had good contribution from Jet Aviation, and Gulfstream's performance was superb.","Just to provide you a bit of color. Gulfstream enjoyed 170 basis point improvement over the prior quarter in G650 green manufacturing that more than offset a modest mix shift. Also, our 3 large-cabin models enjoyed a sequential 330 basis point improvement in outfitted or completions margin, a clear indication of progress on G650 completion.","For the first half of 2013, Aerospace revenues are up $616 million or 19.2%. Operating earnings are up $171 million, 32.4%, a clear manifestation of Jet Aviation's return to profitability and the performance improvement at Gulfstream. This is all reflected in the 180 basis point improvement operating margins for the first half of the year versus the first half of 2012.","This was really outstanding. But as I previously said, we don't expect the third quarter to be this strong for 3 reasons: First, we will experience cost increases on several G450 and G550 supply contracts, which will compress margin. Second, due largely to the vagaries of production planning, we plan to produce 2 fewer large-cabin aircraft in the third quarter. Third, we are delivering more green mid-cabin in the quarter, resulting in a mix shift in delivering the lower-margin airplane.","Our expectation in the fourth quarter is that we will return to Q2 production levels and improved learning on the G650 line should offset somewhat the cost increases in the 450 and 550 supply chain.","Combat Systems. Combat demonstrated the disciplined performance of a good cyclical, reporting 14.1% margins on revenue, almost 28% lower than the year ago quarter. Land Systems and OTS had particularly strong margins on cost reduction initiatives and program performance. ELS was impacted by an additional restructuring charge of $18 million that was accelerated into the first half. On a pro forma basis that is not considering the restructuring charge, Combat operating margins were 20 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2012 and 140 basis points better than the prior quarter. All in all, a strong performance in a tough market environment.","The story for the first half is much the same. Revenues are off 23.6% against last year, but operating earnings are down only 17.5% on 110 basis points of improved operating margin. And as I said, the performance of a good cyclical.","In the second half, we should see an increase in revenue and a boost to operating margins as ELS returns to profitability. Its restructuring charges are complete.","Marine group. Marine group revenues were higher than Q2 2012 and the prior quarter. However, operating earnings and operating margins were down 2.7% and 100 basis points, respectively, entirely as a result of the completion of the high-margin T-AKE program in 2012. Nevertheless, operating earnings were up 11.9% sequentially and operating margins at 10.1% or 30 basis points higher on good performance across each one of our businesses.","For the first half, Marine group revenues are up $127 million or almost 4% and operating earnings are down $31 million or 8.4%, solely attributable to the absence of T-AKE profit.","In the second half, we expect revenues to approach the first half. Margins should be slightly lower.","IS&T. IS&T is a good news story from a revenue perspective. Revenues were higher this quarter than in the second quarter 2012 as well as the prior quarter in a tough market, primarily with respect to our Army customer. The revenues of each operating unit within the group improved sequentially.","Operating earnings and margins are down against second quarter 2012 by $28 million and 100 basis points, respectively, but up slightly against the prior quarter. The operating result was driven by poor margins at C4 Systems, primarily attributable to the expenses in the U.K. business that is now embedded in C4 Systems. We expect stronger C4 margin performance in the second half.","The story is much the same for the first half. Revenues are up $29 million, less than 1%, but operating earnings are down $61 million, 13.7%, for the reasons I just noted.","For the remainder of the year, IS&T should see a little bit less revenues than we had in the first half with earnings up somewhat and a modest increase in operating margin.","Let me turn to our guidance for the remainder of 2013. The guidance I gave you at the beginning of the year of $6.60 to $6.70 per diluted share did not include the impact of sequestration, if any. The enactment of the 2013 bill went a long way towards stabilizing our program funding and mitigating some of the uncertainty for 2013.","Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we are increasing our guidance to $6.85 to $6.95 of earnings per diluted share. The lower end of the guidance anticipates our current understanding of the impacts of sequestration in 2013 and a CR for our fourth quarter. If sequestration's impact this year becomes more draconian than we can currently envision or a CR is implemented in a more rigid fashion than we can anticipate, we will revise our estimate. The upper end of the range anticipates that the impact on contract execution from furlough actions affecting our customers is mitigated as the year progresses.","So in summary, this guidance implies that EPS for the second half will be similar to the first half in a range between $3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share. The fourth quarter should be the stronger of the 2 quarters.","I'd now like to turn the mic over to Hugh Redd, our CFO.","L. Hugh Redd","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning, everyone. Net interest expense was $18 million for the quarter versus $37 million in 2012. For 2013, we expect net interest expense of approximately $85 million, reflecting the full year impact of our 2012 debt refinancing.","At the end of the quarter, we had $151 million of net debt, down about $460 million from year end.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1% and 31.5% for the 6-month period. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate approaching 32%.","We expect cash contributions to our pension plans to approximate $600 million for 2013 with over 1\/2 of that to be contributed in the third quarter.","Erin, that concludes my remarks.","Erin Linnihan","Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Lacey, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about Gulfstream and the outlook for the demand, particularly in the mid-range area and what you are seeing both domestically here from a demand perspective, as well as internationally?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Sure. Interestingly, our book-to-bill was the same this quarter as the year ago quarter, and Gulfstream booked orders for each of our aircraft in the quarter. 80% of our large-cabin orders were for 450 and 550 models. So if you think about the half, about 50% of our orders on large cabin were 450 and 550. We also increased sales of our small to mid-cabin aircraft over the first quarter. And overall, in the half, orders increased 30% -- 37% [ph] from a year ago. The U.S. market, by the way, led this order increase. And I'd say, in general, our order book is holding up very well. I like where we are in our geographical distribution. I like having some balance as a way to manage risks and mitigate overexposure to one market. So we're -- our funnel is robust and we are turning interest into orders.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question on the Aerospace margins and the impact you outlined in your prepared remarks. Can you help us understand, one, just kind of the magnitude of how this is going to impact the margin rates in Q3 just in, I guess, general terms. And then two, help -- give us some color on why it is that we have renegotiations that are taking the prices up with suppliers on programs that otherwise I would think are pretty mature. It would seem somewhat odd to be negotiating prices up on really mature platforms.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, this seems to be an issue or a question that many of you have. But the fact of the matter is that on the 450, 550, we have renegotiated a series of contracts. And in some instances, we are paying higher prices as material costs go up and labor goes up. So we need to offset that through performance. I think that, that's basically just the law of economics as we think about our supplier base. I will tell you that this is not a onetime payment, that the increase will last the life of the contract. So as a result, we do expect margin compression in the second half. And it will be partially offset as we -- in fact, wholly offset as we move forward and move down our learning curve, also on both the 450, 550 and 650 and 280. I will tell you that the first quarter -- the first half performance in productivity in Aerospace was just superb and well above our expectations. I did give you some granularity on what's happening with respect to the increases in supplier contracts from 450s and 550s. We do plan just because of the vagaries in production to produce 2 fewer aircraft, large-cabin aircraft, in the third quarter and we're going to grow our green aircraft deliveries in the third quarter for the mid-cabin, which is going to cause a mild mix shift. So as we come down our learning curve from 650, 280, that pickup will offset in part the higher supplier costs on legacy cabin models. So while some of you may find it difficult to understand why it is that we have increasing prices, I will tell you that, that's often the case despite the maturity of the program. Costs do increase.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So is it safe to say that the margin rates we saw in Q1 and Q2 are both unattainable in either of the quarters in the back half?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, I don't think we're going to -- we are not going to see those margins for the same reasons I explained as we get the impact of some of these other changes. All wholesome, by the way.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Phebe, I'm interested in -- on the G650. Given the strength you're seeing with Gulfstream right now, how do you look at the production trajectory for that? Do you see a place soon where you would start to take rate up to meet demand?","Phebe N. Novakovic","As you know, we plan our production every year at the beginning of the year, late in the fourth quarter. And for '13, our production rate is set. We will look at our '14 production rate later this year. I will give you a little bit of color on the 650. We look at our learning curves in productivity on each one of our airplanes every quarter. And we had a significant improvement in green, and most importantly, completions margin in the second quarter on 650 as Gulfstream worked through that disequilibrium I talked to you about before between initial and final phase production more quickly than we had anticipated. And if you think about it, as a result of working through that disequilibrium faster than we thought, we saw a step function improvement in our learning that's just not normal learning. As we move forward, we won't see that kind of learning on a steady-state basis. So I hope that gives you see some additional color.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But one thing I wondered is, in the past, we've heard that you're sold out for roughly 5 years on the G650, which seem to imply at least some sort of a rate plan farther into the future. I just wondered, given what you see in demand out there, if you're feeling the pressure to try and take that up if you can handle it from an operational standpoint?","Phebe N. Novakovic","We will set our production rate based on our supply base, what we believe that we can produce effectively and the needs of our customers. And that's all I'm going to say. For the remainder of this year, it's set. And we'll give you at the end of this year or I guess the beginning of next year, we'll give you some color on '14, okay?","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A question about CS. The revenue dropped off. It was quite substantial and I think that probably steeper than we had anticipated. Was there anything in the quarter that maybe didn't play out as you anticipated in terms of volume? And then related question, you announced a rather large order from Germany for the EAGLEs. Can you help us size that contract, maybe talk about how those vehicles are going to deliver?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, let me explain our -- when I spoke to you on the fourth quarter call, my projections about revenue at Combat Systems were based on in anticipation of a series of large international orders that have slipped to the right. I think that I have demonstrated my inability to be an accurate prognosticator of timing on international orders, so I'm not going to walk back into that. But I will tell you with respect to the international orders, the circumstances that existed when we first talked to you about them are still extant today. It's simply a slip to the right. So as I think about Combat, clearly their first half is affected by the lack of these orders and there are multiple orders slipping to the right and we have anticipated that they will come in, in the latter half of the year. But as you would expect, the later they come in, the more of an impact they'll have on revenue. I would tell you, however, that we do not anticipate any material impact on their earnings -- in Combat Systems' earnings for the year as a result of that slip.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And with respect to the EAGLE contract with Germany?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, so we had a nice win there, but the customer has asked us not to disclose the funding levels, so I don't intend to.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Phebe, could you talk a bit about the margin potential at Gulfstream for the full year? I know you've -- we're given the previous guidance and you kind of haven't updated that other than to say it's going to be down in the second half. But I think the prior guidance was about 15.5%, 15.6%. And likewise, as you look to the EPS guidance for the full year, does that contemplate cash deployment in the second half in terms of share repurchase?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Answer your second question, no, it does not anticipate share repurchases. And with respect to your first question, we are going to release our Q shortly after the call, and you'll get more color on the segment-by-segment guidance. But suffice it to say, we're going to be above in Aerospace about, I would guess, around 100 basis points.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And cash flow for the year, the net income conversion, do you anticipate getting to a full net income conversion this year? And if not, is it a temporal issue that goes back in '14?","Phebe N. Novakovic","We anticipate, given our current plan, a free cash flow of about 90% of net income. And frankly, our cash will be determined by the timing of the large international orders. But I factored those in, in the second half and I'm looking at about 90%, could be higher.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wanted to ask you about Combat Systems and understanding what you just said about prognosticating on international orders. But let's talk about Abrams for a moment. And if you could give us an update on how much longer your U.S. funding lasts and where potential international orders can take that program and how long major potential Middle East orders could sustain it?","Phebe N. Novakovic","So let me give you a little bit on Abrams. We continue to see congressional support, coupled with our international sales, as a bridge to Abrams' modernization. And that's really how you have to think about the tank line, is that we are currently in a bridging scenario where we will bring in international orders and maintain the lowest possible level of individual tank units to keep that line open, hold our industrial base viable and keep the talent in place. So the bottom line is we're almost there to bridging to the future. We talked to -- I believe that the Abrams modernization is now a '16, '17 -- fiscal year '16, '17 event and we're almost there. We just need a little bit of help from Congress and the international orders. I'll tell you something interesting. Congress, for almost 30 years, has been there to support America's Army in times of budgetary stress. And I have to tell you that had they not done so in the past, I kind of shudder to think what the recent hot wars would have been like without the Abrams tank.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Phebe, with the size of this potential order that's out there, very massive, in fact, couldn't you go above the minimum levels?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Clearly, I guess we could, but I'm simply telling you what the strategy is. We want to maintain the minimum levels as our baseline. And then the more volume we get, the better it is for the workforce and the industrial base. And we need to be there for when the U.S. Army needs us again, and they will.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly since it was your old segment, just could you give us color on what happened with the DDG 51 award and how -- I think that went the opposite of the way it might have gone previously?","Phebe N. Novakovic","The lower bid, bidder won 5 ships, Bath won 4 with an option. So as you can imagine, we're very focused on our competitiveness at Bath, our cost structure and our build efficiency. We can -- we intend to continue to improve our performance and drive our costs lower. Because at the end of the day, we need to provide stability for our workforce and the lowest ultimate cost of destroyers to our customers with the highest profit margins in our market and that is all achievable.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So Phebe, in the IS&T segment, which is still your largest segment by sales, I think, seem to be stabilizing quite a bit after a pretty tumultuous period last year, particularly in the second half. Sales have stabilized, margins seem to have stabilized sequentially and you're indicating margins are going to be up a bit in the second half. Also, backlog is stabilized. Take a step back, this used to be a 10%, 11% business for a very long period and now we're down in the 8% range. As things have stabilized, how do you view the opportunities going forward from getting margins back up to double digit?","Phebe N. Novakovic","We are, as you can imagine, restructuring our business. And let me give you -- in order to maintain our profitability and increase our profitability, but let me give you a little bit of color on what's really driving our IS&T at the moment. Our book-to-bill for the group is 1:1, and frankly, this is -- we've had 6 consecutive quarters of greater than 1:1 or close to 1:1 book-to-bill. So it looks pretty stable to me. You also may recall that at the beginning of the year, we reset the plan for IS&T and we're focused on earnings and cash. And I expect to see the benefits of that accrue partially toward the end of this year. And then going forward, we have some margin expansion opportunities across all of our businesses. One of the things that's driving, I think, our market is that the decline in tactical communications seems to be behind us. So we've got the revenues -- we've got revenue that's both stable and sustainable. I would also note that for '13, we have sufficient backlog to support our outlook. So going forward, we are focused on taking costs out of our business, stabilizing our workforce and we're holding our own in a tough -- in fact, we're more than holding our own in a tough environment. But this is a margin improvement story over time.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So structurally, given the mix here, do you still think it's a realistic target ultimately, not talking short term, but ultimately if mix doesn't change from here to get back to that double digit?","Phebe N. Novakovic","It's certainly our objective. One of the things that's constraining us right now is a restructuring that we're doing in our U.K. business. And once we get through that, that'll take some of the headwind away from -- or remove some of the headwind that we're currently facing. That's going to take us through the remainder of the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Phebe, 6 months ago, when you took the CEO role, you set out a fairly firm view on acquisitions. I was wondering if that has changed in any way and whether you see the potential for any acquisitions going forward, particularly if we start to see the defense industry consolidating in this budget environment?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Let me talk to you about that just briefly. I have consistently said that our focus this year is on operations, that I've got nothing and have had no targets on my radar screen and that M&A is not a focus for us this year. That said, if we think conceptually about the future, I think it makes sense to maintain a strong balance sheet with the budget uncertainty we are facing and as you quite rightly point out, we want to have the capability to be opportunistic with a strong balance sheet in an industry that is likely to experience some consolidation. But at the risk of being a broken record, I'm working on our operations and I think that the team's results are obvious. So I think that kind of tells you where we are.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I mean, I guess related to that last question, you certainly have never really run the business with $3.7 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet. So what is the right number in terms of the cash? And if you in fact are able to get to 90% of your net income, that's only going to grow. So at what point does that cause you either step up the buyback or start to think about external growth opportunities?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, again through this year, I've told you and others that we expect to deploy almost all, if not all, of our free cash flow to share repurchase and dividends. Going forward, I've just explained the value proposition, we'll continue to use free cash flow in shareholder-friendly ways and maintain that strong balance sheet to give us flexibility. I just think that's prudent. It's prudent in 2 respects because we believe we can grow this business by being smart in what we acquire, number one. And number two, there's a fair amount of uncertainty. So in a period of uncertainty, you need to keep your powder dry. But that's not where we are this year. And when we get into next year, we'll begin to talk to you about how we see our positioning for next year. But right now, I got nothing on my radar screen and we're really focused on our operations. As you well know, we had some work to do and this team is doing it.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to circle back on Combat. So we've been chasing this Combat down for the last several years, declining faster than the guidance has been. The business is now, you take the last 2 quarters, it's about a $6 billion run rate business from a sales perspective. Just Phebe, thinking about the international pipeline versus what's going on the domestic side, could this -- looking out over the next couple of years, could this drop below a $6 billion a year business in terms of revenues?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Let me be a little quarrelsome with you about the predicate embedded in part of your question. We are not guiding you to revenue. And I think what I've tried to tell you is we've got to manage what we can control and it's not revenue. So our job is to be a good cyclical, particularly in Combat Systems. And that's to drive costs lower than revenue declines, and we're doing that. We will continue to do that. Going forward, we have a sufficiently-- a very large and robust pipeline of international orders. And when they enter into our backlog, it will largely determine what the growth profile on the revenue side is. But we're going to fight our margins and I think that's how you have to think about it.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So help me understand Gulfstream. I mean, you kind of said margin, 16.5%, which implies a pretty big step down in the third quarter. How much is the supplier change? For example, what percent of G450 manufacturing costs do these contracts represent approximately? And does this new contract impact start beginning of the quarter, middle of the quarter and -- so we can get some better understanding of how a big a deal this is.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, I think I've given you all the color I plan to give you on the supplier contract. I told you this is not a onetime payment and I'm not going to parse the margin variances between the supply chain cost increases and our production rate decreases on our large cabin and the increases in our mid-cabin. That's just not something we're going to report on. But we will work our way through that. And what I've tried to do is give you a sense that the first quarter was very, very strong. And we're going to see some margin compression in the third quarter; and fourth quarter, we're going to improve.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So just when you say you're going to be down 2 units in large biz jets, is that versus the 30 you did this quarter or the 28 you did last year?","Phebe N. Novakovic","That is versus the first half.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You'll be down? I thought...","Phebe N. Novakovic","In other words in large-cabin production in the second quarter, we're just -- because of the way our production planning goes, we are producing 2 fewer large cabin and that is another factor impacting the margin in that quarter.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Phebe, I want to go look at this Gulfstream a little different. In the second quarter, you had 29% incremental margins year-over-year and the same sequentially. How much of that, do you think, is due to kind of what you talked about as your onetime step down? So what would be a sustainable kind of incremental margin? And I've got a second one. If you looked at just the 450 and 550 in terms of its book-to-bill in the quarter, was it about 1, similar to the first quarter?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Look, our 450 and 550 orders are very strong. As I told you, that's about 80% of our large-cabin orders and for the half about 50% of our orders. So those 2 lines are holding up very, very well. You asked about the incremental margin. We -- as I explained to you in the fourth quarter call, we had this buildup in working capital of green airplanes that we had to push through the snake, this bubble -- we had to push through the snake of completions. And we devoted an awful lot of resources to fixing that problem. And frankly, we fixed it much faster than we anticipated. Hence, my comment about the step function improvement in margin. I don't think it's prudent to kind of prematurely pinpoint what our gross margins on each -- any of our airplanes are going to be going forward, particularly the 650 it seems to be of great interest, or when they will achieve it. But we'll continue to come down that learning curve, both in the green production and most importantly, from my perspective, in completions. We don't have enough experience yet to know what a running rate, a steady-state running rate is going to look like on completions on 650. But we have made a step function improvement and we're very proud of the Gulfstream team for working through what was a difficult operational challenge.","George Shapiro","But I would think that the incrementals would at least be something north of 20%. They wouldn't maybe be 29%. Is that a fair statement?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Now George, I'm just not going to get into the variances with you. I think at the end of the day -- I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, just take a look at where are -- I've explained the big muscle movements and where our performance has been and where it's likely to go. But Gulfstream is poised to continue to do very well. This is like almost all of our businesses. We continue to learn unit-over-unit. And that's important to maintaining your profitability. That's just operating leverage and I like it.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Question on -- my question really is on Aerospace on the services side. Phebe, could you just give us some more color on what you're seeing in terms of the overall services environment, both kind of North America and also just thinking about the Jet Aviation business, how that is performing and what you're seeing on an international basis there?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, let me take your -- you've got 2 questions just embedded. First, let me talk about services and then I want to give you guys a little bit more detail on Jet. Our service revenue was technically down year-over-year because we sold, as you may recall, several underperforming Jet facilities late last year. But with respect to Jet, their second quarter was better than their first quarter in services and the third quarter so far is also improving. Service activity was particularly strong in the quarter for Gulfstream, which posted its, interestingly, its second highest service revenue quarter in the last 6 quarters and the third quarter looks pretty good, too. That's particularly noteworthy since we had seconded service staff to the completions challenge on the 650. So very, very strong performance. I would also point out that earnings on service increased a bit over the prior year quarter and in the first half over the first half of 2012 on lower volume. So I like where we are. Let me give you a little bit more details on jet because this is a good news story. Jet was profitable in both Q1 and Q2 of this year. And each line of their business was profitable, and we expect it to remain so going forward. And I thought I might give you some detail on Jet's lines of business. Their FBO business is at the high end of this market. Service business, as you well know, is volume driven, but Jet has good margins compared to its competition, particularly for not being an OEM. But the potentially high-margin business is completions where we had struggled for sometime on our operations, particularly in the high value-added wide-body completions market. So we have devoted a lot of our sales activity and orders in completions have picked up, so -- but more to come on Jet. They've turned the corner and they were a nice contributor in both Q1 and Q2 to Aerospace and I anticipate that they will be for the remainder of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On IS&T, it's certainly done well considering the environment. But can you kind of break it down as best you can. You mentioned that tactical products continue to be firm and appear to have bottomed out. So if you -- can you give us some direction on what type of growth you're seeing and kind of outlook for each of the major parts whether it's -- however you wish to break it up, tactical products versus IT services versus ISR just -- so we can understand the 3 major moving parts there.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, so our IT services business is just under 50% of our revenue. And they're seeing some really nice revenue increases, both in their defense businesses, their Fed\/Civ exposure in their commercial markets. Our ISR business is continuing to grow slowly and they had a very good quarter for margins. Our tactical communications business was the one that -- the one line of business that we have that was particularly affected by its exposure to the Army, but as I mentioned that has stabilized, that it can be a very strong margin performer. And as they restructure and embed the U.K. business into their business, they've got some upside. I would tell you though again that the backlog is there in each one of those 3 lines of business to support our outlook for the year.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I want to talk about risk because I think you've been consistently talking about managing it and trying to eliminate it where you can. Sort of 2 questions related to that. One is do you have -- can you talk about any red programs and\/or the process you go about in terms of eliminating them or removing them? And then second, as you sort of think about this plan that you've articulated for restructuring the business, how much of it is just going to be a way of life going forward and how much of it's like there's some big milestones and we've accomplished some things and you can feel satisfied when '13 is over?","Phebe N. Novakovic","I don't think that a high-performing business is ever done trying to improve itself or shoot for additional operational excellence. So I anticipate that we will continue to look for ways that we can improve our profitability, and frankly, provide low-cost products to our customers, which in a declining market revenue environment can be sort of challenging. With respect to any consolidations, we did announce the consolidation of our OTS and ATP businesses. You didn't ask this question, but I think it's important to understand our margin story for the year. We will cover those consolidation costs with realized savings in this year with no material impact. What that does for us is position us nicely going forward for additional margin expansion. Recall that this is a fairly easy business to-- relatively easy business to integrate given that they've got a number of complementary programs, and in several cases, the same customers. So I think that, that made a lot -- that was a logical thing to do as we were going through our operational reviews and we're looking to improve our profitability and service our customer with a -- it was a logical outcome. You talked about -- let me just mention one other thing, too. As I noted several times or alluded to, we did restructure our U.K. business. And I think that was important to ensure that we can continue to meet the needs of or U.K. customer. So we're well on our way to doing that. And of course, all of these restructurings are difficult. You asked a question about risks and I think I've given you, over time, a pretty good sense of how I see the risks overall. But we have no material red programs. We have programs that we'd like to have performed a little bit better, but our business units know what they are. I think the best -- I think that we talked about this on the last call, the best antidote to a budget cut is performance. And I would note that bears eat the sick and the young first. So I am -- we are very focused on maintaining our good execution on each of our programs because without that execution, you become more vulnerable. So I mean, with a $31 billion business and literarily thousands of contracts, they're likely to have a few that aren't performing up to expectations, but there are none that are a red program.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you for joining our call today.

My name is Adrienne, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Erin Linnihan ","Thank you, Adrienne and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter conference call. ","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic","","Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks relatively brief today. I think the numbers are pretty straight forward and largely speak for themselves. Earlier today we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.71 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.3 billion, operating earnings of $871 million and net earnings of $595 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.07 and were ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We were also somewhat better than our previous guidance and ahead of our own expectations. I should point out that the diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $347.2 million for the quarter, $7.4 million shares below the fourth quarter of last year. I\u2019ll ask Jason Aiken to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I complete my remarks. ","Free cash flow for operations was $341 million, approximately 57% of net income. This is typical to the first quarter. But I should add that we expected particularly robust second quarter from a free cash flow perspective driven in part by advance payments on international orders. In many respect the story for the quarter is about the order book, particularly in defense. We ended the quarter with the total backlog of $56 billion, up approximately $10 billion over the last quarter with particularly impressive growth in combat systems backlog. Marine systems backlog grew and IS&T had a modest gain after adjusting for some of the backlog in the UK that was transferred to combat systems. ","Interestingly we have more funded backlog at the end of this quarter than we've had any time in the last three years, the same is true for total backlog. We also look forward to a strong second quarter intake, particularly marine system with the anticipated booking of the Block IV Virginia class multi-year contract, the underpinnings of our defense businesses are clearly solidifying. ","Compared to the first quarter 2013 revenue was down less than expected $80 million or 1.1%. On the other hand operating earnings were up $24 million or 2.8%. Our operating cost and expenses were $104 million less than the year ago quarter leading to a 50 basis point improvement in margins at 11.9%, this is very strong operating leverage. ","Net earnings were up even more than operating earnings, 4.2% versus 2.8% primarily due to lower tax rate. EPS was up 5.6% over the year ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rate and lower share count. ","Let me provide some commentary and a little bit of perspective around the results of our operating segments, first Aerospace. Sales are up over Q1, 2013 by $347 million, 19.5% and essentially flat sequentially. Earnings outpaced the year-ago quarter by $94 million about 30%. Compared to Q4, 2013 operating earnings are up $56 million or 16% principally due to mix shift and continuous improvement on 650 production and completion efficiency. ","This resulted in 19% margin for the group. Again Jet Aviation's continuing profitability made a nice contribution. Orders were not strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2013 order book. We are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group ","Marine systems, revenue was off 1.5%, $25 million compared to the year ago quarter. The sequential story is similar with respect to revenue. However, operating earnings were up $7 million 4.4% against the year ago and the same sequentially. ","The real story in the quarter is a 10.4% margin rate which is really top notch and better than expected. All of the shipyards performed well in the quarter. Backlog grew $837 million in the quarter with significantly more to come in the second quarter, as I mentioned a few minutes ago. ","At Combat Systems, compared to the first quarter of 2013 sales were down $236 million or 15.2% and earnings were down $79 million or 36.7% on a margin of 10.3. It is important to note however that these results were impacted by a $29 million restructuring charge at ELF as a result of reduction in our Austrian operations which were consolidated into Spain and Switzerland. ","If we disregard that charge margins would be 12.5%. Despite the restructuring charge ELF is expected to have operating margins around 10% for the year. The big story here is the large international order that finally came through. Total backlog is up $10.2 billion over the year-end number. Each of the combat systems businesses filled backlog in the quarter. You should see steady revenue, earnings and margin rate performance improvement throughout the year in this group. ","IS&T, The revenue in this business group is holding up well in this difficult environment. You might recall that our guidance to you was to expect a revenue decline of 20% year-over-year but it didn't happen in first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up $166 million or 6.8% against a year ago quarter. It was off 15.2% sequentially. Operating earnings of $183 million in the quarter were only $2 million less than the year ago quarter on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. ","On a sequential basis operating earnings were $13 million lower or 66.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins, once again exhibiting nice operating leverage. Total backlog for the Group was down $43 million from year-end but that includes a $248 million transfer of backlog from our UK business to combat system. Absent that transfer IS&T backlog actually grew. So once again IS&T is off to a good start. And thinking about the rest of the year we are increasing our EPS guidance to $7.05 to $7.10 from our initial expectation of $6.80 to $6.85. The increase assumes currently anticipated operating performance and the share count reduction realized in the first quarter. Think about the quarterly performance is lower in the second, flat in the third quarter with a strong Q4 finish.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken. ","Jason W. Aiken ","Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will take just a few minutes to review some financial items with you before we start the question-and-answer period. Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $23 million in the first quarter of 2013. For 2014 we expect net interest expense to be approximately $90 million. ","At the end of the quarter our balance sheet reflects the net cash position, that\u2019s cash in excess of debt of $385 million, a decrease of $1 billion from the end of 2013. This decrease is due in large part to our activities on the capital deployment front which I will address in just a minute. We don't have any scheduled debt repayment until January of next year when $500 million of fixed rate notes will mature. ","Our effective tax rate of 30.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected, primarily as a result of the close out of the 2012 tax year. For the full year we still expect our effective tax rate to fall between 30.5% and 31%. We expect cash contribution to our pension plan 2014 to be around $550 million to fund our obligation. The bulk of funding is scheduled to occur in second half of the year, specifically during the third quarter. ","As an update to our capital deployment plan I would like to address our activities in the first quarter. As you will recall we entered into an accelerated share repurchase plan in late January to repurchase 11.4 million of our shares. This exhausted our remaining repurchase authorization and in early February our Board authorized repurchase of an additional 20 million shares. Since then we repurchased 3 million more shares during the quarter. In total we deployed approximately $1.7 billion on share repurchases and divided payments in the quarter. ","In March our Board declared a dividend increase of more than 10%, that's the 17th consecutive annual increase. Our intent in 2014 is to return essentially all of our free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter we have $4.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well positioned to execute our capital deployment strategy during the coming quarters and achieve the objective of [inaudible] 2014. ","Erin, that concludes my remarks. I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A. ","Erin Linnihan","","Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Adrienne, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi Group. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Good morning. Just a quick question on Gulfstream. You mentioned the bookings there being down quarter-on-quarter after a really nice finish to last year. I am just wondering if you can remind us of the seasonality that we typically should expect with bookings at Gulfstream just to kind of help everybody get prepared for the rest of the year kind of based on what you see in your pipeline at this point. What do bookings look like on a quarter-to-quarter basis throughout the rest of the year?","Phebe N. Novakovic","So the new aircraft sales opportunities continue to look very good and we got strong customer interest but we are still seeing extended negotiation periods in order to get that order closed and what that drives is some difficulty in being very specific and precise about the quarterly progression. So our orders have intended to be a little lumpier like in the first quarter building with a strong fourth quarter finish. That\u2019s the pattern that we have been looking at for a while and this year looks about the same with no material difference. But the order interest, the activity is very-very strong. It\u2019s just when we get to closure and that\u2019s what makes it difficult for us to be real clear and specific on quarter timing.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","And the mix that you are seeing at this point, is it still favoring the large cabins versus the mid cabins?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. We talk the last couple of call about understanding our mix and our order activity and when you have got a four year backlog on the 650s, you are not likely to see and in fact it's somewhat impossible to get a one-to-one book-to-bill. So what we follow very carefully is the order activity and sign-ups for large cabin, mature aircraft, 450 and 550 and 60% of the orders in the quarter were for those two models. So again, very, very strong for the 450 and 550.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Phebe, I have just a follow-up on that. I was wondering if you could comment on the sort of pricing. You are saying in the new and used jet market and also if you have seen any impact from the recent activity over in Ukraine and Russia?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. So, pricing is holding up nicely in the pre-owned market and looks to be stabilizing in the large cabin market, particularly on the 550. In the mid-cabin, we see a little bit more pricing pressure but that is nothing new. This is consistent with what we have seen in the past. And so far the activities in Ukraine and Russia have not affected our operations. Our Moscow operations are continuing and Gulfstream hasn't seen any material activity.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","Thanks. Good morning, good quarter. Phebe, if I could go through one-by-one but may be the segments and your outlooks have been revised, much particularly on the margin if you want to extricate the kind of the margin guidance you are looking for as well as aero guidance for margins and maybe IS&T sales?","Phebe N. Novakovic","","Yes. So we didn't give specific update for the segment guidance and we are holding to it at the moment. We will update it in the second quarter when we've got more clarity about where exactly the puts and takes are across the business, but we are confident enough to increase our overall guidance. So we are very comfortable with that. With respect -- and I will just tell you, with respect to combat in particular we are still holding to our low to mid 14% range in aerospace we are still looking at the 17% margin range. So nothing has changed and we are very confident in both of those numbers.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And the upper IS&T sales?","Phebe N. Novakovic","IS&T sales were stronger in first quarter then we had anticipated and we have good order activity. But again, IS&T sales are pretty lumpy, driven in large measure by our healthcare business, which is highly seasonal and we usually only get about a quarter advance notice when it comes to the customers interest and increasing the sales volume.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay, good luck. Good quarter. Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic","","Thanks.","Operator","","Next question come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phebe N. Novakovic","","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan","","Thanks. Good morning Phebe. Just wanted to dig into the aerospace margin a little bit. I hear you on maintaining the guidance for now since it's early but you beat December by a couple of basis points, last year obviously Q1 was a very strong start. May be if you could give us a couple of reasons why we shouldn't get too far in front of you on aerospace margin side.","Phebe N. Novakovic","","Let me talk a little bit about margins in quarter versus our budget and they are attributable to two primary factors, lower than anticipated pre-owned sales and better than expected G650 cost performance. So going forward we don't see that margin performance repeating for a whole host of reasons mix shift, supplier cost, timing of other expenses. So when we factor all of those into our thinking at the moment we don\u2019t see that kind of upside to margins over our guidance. ","Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America","Good morning, Phebe.","Phebe N. Novakovic ","Hi. Ron.","Ronald Epstein- Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Big picture question for you. If you stand back and observe the operating profit of the company in the quarter, nearly about 46% of it was from [inaudible]. So General Dynamics now looks like it\u2019s almost a half a commercial aerospace company and half a defense contractor. How do you think about that strategically about the positioning of the company? And when you think about deploying capital and that sort of mix?","Phebe N. Novakovic","So we like our strategic positioning. I like that balance between aerospace and defense, and that our defense business is as I pointed out and we\u2019ve seen now quarter-over-quarter through the last year are holding up very, very nicely. With implicit growth in the marine group, which we don\u2019t talk of a whole lot about, it doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention but in addition to block IV we\u2019ve got considerable suitable revenue upside for the next several years as we move increasingly into a higher replacement and we gear up even more on the two year of Virginia class construction. So there is some upside in our first of our current sort of sales profile on the defense side driven primarily by marine group but not exclusively. So stabilized combat and IS&T is continuing to hold the trend. ","So I like where we are with respect to our balance between our commercial aerospace and business jet market and defense. When you think about capital deployment I think clearly we need to -- we will and we do make investments where we believe we are likely to get a good return and you will see over the last, frankly almost decade now, we\u2019ve been heavily investing in Gulfstream and that investment is beginning to pay-off with very purposeful our capital deployment strategy at Gulfstream, because we believe and history has proven us correct that it was a business jet market and our place in that market was a good market to invest in. ","So I think that the rectitude of that, the series of positions many years ago that we're continuing to follow makes it an awful lot of sense. So I think going forward you can expect the same kind of behavior for us so we see an opportunity to grow very accretively and profitably we will.","Ronald Epstein- Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thank you, good morning. I am interested in the Minsheng order which was just announced. And I think it\u2019s a very interesting situation but I am trying to understand the majority of the airplanes in your previous, the 2011 order those have still not been delivered. And I am curious what your expectations are regarding the timing of the deliveries in this very large order in the next several years. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","","So I think the underlying assumptions in your -- in the beginning of your questions on Minsheng we have delivered a number of those airplanes. Going forward we have conservatively booked that order, the order was for 60 aircraft and another 20 options and we were very conservative in our bookings of those firm orders. So as we go forward and we like -- that\u2019s a terrific business for us Minsheng is a close partner. We have a very good relationship with them and we see that as steady. It will come in episodic orders, speed orders but so far we like where we are.","Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co","I am assuming that this is something. This is really a long term situation that\u2019s very tied to what happens in China in terms of demand, is that fair?","Phebe N. Novakovic","","Yes, it is fair. But we have a history with Minsheng that when they place an order they mean it. And when we declare it when we move it from estimated potential contract value in to firm orders we have got a lot of deposits and we have a slot and a delivery profile. So, so, that's again we are -- this isn't a big pop with no substance. When we announced these orders with Minsheng the full intension is to execute and with -- you know our commercial exposure right, it's going to be driven by macroeconomic factors but so far there's considerable demand for these airplanes in China.","Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","","Yes, good morning and nice quarter Phebe. Phebe, can I just ask kind of a back to kind of Ron's question, more of a big picture now that the budgets out the green book out, could you maybe give us a little, how do you think GD is positioned domestically here both combat and marine on some of those core programs? You touched upon it on the Virginia-class and the Ohio class replacement but maybe just how you are thinking about given the DoD outlook.","Phebe N. Novakovic","So a couple of things. Absent a significant change in the threat environment, or a return to the sort of self-destructive government behavior across the board spending type, we believe that we have crossed at least in our programs and I would point you to the strong backlog as a harbinger of our sales performance. The majority of our programs are programs of record and as we talked before they tend to fare better in a funding constrained environment. So combat, combat's going forward profile is, is heavily dependent and tied to international orders. We have seen those orders begin to come in. There are more out there in our pipeline, frankly fairly robust. The investments spending on both army and the marine core is at sustainment levels and we factored back into our plan and we are comfortable with that those programs that we have on our plan are executable and that the funding is available. ","And to marine I touched on the two big drivers of Ohio replacement and the Virginia-class through the year. We also see continued interest in commercial containership and tanker market. So those again, those orders for the commercial during that ship building tend to be a little bit more of the products but we still have a healthy pipeline that we are continuing to explore with our customers. So if I step back in IS&T, IS&T has again largely we believe stabilized itself. It's a growth engine there being GVIT, not surprisingly. Our ISR business is stable with long standing programs of record. And our networking and communication business has downsized itself in response to the revenue decline and again has programs of record that they are continuing to execute on. ","So across the board I think that we are on the defense side very well positioned. Again I point you to our backlog. ","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","","Good morning. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","Hi, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. I wanted to see if you can talk a little bit more about combat systems and I am just trying to understand a couple of things. One is you know an order of magnitude in terms of the advances benefit you expect to get in Q2. And then trying to just think about how do you go from a 10% margin now to a 14% margin for the year. You mentioned the EOS restructuring charge even if you take that out, you still have to have some high teens type of margins and I am not sure what drives that.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Sure. So let me talk a little bit more about the Q1 margins. I mentioned our $29 million charge. We also have some contract mix, changes across the group that will normalize as we go through the year quarter-over-quarter. And you will recall that we moved the specialty vehicle to UK Vehicle program out of the backlog in IS&T and in to combat and that is a conservatively booked program given the state that it was in at the beginning of 2013. ","So those were some of the margin pressures we saw in the first quarter. With respect to going forward I think that this group has amply demonstrated their ability to reduce costs faster than revenues declined. So we've seen quite a bit of operating leverage from them. As you think about Combat Systems at the height of their revenue and in 2009 kind of crowding 10 billion we've seen a 40% decline in margins and yet last year we had -- in revenue last year we had 15% margins and this year we are looking at 14% and I don't see anything in our backlog or in our performance year-to-date that would suggest that we're going to have headwinds on margins.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And any sense in terms of the advanced benefit you mentioned in the second quarter? ","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes so it's going to be in excess of $1 billion and but again much of that will be deployed quickly obviously to our subcontractors. ","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","Good morning Phebe and Jason. Quick question Phebe about your comment on the 650. You noted you had better cost performance there in the quarter, I wondered if you might give us some color on whether that was recurring or non-recurring in nature. How should we think about the implications there for the learning curve relative to your prior comment? ","Phebe N. Novakovic","So we are continuing to come down that learning curve. And our 650 margin performance on both the green airplanes and outfitted the airplanes is improving quarter-over-quarter. So very nice operating performance on the 650, and we expect that to continue. Certainly we're going to -- the learning curve will flatten out as we go forward but so far we expect to see additional margin improvement on both green and outfitted airplane.","Phebe N. Novakovic","But there wasn't anything in the quarter, specifically that the benefit is\u2026","Phebe N. Novakovic","These are repeatable. ","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","Okay, thank you. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","Margins are repeatable. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Phebe, if we could just dig into IS&T a little bit more obviously you did outperform the expectations and the guidance here in the quarter. How much of that is -- it sounds like you think that's potentially sustainable or is it just the army pressure is somewhat delayed and may be not even fully a 2014 event and I guess I am speaking more to the C4 side. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","So C4 saw the largest decline in the quarter in-line with our plan and as you'll recall we talked quite a bit at the end of last year and beginning of this year about our attempt to de-risk our army exposures C4 has done that. So what we see right now going forward to C4 is they've got almost everything in all their revenue in their backlog. ","So I think that they can see some stability from a revenue perspective based on our expectations going forward. And again their programs of records particularly when TR are really doing quite nicely. Each one of those businesses had a book-to-bill of 0.9 or greater. So that also tells me that there is support for our products. So they've got C4 so let's recall has exposure to the UK and Canada and fairly robust exposure in both markets.","So that helped offset some of the uncertainty we've had in the past about army spending. ","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So the 33% reduction in sales you talked about in January, is that off the table or you're simply saying you are observing it well enough with strength elsewhere?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yeah, I thought I gave you around a 20% decline.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Well 20% overall for the unit, right?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yeah. It too soon for us to walk back from that decline. We had a good first quarter, a good book to bill but I don't want to get out ahead of that because as I mentioned earlier one of the big drivers is that the largest driver in IS&T revenue is going to be our healthcare business and that is very, very seasonal and we usually -- what our experience has been over the last year and half we only get a quarter worth of notice, the warning that we are going to have to up our activity. ","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Right. Well maybe another way to ask the same question is was the President\u2019s budget with the drawdown in army down to the mid-400,000 level, is that already contemplated in your guidance, does that match up with what you are planning for?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yeah.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic","No surprises there and no reason to adjust. ","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Right, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company","","Yes, thanks so much, Phebe. So if we can maybe get a little more color to help us reconcile the downtick in margins at Gulfstream from 19% to like 17% plus, 17.6% for the year. I mean if in fact you are doing well on G650 with more learning curve improvement to come I would think that would be in margin plus as we move forward and you also have mentioned used biz jet sales being weak, I mean is there higher, I mean I assume they are not hugely -- the volume looked so good in that quarter. I still have a little trouble understanding how you know your guide for the year isn't quite a bit low. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","So the pre-armed and let me give you a little bit more color on this. The pre-armed sales activity was lower in the quarter that we had anticipated but we still expect to take pre-armed and remainder of the year that obviously has margin headwind. We also going to have some mix shift that we are anticipating. Timing and other expenses and we thought supplier cost that we are factoring into our thinking. So it is 650 performance continues to be good but as we go out to produce more mid cabins we are going to see those are lower margins particularly on both of those 280 and the 150 and that provides you know that causes some headwind in margin activity. ","So it\u2019s really the big shift, supplier cost and timing that make us properly cautious about the margin expectations for the year.","Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company","Okay but it looks like you know your guide, as I take it of large cabin deliveries you did 25 and aren't we looking for something like 118 for the year and so well yes we do have an uptick coming in terms of the mid-size. You know you also have on the larger planes in the mid-size you know are considerably less revenue. So I guess I am still is it something at jet or services, you know that is changing the mix because I think you explained just on the surface the mix doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s that much worse. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","You know the 450 is a lower margin airplane than the 550, in fact 650 margins have now exceeded the 450 margins largely because of the supplier cost that we talked about before and those increases in supplier cost hit the 450 pretty robustly. So the service activity we anticipate continued a good strong level of service activity. It\u2019s very, very strong in the quarter and going forward jet continues to be profitable. ","So I really go back to mix our shift on 450\u2019s and mid-cabins and higher pre-owned, our supplier cost and then the timing of some other expenses. So it really is premature from us to get out there and project -- I don\u2019t see at it at the moment, 19% or 18% margins doesn\u2019t mean we also\u2026.","Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company","So your information is basically that within the large cabin the mix is shifting pretty sharply toward the 450 which is the lower margin product?","Phebe N. Novakovic","That\u2019s right. Well not pretty sharply but it is shifting. And those margins have been compressed for the reasons we\u2026","Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company"," ","Okay. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Good morning, Phebe?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Hi, David.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Want to ask you about the balance sheet, even with the big quarter in terms of share repo you sit on net cash position I know you committed to returning 100% of free cash flow this year but would still be in a net cash position. So can you just talk about thoughts from the balance sheet any kind of leverage levels you are thinking about just utilizing looking to utilize balance sheet little bit more? Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Let me give you sort of overarching view and then I\u2019ll let Jason give you some more color. But we used our balance sheet when we believe that there's an appropriate opportunity to make accretive investments. We have sufficient cash flow for this year to support the kind of share repurchases and dividends that we anticipate. So I frankly like where we are, and we like our credit rating we want to retain it. We don\u2019t see any reason to leverage the balance sheet to get a quick path in share repurchases that aren\u2019t necessarily repeatable in the next year. And this is too much of your future flexibility, not what we want to be.","Jason W. Aiken","Yeah and just to add to that maybe in the quarter you saw that we did essentially \"use the balance sheet to the tune of a billion dollars\" that was really the effect of the ASR and fulfilling the commitments that we made last year which earned free cash flow to shareholders. So that was in effect our use of the balance sheet for this year and it really articulated both the plans just want to get efficient free cash flow forecasted and find that try to return that to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. ","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Good morning. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","Hi George.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Phebe since you are not changing any guidance at this point on the sectors is it fair to assume that the increase in your EPS is coming primarily from the share buybacks because you historically don\u2019t ever factor that into your guidance?","Phebe N. Novakovic","","It comes from three things. The maintaining or at least anticipating the EPS-based on our current share count. We see operating improvements that are driving about half of our current increase in our estimates on EPS. And but that we are not in a position to parse that, those operating improvements with any details among the four units. That\u2019s why I think I am far more comfortable in giving you that kind of color on the second quarter when we\u2019ve got more clarity about where we\u2019ve been through the half of the year and how the rest of the year shapes up.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay and one follow-up. The 650 it's been lots of discussion in the paper is it used planes are commanding like a $10 million premium to what you are selling them for. I mean what\u2019s your plan as far as increasing the rate on that 650?","Phebe N. Novakovic","You mean the -- what you mean the production rate?","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Increase in your production rate given that demand seems to be so strong.","Phebe N. Novakovic","So we want to as you know our past behavior will influence us going forward. We raise our production rates when we are confident that we can execute efficiently, green deliveries and profitable, green deliveries and outfitting. You will recall on the 650 we spent a majority of last year working through the -- what we call the dis-equilibrium on the retrofit. So that's -- we're mindful that we had a pretty detailed plan that we effectively put behind us. But it seems to me a bit -- I guess imprudent to get up there and begun to pump up the production rate until we have got more experience on a quarter-by-quarter basis on both the green deliveries and outfitting.","So we are properly balanced at the moment. We will consider increases in rates. We do that at the end of every year and then that's how we set our guidance for you in the following year.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Hi.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","Phebe, I think last year you might have termed 2013 as a back-to-basics year.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","And so, what's 2014 going to be about?","Phebe N. Novakovic","","More back-to-basics. I don't think you can ever get away from absolute requirement to improve your operating performance quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. You never got enough, you're never done. So that is going to be a strategic focus and tactical execution of this management team going forward. In addition we are -- I think that's been clear from our behavior heretofore in the year that we anticipate the deployment of all if -- most if not all of our free cash flow in dividend and share repurchases. ","So that's something we were not able to accomplish last year that we will. So increased focus on the shareholder friendly cash deployment and more blocking and tackling on operation, return in invested capital, expanding margin and managing for cash. It's just never done.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","Just a follow-up on that and I agree that makes a lot of sense, but somewhere in here, you need to make that there is the right investment for the future of each of the businesses. So you don't want to harvest too much to, and you clearly talk about whether it -- ships or Ohio class or this new opportunity internationally. But could you be -- could you give us a couple of other examples where in the couple of other business units where you are seeing new product that also going to provide some of this basic or organic growth?","Phebe N. Novakovic","","Yes. So you quite rightly pointed out that in the marine group we have organic growth potential and therefore as you would expect we have invested in the marine group, largely in infrastructure and capital structure since those are capital intensive businesses. In combat, what we have really our raise on that the last year and for this year as well is to size that business accordingly. But we make investments as we go along in those lines of business where we see a profitable return. So I think you can see that and our expectations on ELS. ","We have invested by fairly significant investments in restructuring, why to make that business more competitive and we're beginning to see fruits of that labor. That's also true in the UK. You have had significant restructuring charges in the UK to make us more competitive, and position ourselves for again organic growth and that's in the IS&T business. Our Intel and ISR business, we continue to invest in appropriate with the returns we expect in the market. Our IT Services business is a low investment business by definition. So I don't really see an organic requirement to invest in the IS&T business in C4. We invest appropriately Canada and the UK and right size the business in the United States with the demand. ","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","Thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Godyn, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","","Hey thank you for taking my question. We heard a lot of questions on the Aerospace segment but I wanted to ask one more. Phebe last quarter you mentioned that there would be a dramatic rise in fourth quarter margins as you thought about the cadence throughout the year. Just given with the performance in the first quarter and what we've heard about your guidance for the full year, I am not sure if that is still valid. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","I think I will anticipate where you are headed in this quarter. We pulled some of the margin performance into the first quarter so I expect the fourth quarter to be lighter than the first quarter. That is different than we anticipated when we gave the guidance which was light in the first quarter and then building with the strong fourth quarter. We still expect a strong fourth quarter but not at the same level for all the reasons that we've articulated this morning. ","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","And perhaps the more important kind of takeaway from this is I think that had given some investors confidence that as we thought about 2015, the exit rate was robust and we would be set up for continued margin expansion in Aerospace. Is that framework still right? ","[Technical Difficulty]","Phebe N. Novakovic","Do we still have an analyst with a question? ","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hi, this is John can you hear me? ","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes it's a good thing our communications products are more reliable than this thing, who knows what happened. ","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Glad to have you back. What I had asked was I think the comment about fourth quarter seeing a ramp has given some confidence on continued margin expansion in aerospace in 2015. Is that still the right framework to use today with the new guidance?","Phebe N. Novakovic","So I think as we think about 2015 it's obviously too soon to tell and we'll -- there are lot of factors that will emerge during the course of the year that will influence and inform our margin guidance but we anticipate that aerospace will continue to have very strong margin performance, both at Gulfstream, both this year and but equally important in \u201915 at Gulfstream as the 650 continues to come down its learning curve, and also at Jet Aviation which is increasingly profitable. So nice performance at jet and they are positioned to increase their order book. They solved their operating challenges and so I expect more upside margin ignition from jet. ","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Just thoughts about the future.","Erin Linnihan","Adrienne, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","","The next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton","","Yes, good morning. I just want to ask one on Marine and maybe a follow-up. Phebe It looks like marine repair that business has been a real great growth driver for you over the last four or five years. I know you got done some deals there. But I am just wondering you know with the navy fleet staying at a pretty low level and being kind of tasked increasingly around the world. Is repair kind of an ongoing growth story for you from that perspective?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yeah, so you know I think somebody asked that question earlier about investments. Kind of this was the place where we made an investment, I was EDP at the marine group and I felt very strongly at the time that we needed to expand our repair footprint and we did that, so that we are now bi-coastal. In fact we are heavily represented in four of the five maybe home ports and we did that purposely with the expectation that as the fleet ages repair workflow increase. I frankly like repair work in general. It\u2019s steady, it\u2019s fairly predictable performance and very predictable performance if you know what you are doing and we do. So it\u2019s been a nice on the surface side, it\u2019s been a nice growth engine for us. We also just recently won up in the Pacific North West a very large repair contract for CVM. So that again expands our footprint b-coastally. ","On the submarine side, submarine repair work tends to come from two sources, one excess workflow from the public yards and second emerging demand that as the fleet experiences issues well under sea, so in both of those instances we have seen fairly lumpy but when we get it pretty profitable submarine repair work.","Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton","Got it.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Your assumption is quite correct that we have liked those investments, the return on those investments that we made in surface repair business.","Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton","Got it, thank you. And just one follow up on marine, I am just wondering as you ramp in commercial volumes you guys won a lot of orders there, if there\u2019s going to be any negative impact to marine margin and then a similar issue on marine margin, similar question about this recent Virginia sub marine pay load marginal issue, if that would be any impact to margin rate. ","Phebe N. Novakovic","So for very high performing shipyards, which our three shipyards are, margins change quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year almost entirely based on mix. So you would expect that when we get increase we get a new order we are going to see some margin compression, as we come down our learning curve you will see margins expand. That\u2019s true on both the Naval, ship building side as well as the commercial ship building side. So NASSCO had very, very good margin performance on both its navy and commercial ship building work revenue, largely driven by just performance improvement quarter-over-quarter, day-after-day. The pay load issue we don't anticipate any margin compression on the issue that has come up with the North Dakota. We discovered that in concert with our navy customer and are addressing their requirements to do a complete inspection. So no real I mean it was a surprise and unfortunate. But we are [nearly set back] with our flow under control and it's frankly it's a supplier issue and we will address that. ","Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton","Got it, very helpful, thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operation Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Erin, please go ahead.","Erin Linnihan","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filing.","I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks somewhat brief, since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data up-front and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective.","The first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you.","The diluted weighted average share count was $312.3 million for the quarter, compared to consensus of about $315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the out-performance. I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the out-performance came from strong operating results, as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of 65 million, we had $374 million of free cash flow from operations.","The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter 2015, revenue was down $60 million, less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million, or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on a strange of a 40-basis point improvement in margins.","On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%. but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of positive operating leverage.","Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year ago quarter, as a result of better operation earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate.","So let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million, compared to Q1, 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million sequentially against a strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6% on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin. Operating earnings were up a million sequentially on 150 basis point improvement operating margin.","Orders to the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders of 1.3 billion were 1.3 billion and the dollar book base book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw on the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015. The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last five years, including 2016, is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5.","So it was a quarter were the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We had previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins, and flat operating earnings for the year. We still believe we will be at flat operating earnings for the year, but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher margins. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries in the next year and still come out in the same place.","Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year ago quarter, and up $149 million or 7.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year ago quarter, and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion Ohio replacement program which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for about 80% of the construction of new subs.","The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe, and we find that very wholesome.","Some of the more interesting comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing, but earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013, in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 and operating earnings were down only $17 million on 160 basis point improvement in margins. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite wholesome.","Also in the quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low rate production on two large international orders for Canada, the mid-east, and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow through the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill, all in all, extremely strong operating performance at Combat Systems.","With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against a year ago quarter, and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter were $31 million more than the year ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million, or 7.8%, and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction.","I think it's important to note that IS and T backlog was $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was $1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last three years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast cycle businesses.","So we are off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for many years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice is to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.","Jason Aiken","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. About a year ago we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact that foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within Combat Systems. Remember we're referring to the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm to our contracts. This continues to be a factor in 2016, and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year ago period, our revenues in the Combat segment would have declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year.","Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year.","Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over a billion dollars on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than three times our free cash flow from operations, and we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so.","At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year.","Erin that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan","Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.","Liz [ph], could you remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason M. Gursky with Citi.","Jason Gursky","Hey. Good morning, Phebe.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Gursky","I was wondering if you could drive a little bit - good morning. I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on the Aerospace business that you talked about, a revenue slip or a push out or maybe it was something that was driven on your own volition, but some sort of slip into next year on the revenue side. I'm wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on that. And then also just talk about the sustainability of the margins that we saw this quarter. Obviously continued to see some expansion there. Just wondering whether these are any kind of one time kinds of things or whether we're setting a new bar here for margins? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","So let me talk a little bit about revenue and give you some insight into how we think about revenue and how we develop it with respect to Aerospace. We take revenue directly from the operating plan, and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors, as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed deliveries, service volume and mix, which by the way can and do move across reporting periods. Pre-owned Jet Aviation Services and completion. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, I think it's a pretty good one. Our plan has us selling between 10 to 14 pre-owned airplanes with revenue of $250 million at break-even margins. It's very difficult to forecast this.","This quarter had one sale for $4 million, a good thing, but below our revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane greens and completion deliveries because of the backlog of the 650. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4 but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year, and that's what we think is feasible.","Jason Gursky","And are the sustainability of the margins going-forward?","Phebe Novakovic","We're sticking with, you know, we're going to have slightly higher margins, as I said, because we're going to keep our earnings flat, and we're going to have","slightly less revenue. So I think the margin you're going to see, as I noted some improvement, from what I guided you to which was about 19%.","Jason Gursky","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Ronald Epstein","Hey. Good morning, Phebe.","Phebe Novakovic","Hey, Ron.","Ronald Epstein","So I think probably no big surprise, sort of the question that everybody's, you know, kind of thinking about is, what demand are you seeing on 650? How is that going? I mean, it's - I think it's no secret there's been some more 650's piling up in the available for sale market. Can you just give everybody your perspective on what's going on there? And how healthy that market is, or not. Just some color on that?","Phebe Novakovic","Sure. Be happy to. So what I want to do is give you some facts instead of speculation. Think about it as firsthand intelligence, not second and third hand conjecture. So let me parse this in some specificity. First, sales activity, as I noted, in the quarter is","similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter, and orders this quarter were as anticipated, seasonably light. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarter seemed to slow down some purchasing decisions, but our pipeline remains active.","Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large cabin planes by others. So think about it this way. No change on that front.","Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations, and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year, and the first available ELS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall, but the 650 has 100% market share for a market it created, and from my perspective would appear to, I think it's safe to assume, or what I see, is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plane and our demand is solid. The number of pre-owned 650's apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale to pre-owned aircraft. So I've tried to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield. And give you the facts by - by the, you know, the large cabin airplanes that we sell.","Ronald Epstein","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Maybe just to follow-up on Ron's question may be slightly more broadly. What you're seeing out there on the Aerospace side in terms of regional variances, but I don't think has changed in the first quarter this year, and also more broadly, on the pricing of your product?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, orders in the first quarter were 50% U.S., 30% Mid-Eastern Europe and 21% Asia Pacific, that goes everywhere from, and our region there is from Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, into China. Frankly, not a whole lot of quarterly variance on the - where the orders are emanating from. Pricing, we have, as we noted, adjusted our prices for the 450, 550 commensurate with where they are in their life cycle. We have not, and do not, intend to adjust for 650 prices.","Robert Stallard","And any change on the G280 there?","Phebe Novakovic","No, it's about the same.","Robert Stallard","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter J. Arment with Stern Agee CRT.","Peter Arment","This quarter. Phebe, could you give us an update on kind of where things are on the G500 and G600 program? I saw the announcement earlier this month on kind of the progress but, you know, kind of how you view those programs transitioning into 2017 and 2018?","Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Sure. Both airplanes, the G500 and the G600 are moving nicely through their test program. There have been no negative surprises. And as I think you alluded to, you read that we recently joined the wing to the fuselage and on the G600 we expect to fly later this year or early 2017. From the sales perspective, the customer interest in both airplanes has been good and, you know, and as we progress through the development program, we expect the demand to increase.","Bye the way, to - for those of you who like to speculate about Gulfstream future models. I wanted to assure you that there is no 600ER. We'll be able to publish a definitive range for that plane once we're in test flight, and we have a reputation for exceeding our target, but the G600 is the G600.","Erin Linnihan","I think we can take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Co.","Cai Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. Good numbers, Phebe.","Phebe Novakovic","Thank you.","Cai Rumohr","Could you comment on two things, you know, why was your profitability quite so good this quarter, and particularly where was R&D? And secondly, you mentioned a couple of deliveries slipping from this year into next year. How many slipped? And why did they slip? Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","So, you know, profitability and you're focus on cost is a quarter-by-quarter battle. At Gulfstream, we had a couple of things. Favorable mix, improved labor efficiency, very nice high margins at service at Gulfstream, both from the mix of service in the barn and performance. We also had substantial improvement in G&A expense, even though R&D went up slightly.","You know, we're benefiting from all of the cost cutting we've been doing. We've been improving our processes, reducing waste and we're also getting some benefit from lower material costs. So the cost initiatives began in 2015 to reduce overhead and indirect throughout the enterprise are paying off.","Cai Rumohr","And the slips in deliveries?","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah, so the slips in delivery. We, every year, every quarter, working with our customers, can determine whether it's more convenient or preferable to take one, two, three airplanes in a given quarter, in a given year. It's not unusual for us to move airplanes across reporting periods or across years even. So we typically haven't talked about it before, but I wanted to give you guys a little bit more understanding of a revenue number.","Cai Rumohr","Thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel Pearlstein","Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Sam.","Samuel Pearlstein","Just to ask something other than Gulfstream. Can you talk a little bit about the Ohio replacement? And I guess what I'm trying to just think about is when does that start to grow for you in terms of revenues? When do you start booking and so we see it in backlog? And really doesn't that have a negative margin mix as you transition work from Virginia class to Ohio replacement, and how should we think about that transition?","Phebe Novakovic","So let me talk to you with that. We have, over the last three years, been increasing our revenue and our performance on Ohio, all in the engineering and design portfolio side of our business. Those margins are all in the cost plus work tend to be less than mature in production construction on submarines, right? So you've seen that that quarter-over-quarter for the last several years, and that along with the two per year for Virginia has driven some of the growth. That will - from my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward, until it begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. The - while we don't have specific time lines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early, likely to see a taskless prologue. Some early material purchases so that we can, you know, we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will program will really begin to ramp up really in the 2020's and go on for some time.","The margin profile way out then is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured, and I don't know. We don't know yet, and I think the Navy, we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex naval ship building programs, the first ship is cost plus, but that's the Navy's decision and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But, again, it's past is prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their cost and improving their manufacturing efficiency hull over hull. So this is a very important program for General Dynamics. Increasingly now, but very much in the future.","Samuel Pearlstein","And if I just looked at that past, do you typically do the long lead? Is it two years ahead of the boat construction starting? When do you start that long...?","Phebe Novakovic","I think it's about two years before.","Samuel Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Doug Harned","Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Doug.","Doug Harned","Hi. I wanted to continue in Marine. The other big thing that is coming up is the competition for the TAO205, the LXR and the LHA8. And when you look at that, one would naturally see NASSCO as the choice for the TA205, Ingles is the logical choice for the other two ships. But how do you see NASSCO's position in competing for, particularly the LXR? Can you use the MLP hull form and be an effective competitor in that part of this competition?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, we've already submitted our bids and, you know, I'll get myself in a really sticky wicket if I spoke to the Navy about relative competency. But we know how to build the TAOX, no surprise, and we've bid appropriately on that entire solicitation. So I think that's about all that I'm permitted to say. Sorry about that.","Doug Harned","Okay.","Phebe Novakovic","Ask the Navy. See what they say.","Doug Harned","No, I understand.","Phebe Novakovic","I ask the Navy, so.","Doug Harned","Okay. And what do you see as sort of the timeframe now on how that's going to play out, that decision?","Phebe Novakovic","I'm told that it will be sometime this year.","Doug Harned","For the...","Phebe Novakovic","But I don't have any more clarity whether it's third or fourth quarter.","Doug Harned","Okay. Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi.","David Strauss","A couple of questions on Gulfstream. I think your large cabin delivery guidance for 2016 was 104? Can you tell us what it is now, with some of the push out? Is the plan still to hold Gulfstream EBIT flat beyond 2016? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","I'm not going to give you the 2017 guidance. What I told you is, we're going to do 2016 at flat EBIT and that looks very, very possible from our perspective. I think we're moving one large cabin airplane from this year to next and a couple of mid cabins.","David Strauss","And Phebe, can you explain the large gap between green large-cabin deliveries in the quarter and completed? I don't think I've ever seen that large of a gap.","Phebe Novakovic","Oh, it's all timing, and it is the druthers of the customers on what they want in terms of outfitting them on their airplanes and any special configurations. There's nothing there that's particularly anomalous, simply timing.","David Strauss","All right. Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi.","Robert Spingarn","Hi. So maybe we'll switch to IS&T for a minute; I wanted to ask you about two things there. Just on this big IDIQ on jitters for the handheld, three of you participating there, competing, so I wanted to ask you how you think about that in terms of orders for the contract, how that might impact IS&T sales and margins going forward? And then separately, this stretch of WIN-T and how that might affect things? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Sure. So as it was reported in the press, we were down selected along with two others for what is essentially a 12.7 billion, five-year hunting license, and it- the way we're thinking about it in the moment is we deliver the next generation radio hardware in this quarter for evaluation and then full wave production follows that, conceivable this quarter and next.","One thing that I think is interesting to note, is we've got the only radio that's a proven MUOS capable terminal. So that ought to, from another perspective, be a by the competitive advantage. You know, it's, with these IDIQ programs, you've got to sort of handicap what you see as your win rate. We typically have been very successful in our win rates, but again, it will be highly competitive and we're just going to have to work our way through it.","This is a mission systems, where this resides is a high-operating leverage business, so I would expect them to perform nicely on those IDIQ contracts that they win.","WIN-T is, you know, WIN-T has slipped more than a skater on the ice. We're in increment two; it's in full rate production. It's going to be fielded to the next, I think, to an active brigade combat team and National Guard units over the next eight, nine years. And it is already in the field and successfully supporting down range missions. So from a financial perspective, it's performing very nicely. It's sort of up to our customer on what the pace of deployments will be, but heretofore we've managed, because of our intimacy with the customer, we've managed to accommodate their desires nicely, and I would expect that to continue.","Robert Spingarn","So, Phebe, net-net, it sounds like the jitters is a positive relative to what you're thinking might have been when you initially provided 2016 guidance, and therefore, is it fair to assume that you'll bake that in with when we hear from you next on this?","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah. If, in fact, they start to issue the IDIQ purchase orders within this year. So that's part of what I don't know, right?","Robert Spingarn","Right. So it could be a 2017 thing?","Phebe Novakovic","It could be. But I don't know. So...","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe, I wondered if you could talk to the booking strength in IS&T and maybe even the margin strange in IS&T, sort of the difference between IT and Mission, give us some color on that, and maybe where some of that strength is coming from?","Phebe Novakovic","So let's talk about this in two parts. Our Mission system is still benefiting from the cost synergies we achieved by combining two of our businesses. They're also - and by the way, that's why I was interested in that combination. But the business unit guys were saying and oh, by the way, in addition to cost savings, we're going to see some marketing synergies. And I said, yeah, good, great. Well, it turns out they were right. So they have won more than their fair share, and that's reflected in no small measure in that $1.3 book-to-bill. And their performance, operating performance is really terrific.","Now, this margin rate in the moment is a bit high going-forward. And while I'm not ready to update guidance, this group should be a double-digit earner in the near future. We've got additional opportunities for margin improvement in efficiencies and performance, and it - the margin performance in this group on the Mission Systems side is heavily driven by the product mix.","On the IT side, again, this is a very competitive business, with terrific cash flow, and as I always like to tell everybody, great return on invested capital. They are very disciplined when they go into the market, and they win their fair share. And I say disciplined, we're careful that he we don't, you know, pursue contracts down rat holes where we don't think we can get a decent return.","Carter Copeland","And in terms of their pipeline, do you expect to continue to see win rates like this? And you know, obviously the market is, as you stated, pretty competitive, but clearly you've seen this trend for a while now.","Phebe Novakovic","So, you know, it is very difficult to project win rates in such a short cycle business. I've been pleased with how they've done. They can - they've got more performance opportunity, cost cutting opportunity, as they would quarter in, quarter out, and so, you know, a combination of performance and cost efficiency, dedication to schedule adherence to schedule, schedule is not a guideline, right? Those are the things that make you win, and these businesses are firing on all cylinders, so I'm pretty place pleased.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks for the color, Phebe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jeffries.","Phebe Novakovic","Hey, Howard.","Howard Rubel","Good morning, Phebe. Thank you. To go to Combat Systems for a moment, I mean, you know, it's always lumpy when we see ads to the backlog, but keeping it stable at this point seems pretty good, given the large contracts you're working on. Could you address what you're seeing in terms of incremental interest internationally?","Phebe Novakovic","So as you and I have talked about on this call before, the world remains a dangerous place, and that Russian fair is roaring. So we've got considerable interests in interest in places that you might think.","Just to give you a little bit of color on some of the contracts that we have just put into backlog, the Swiss Army is purchasing 4.4 combat vehicles, and that went in I think this quarter for about $400 million, U.S. dollars. So that was good. The Czech Republic is on the map, as is the Spanish 8 by 8 technology program, and our land systems is in good position on that - on that program. And then we continue to see demand signals coming out of the Mid East. Iraqi tanks, Kuwait and in other parts of the Mid East where there's some really hot wars going on. So you know the pipeline looks good internationally. And if you look at the Army budget, they're beginning to recapitalize, so that's pretty wholesome in and of itself.","So, again, as in the IS&T case, our ability to perform with contract, keep our costs down will be the key to, again, winning more of our fair share. And oh, by the way, our armaments business is doing quite nicely as well.","Howard Rubel","That doesn't surprise me. Just sort of a little bit related to profitability, just to go to Marine for a second, the numbers were really good, could you address in some way how you were doing on Zumwalt and some of the other programs, just in terms of capability. Because, I mean, they seem to be surprising a little bit on the bottom line?","Phebe Novakovic","So let me give you some clarity on this program. Operationally, the ship is performing quite nicely; it's been out on two sea trials and we like what we see and, more importantly, our customer seems to. But let me remind everybody of a couple of things.","First, we are not the integrator of prime on this ship, the Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into the program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider.","The second thing is our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about a quarter. So, again, that gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know, is that that VAS has experienced some cost growth primarily on the first of cost ship, which is the cost plus help. But that's not a surprise given the complexity of this ship. And we continue to work close closely with the Navy to ensure that, you know, we're delivering the ships that they want and that they need operationally and that, you know, we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk from the second two ships.","The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000 and we've seen some impacts, as we started up a co-line, the 51s. And by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different and upgraded than the former flight. So we're confident that we can work through these, and we know these ships.","So, again, we're working with the Navy on scheduling costs so that we can ensure we get them what they need with profitability that we require.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much, Phebe. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much, and good morning","Phebe Novakovic","Good Morning.","Seth Seifman","I'll ask the capital deployment question this morning and basically, obviously there's not really anything to quarrel with in a billion dollars of share repurchased in the quarter, but it's not the first time that you've bought back a billion dollars, and you know, given sort of the underlying objective of the repurchase program to be opportunistic, obviously you've had some opportunities in the first quarter, how do we think about share repurchases going forward and, you know, would you characterize what you did in the quarter as opportunistic?","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah. I mean, we believe that the stock was undervalued, so we went in and bought and we'll continue to do that in instances where we think the market has mispriced our stock. That's our view, and we've been consistent about that strategy. So I think that's not a particularly big change.","Seth Seifman","Right. And any color about the level of repurchases going forward?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, because we're opportunistic, you know, I'm going to have to see, you know, we understand in the absence of M&A, it's, and given the investments that is we're making in our gross businesses, I think it's a reasonable, shareholder friendly action to take, and, frankly, you know, never forget, it's all about the shareholders.","Seth Seifman","Yep. Absolutely. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Myles Walton","Can I ask a question on cash flow? And I know last year 1Q is a tougher comp and most of the advanced burn was in the second half of last year, but the improvement in conversion from herein out through the rest of the year, should we expect that to kind of pick up the pace and do you think conversion will actually be better than last year before you get to full conversion in 2017?","You know, I think the way we think about that, and I think we signaled this before is that, you know, we the expect the free cash flow profile this year to look similar to last year. As you mentioned, it was a particularly tough comp from the first quarter of last year, which far outstripped our expectations and outstripped really a typical Q1 profile. The first quarter is usually a slightly softer cash performance and frankly, sometimes in the past it has even been negative. So on balance, I think you look at the year as similar to last year. It will fluctuate a little bit on the timing of some of the remaining progress payments and outflows on the international programs.","Myles Walton","Okay. And then, Phebe thinks for the color on the 650. But I'm curious, is there a level where you think the pre-owned stock becomes more of an obstacle to you selling aircraft or pricing, or maintaining the price?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, let me be clear. We're not going to drop the 650 price, or the 450, 550, based on the use. We don't compete that way. But let's talk about that used market. And it's not a homogeneous market. It's highly differentiated by model types. So let's think about it in two respects. You've got the 450, 550 used market that is mature, it's established, it has demonstrated factors that influence its behavior, and we have watched it now for well over a decade. The 650 is an immature developing market.","So let me parse, if it would help a little bit, let me walk through both of those markets. So with respect to the 450, 550, we did lose some G550's to the used inventory because there were a lot of them, the late models, that were available, and there still are to some degree. But this is an active market, it's a very active market, and so it has pretty good throughput. I think in the last 12 months we sold - the market sold 29 used G550's. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates.","And conversions. I hear less about the 450's used market, but I think the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now, the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane ordered to a used airplane.","I would also comment that, as I noted before, this pre-owned market is developing, it's a developing market. For example, it's not clear how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been there in there for three years and not lowered the price. And there's not been a transaction there for some time.","The early 650's, the early models, N numbers that were available to sellers or are available, are attractive at favorable prices, above the original sale price. Those were earlier on, but, you know, we've got to see how that market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used markets get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative to observe outcomes.","Myles Walton","Okay. So you're comfortable with continuing to grow and pricing won't enter the discussion, but you're sold out for the next 24 months. So that's kind of the landscape as we see it right now?","Phebe Novakovic","Very wholesome.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thanks.","Erin Linnihan","And Liz, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolf Research.","Hunter Keay","Hi. Thanks for getting me on. I appreciate it.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. So Phebe, you talked about the difference in time between green deliveries and completions, and as it relates to customer preference. I'm wondering if that sort of implies maybe you shift away from fleet sales and more to sort of individual purposes. And maybe I'm just reading too much into it? And can you confirm that one way or the other? And can you also talk about, generally, how you think about margins versus fleet sales to the individual one off purchases? Thanks very much.","Phebe Novakovic","Okay. So I wouldn't read too much into the timing difference between green deliveries and completed. I mean, there's really nothing there.","With respect to fleet and - and individual, let's talk about fleet. You know, fleet can be a fair number of aircraft going into a Corporation to replenish their, and refresh their active fleet. There's another series of fleet buyers that are fractional. We have very little exposure to fractional markets. And then there's another set of fleet buyers that buy for the Airlines. So that's a little bit different as well. And, again, we don't have too many of those.","We are very careful on our pricing, very careful. So don't think about those as materially different.","Obviously you get some volume discounts. But we have a pretty strict pricing discipline. Okay?","Hunter Keay","Got it. Thanks a lot for the time.","Phebe Novakovic","Great.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3583. Thanks, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Tihisha and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of IR, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you Tihisha and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","","Good morning. As you can observe from our earnings report, we enjoyed a particularly compelling quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.05 per fully diluted share on revenues of 7.75 billion, and income from continuing operations of 694 million, this is $0.21 per share better than the year ago quarter and $0.14 per share better than consensus. Revenue was up 60 million against the year ago quarter, operating earnings were up 38 million or 4%, and income from continuing operations was $42 million higher. Operating earnings of 999 million reflect 12.9% operating margins, a 50 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2013.","Sequentially the news is much the same, revenue was up 277 million, 3.7%. Operating earnings were up 50 million on a 20 basis point improvement in operating margins and earnings from continuing operations were up 48 million. Finally, EPS was $0.17 better than last quarter. In short, we experienced the highest revenues so far this year, had the highest operating earnings in four years, the highest margins in six years, and the highest earnings from continuing operations on my watch. This led quite naturally to the strongest quarterly EPS we have ever had, all pretty powerful and the strong indication that our focus on operations is paying dividends.","With respect to cash, we had 2.33 billion of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 330% of net income from continuing operations. We have 3.46 billion year-to-date, 179% of net income from continuing operations. However a word of caution here, some of this cash is from advanced payments on international orders and will be deployed in future quarter for pragmatic purposes and leans the balance sheet. That having been said, it was still a very powerful quarter from a cash perspective.","With respect to share repurchases, in the quarter we repurchased slightly less than 3.8 million shares for approximately 468.5 million. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 28.8 million year-to-date for about 3.2 billion. We plan for modest share repurchase activity in the final quarter of the year with a resumption of increased activity early next year.","As you can see from the backlog charts that we attached to the press release, this quarter is also a story of continuing growth in the backlog. Once again there was a substantial intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog. We ended the quarter with the total backlog at an all-time APEX of 74.4 billion up from 71.1 billion at the end of the last quarter. All of this growth occurred in Combat Systems Group largely the result of international orders. You may recall that at the end of the third quarter of 2013 Combat Systems had a backlog of almost 7.8 billion. It now stands at 21.6 billion, more than a three-fold increase.","If we look back over the last year for the entire Company, you will see a similar story. Our backlog has grown from 47.8 billion a year ago to 74.4 billion today, from my perspective, pretty impressive.","Looking forward towards the fourth quarter, we would expect the Aerospace Group to enjoy very strong order intake as the result of the introduction of the two new aircraft announced this month, along with a growing interest in existing products, impart precipitated by the new product announcements. In other words, customers can now choose between the near-term availability of G450 and G550 and no longer wait for new products, with different speeds, ranges and price points. The clarity of these options for customers is helping drive decision-making.","Before I turn this cal over to Jason Aiken to give you some segment details, I will note that I was particularly pleased by the revenue and earnings growth of the Aerospace Group, the continued excellent margin performance of Combat Systems, the revenue growth in the Marine Group, and the steadily improving margins at IS&T. We\u2019re not where we want to be at IS&T but we\u2019re improving. Jason?","Jason Aiken","","Thank you, Phebe. As Phebe indicated, the quarter was marked by very strong operating results from each of our business groups. I\u2019ll start with Aerospace.","Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenues, earnings and margins were all up from the year ago quarter, as well as for the first nine months of the year. The Group reported sales just shy of $2.3 billion up from the third quarter of 2013 by 6.4%. Operating earnings increased 11.4% over 2013 to $411 million, the highest level of quarterly earnings the Aerospace Group has ever seen. Operating margins were up 90 basis points to 18% on improved performance in G650 and G280 manufacturing and outfitting, as well as another good contribution from Jet Aviation.","On a sequential basis, the Group experienced some margin compression from the first half consistent with our expectations. This is attributable to a variety of factors but primarily to the mix of aircraft deliveries and an increase in pre-owned aircraft activity. Of course the aircraft\u2019s mix is more than just large versus mid cabin, keep in mind it includes the variety of models within those categories.","Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues and operating earnings were also up compared with third quarter 2013. In the quarter, sales were up 6.8% to $1.4 billion, while earnings were up 1.8% to $232 million. Taking with the second quarter that was essentially flat year-over-year, it would appear that we found the bottom with respect to sales for the Group. As expected the Group\u2019s margin rate while exceptionally strong was down from a year ago when the Group posted its highest margins in its history. In fact barring the third quarter of last year the Group\u2019s margin this quarter were the highest they\u2019ve ever been.","So far this year the Combat Systems Group has experienced very strong performance with an operating margin rate of 14.4% year-to-date. When we look sequentially, revenues were down $70 million from the second quarter, but operating earnings and operating margins were both up, $12 million and 160 basis points respectively. This reflects the impact of the various restructuring actions taken in the past 18 months across the Group\u2019s businesses, including a significant reduction in our European cost base and last year\u2019s combination of two of our U.S.-based businesses. With the last of the European restructuring charges taken in the first quarter of this year, the Group\u2019s margins have expanded significantly from the first quarter to the second, to the third. The cost reduction efforts position the Group well to execute on their strong backlog.","Moving onto Marine Systems. The Marine Group\u2019s revenues were higher than 2013 both in the third quarter and the first nine months. Revenues in the quarter were up by 7.2% to over $1.8 billion, while year-to-date revenues increased by 3.7% to nearly $5.3 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the Group\u2019s submarine programs and commercial ship construction activities. The Group has started construction on the fourth block of Virginia-class submarines which was awarded in the second quarter and is continuing development activities on the Ohio-class submarine replacement program. Construction is also underway on the first three of 10 Jones Act ships under contract at our NASSCO shipyard.","Operating earnings were steady compared with this point last year to $170 million and the Group\u2019s operating margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift. The Group is transitioning from Block-3 to Block-4 of the Virginia-class program and from the Mobile Landing Platform program to the new commercial ship contracts at NASSCO. However, margins for the first nine months of the year remained very respectable 9.7%.","And finally IS&T. You may recall that we had expected a 20% decline in revenues this year for IS&T, but based on the strength of the first half of the year we adjusted that expectation on last quarter\u2019s call to a 15% decline. The Group continues to outperform our top-line expectation through nine months, with operating earnings following suite. Revenue of $2.25 billion in the quarter was off by about 13% compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter. And on the other hand, operating earnings declined just 6.5%, roughly half the decline in sales to $202 million. As a result, operating margins increased by 60 basis points to 9% in the quarter. This is the Group\u2019s highest margin rate in the last three years, and marks the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion. All three of the Group\u2019s businesses contributed to this improved performance in the quarter.","The story for the first nine months is similar. Revenues were approximately $6.7 billion down only 11.7% versus the expected 15%. However, operating earnings were down only 4.3% resulting in 70 basis points of margin improvement. When we look sequentially, revenues and earnings were both up $84 million and $14 million respectively. And as I noted earlier, the Group has expanded margins sequentially since the fourth quarter of last year demonstrating good operating leverage and the Group\u2019s ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business.","On that front during the quarter, we announced the decision to combine Advanced Information Systems and C4 systems effective January 1, 2015. We expect this combination in resulting restructuring efforts to make the combined organization General Dynamics Mission Systems more efficient, profitable and responsive to our customers.","I\u2019d like to cover just a few miscellaneous financial items before I turn it back over to Phebe to wrap it up and begin the question-and-answer period.","The net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the third quarter of 2013. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the quarter our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $5.1 billion and the net cash position that\u2019s cash and equivalence in excess of debt of $1.7 billion. In this regard you should reflect on the cautionary note Phebe introduced on this subject in her earlier comments.","Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected due to the resolution of some open matters related to our 2013 tax returns. For the full year now reflecting on our experience to-date in the tax rate of 29.8% for the first nine months, we now expect an effective tax rate around 30%. We funded our pension plans in the quarter as anticipated bringing our contributions through the first nine months to just over $500 million.","And I\u2019ll turn it back over now to Phebe to give you some wrap-up thoughts.","Phebe Novakovic","All right. As we turn to guidance, I will be brief. Somewhat higher revenue, higher than anticipated operating earnings and a modestly lower tax rate combined to permit us to increase our guidance for EPS from continuing operations to $7.60 to $7.70, approximately $0.25 up from our last discussion with you.","Now, let\u2019s get on to your questions. Erin?","Erin Linnihan","Thanks Phebe. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Tihisha, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","No problem. (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","Good morning everyone. Phebe I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this backlog at Combat Systems and what it pertains for margins out in the future, would you just offer your view on how profitable that increased book of business might be and the sustainability of margins in Combat Systems?","Phebe Novakovic","If we look into next year margins ought to look about the same as they do this year, because we really expect the ramp-ups in \u201916 and \u201917 and beyond. As we go through come down our learning curves, we\u2019re going to improve our operating earnings and margins. These will be very profitable programs because they\u2019re in our core we know how to produce them. And so we have strong expectations for Combat Systems\u2019 margin performance.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","Okay, great. And then at IS&T, can you talk a little bit about the contracting environment that\u2019s going on there today? And whether you feel like things are getting markedly better, staying the same on the margin, getting a little worst just kind of contract terms as well as the cadence of bookings and the size of bookings?","Phebe Novakovic","We\u2019re not seeing much of a change in our contract terms and conditions. And still as a result for us margin expansion is all about performance. And we\u2019ve seen some of that improved operating performance throughout that Group. Just give you an example we had a book-to-bill of one for the quarter in IS&T so nice order activity. And I really haven\u2019t seen any material change in the contracting.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee","Thank you. Good morning Phebe. Just a question is on IS&T, you\u2019ve talked about the combination here creating this Mission Systems business, and you just mentioned the contracting environment. Do you think this business ultimately can continue to see margin expansion or is there something structural that keeps it below 10% for the long-term?","Phebe Novakovic","I see no reason why this business can\u2019t get into the double-digits. We undertook this consolidation but the markets are changing so it was an opportune time for us to take a fresh look at our entire portfolio. And it became pretty clear to us that we were going to benefit from a consolidation. So from my perspective, the consolidation is going to result in additional cost savings going forward. So that is margin expansion opportunity.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee","Okay, I\u2019ll stick to the one. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Phebe can you talk a little bit about the $0.25 improvement in terms of the guidance, in terms of where that\u2019s changing, which are the different segments? Because I know, like as an example, IS&T, down 15%, is certainly down a lot less than that year-to-date so we\u2019d imply a pretty weak fourth quarter unless there is some changes amongst those?","Phebe Novakovic","No, I think our guidance reflects our year-to-date performance and the fourth quarter is going to look very much like what we are leading, we\u2019re guiding to on the overall Company. So Marine will be a little bit up. And everybody -- all the other Groups are pretty much steady. There is some margin compression in IS&T but not much. So, I think when we\u2019ve increased our guidance really to reflect where we\u2019ve been and where we see going forward for the remainder of the year. So this is uncomfortable with our guidance.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","But in terms at least for the four segments, did the outlook changed relative to what you talked about? I am trying to just understand where you\u2019re moving that increase of $0.25 from?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, it\u2019s really kind of across the board. We\u2019ve got higher earnings and we anticipate higher earnings in Aerospace, higher earnings in the Marine Systems and well and higher earnings in Combat. So a little bit margin compression as I said in IS&T in the fourth quarter. But when you roll it all up where we\u2019ve been and what we see for the fourth quarter 7.60 to 7.70 is we\u2019re very comfortable with that.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities"," ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","","Thanks so much. Good morning. Just a couple of things on cash, and Phebe mentioned that the conversion rate would obviously be above average of the first nine months, where do you expect us to go in the future, are we going to get back to 100% or below that as you burn through these advances?","Phebe Novakovic","","We\u2019ll be at about at 100% as we begin to take that cash of the balance sheet and send it upon its way to our suppliers. So, we\u2019ve target about 100%.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Okay. And\u2026","Phebe Novakovic","Still very good cash generation.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Yes, on the [buying] is there any reason why you are easing off in the fourth quarter?","Phebe Novakovic","We\u2019ve told you all and our investors that we would deploy all of, most if not all of our free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends and we\u2019re about at that point. So, we\u2019ll go a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but I expect to pick that activity back up in the beginning of the year.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","","Yes, good morning. When you talked earlier about the G500 and G600 and then the G450 and G550 and how this gives customers the opportunity for a lot of different decisions. But when you look forward on the 450 and the 550, what\u2019s the level of backlog that in terms of months that you\u2019re comfortable with to make sure that you can continue to keep production at the levels you\u2019re at today until the 500 and 600 come out. I am just curious where you stand today in terms of that and how you get confidence that you\u2019re going to be in a good position?","Phebe Novakovic","Let me give you a little bit of color on that. In the quarter our backlog increased by a quarter for almost all of our models 650, 650\/ER third quarter of \u201917, 550 first quarter of \u201916, 450 about the same, 280 third quarter of \u201915 and the 150 frankly the largest increase at the first quarter of 2016. So that provides us pretty steady production rate as we go forward to plan for the next at least 12 month period. And you recall we set our production rates at the end of the prior year and then we\u2019ll give you some details about those rates as we go forward. But it\u2019s too soon to predict, I think it's just too soon to project when we have any material changes in productions as a result of the new airplane. And when we get to that, get closer to that point we\u2019ll give you a little bit more clarity.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","So is it fair to say you are looking at having some flexibility there as you see how demand rolls out for each of the different models overtime?","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, we always have flexibility. I think that agility helps us keep our profitability high and as we balance resources against demand. So, I am comfortable that as we stand here today we\u2019ve got an executable plan going forward and as I said as we get closer to the entry into service of the 500 and then the 600, we\u2019ll give you a little bit more color on to, into the relative production rates.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, very good, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please proceed."," ","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","","Thanks. Good morning, good results. Phebe, just on Marine, the margins have come down a little bit the last couple of quarters and you have indicated that it\u2019s transitioning on the multi-years for Virginia-class plus the MLP over to the new commercial ships. How are the ships coming, I mean this is your, this was your business before with your current position and so as you look at the early stages of the curves in the ships, how are they coming and where do you think the margins kind of bottom out before we start seeing an uptick as they mature?","Phebe Novakovic","You pretty much got it right on the mix shift, we\u2019ve got mix shift from Block-3 to Block-4 and then the transition from the MLP to the Jones Act ships. It's an interesting, when you think about what NASSCO has been able to do, they have demonstrated that they can build these ships and meet the customer\u2019s needs competitively and profitably while they are continuing to deliver Navy ships. So the current work we have in-house at NASSCO provides us nice revenue and earnings for the foreseeable future. We\u2019ve got three ships in production they are all performing on or above plan. So I would -- now one thing one caution here is that think about commercial ship building as providing nice strong earnings but the margin are going to be a touch lumpier as we move from one ship class to the next ship class because these are shorter cycles and maybe ship building. So I suspect we\u2019ll see continued margin improvement at NASSCO and have elected photos as we work through some of these mix shifts. And I would suspect to see some of that next year and certainly going into \u201916 and beyond.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Just to be specific, so, next year you expect to see margins start to perk up?","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, they ought to be, it ought to -- I expect we haven\u2019t done our detailed planning yet but I anticipate that they will somewhat near this year.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Yes, thanks so much Phebe. So if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on Gulfstream, are the 650 margins kind of above, you said they\u2019re above the 450. Where are they relative to the 550? And in terms of cash, when do you expect to get initial signed contracts for the G500 and what kind of impact is that going to have? That should have a positive impact on cash. Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, so the 650, and 650\/ER margins are beginning to approach the 550 and I suspect sometime next year we may have the crossing point on that. We haven\u2019t yet planned out our cash in any detail with respect to the 500s and 600s. We expect to see some this year but more going into next year. And by the way, we\u2019ll give you a lot of color in the fourth quarter call in January about the order activity on both of those airplanes.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Can you give us some additional color on that, on that order activity, or just the reception? And, whether you\u2026","Phebe Novakovic","Yes. So we announced at the rollout that we had several orders, large orders. And the order activity has been very positive since then. But I don\u2019t really want to give you a battlefield update and we\u2019re just barely end of this quarter. So we\u2019ll be able to give you some confirm color and details in the fourth quarter call.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Thank you very much. Phebe, can you give us a couple of updates on a couple of ground vehicle programs, I think we are in a bit of a state of flux for you guys; one is AMPV and the other is JLTV. On JLTV, could you confirm, have you guys excluded yourself from bidding on the LRIP contract next year? Are you officially going to, are you officially out of that program at this point? And on\u2026","Phebe Novakovic","Yes.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Yes, I was going to also ask on AMPV. So if you give me an update on that, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, we haven\u2019t played in the JLTV market and on AMPV. We\u2019re continuing to work with our customer on options for where our vehicles may make some sense. But our mature programs and our tanks and strikers are doing exactly what we thought they did would do and very good margin performance and good earnings. So, we have a lot of stability on those as of today on our Ground Systems\u2019 domestic markets.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Okay, and just one quick follow-up. I missed it. How long was the wait for G650 right now? Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","It is just for 650 the third quarter of \u201917.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Phebe I was going to ask for some more help on Aerospace backlog, and just reconciling the book-to-bill with the extension of the backlogs for the models you talked about earlier. I suspect a lot of what\u2019s happening is you\u2019ve been working off a very strong 650 bookings back in 2011. So there is distortion. Is there a point at which we start to get current on bookings and deliveries\u2019 orders, the introduction of these two new aircraft create new distortion in the next couple of quarters as these orders come in?","Phebe Novakovic","So, you would aptly and correctly pointed out the, for the 650 order book. And given the length of time between order today and a delivery of that aircraft, is has some distortion in our book-to-bill. And we\u2019ve talked about that I think for the last five or six quarters. As we move into the new airplane orders, we expect something very similar. So, I think that we used to watch book-to-bill with great, in the Aerospace Group, with great, I wouldn\u2019t say consternation but detail. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s apt now. So what we watch for is the mix of the airplanes and so far our in-service models are doing very-very well.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse"," ","Okay. And then just switching topics a quick one if I could on a potential additional striker bridge, could you talk about any upside there in timing?","Phebe Novakovic","","That kind of depends on when we get an appropriations bill passed. As we\u2019ve got money in 2015 appropriations for the striker bridge, the customer is very anxious to get those vehicles. So, it was pretty much inline of what we planned for in \u201915 and \u201916. But as I said we don\u2019t have our detailed plans done, but there were no surprises.","Phebe Novakovic"," ","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of John Gordon from General Dynamics. Please proceed."," ","John Gordon - Morgan Stanley","","It's John Gordon from Morgan Stanley, but thank you for taking my question.","Phebe Novakovic","So you got a battlefield promotion here.","John Gordon - Morgan Stanley","That is right, Phebe, I wanted to follow-up on Aerospace margins a bit. When I think about sort of the progression throughout the year, I think it's safe to say that they have exceeded expectations. Earlier in the year you had highlighted a number of puts and takes, so when we think about your full year guidance now it seems like those aren\u2019t I guess the downside risk isn\u2019t coming to, I was hoping if you could just kind of give us a bit of color and maybe a play-by-play on what exactly drove the beats versus earlier concerns in the year and what that means as we look out into 2015 at risks and opportunities to improve margins from here?","Phebe Novakovic","So, the single largest factor particularly for this quarter in margins was pre-owned and we\u2019ve talked I think for the last couple of quarters about with a business of this level of complexity there are a lot of puts and takes, aircraft mix, the mix of service both in terms of volume and types of service, what, some service jobs come in with a lot more high content work, R&D is lumpy, G&A can be lumpy, the pre-owned in this quarter was significant and we didn\u2019t have much pre-owned in the first couple of quarters of this in fact zero in the first half of this year and we had three this quarter. So that is sort of I think well that is what affected our margins this year or this quarter.","And then for the fourth quarter we\u2019re looking for a pretty much the same, unless some margin compression but not a whole lot, again we anticipate a couple of pre-owned that carry no margin with it. Going forward, we believe that we\u2019re going to see some margin expansions particularly as the 650 comes down its learning curve or not done improvement from the 650 in fact and production in fact are never really done. And then in the out years when we start to ramp-up 550 or 500 and 600 production we\u2019ll see some compression in margin as we come down our learning curves. But again nothing that is remarkable or particularly out there.","John Gordon - Morgan Stanley","Got it, thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","Maybe first a clarification, the cash conversion that you expect in the fourth quarter and then usually it's seasonally strong you just don\u2019t know how much of an influence this pull forward will have and if you\u2019ll extend supplier\u2019s cash here from the events in the fourth quarter. But the real question Phebe is given the breadth of growth in the defense backlogs I mean it seems like you would in a place to I don\u2019t want to say declare a bottom for your defense business, but certainly look toward a potential for growth in 2015 is that across the defense portfolio in aggregate, is that an accurate statement?","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, let me talk about growth and let\u2019s go by Groups in the Marine Group you ought to see steady low single-digit growth year-over-year and we\u2019ve been predicting that and that\u2019s in fact what has happened. Combat Systems given the considerable backlog it has when we start ramping up production and that is largely going to be in\u201916 and \u201917, and I think you\u2019re going to see good bottom-line and top-line growth. And IS&T, we believe we\u2019re at the bottom and we do at least had a good order book in this last quarter. So, we see some good potential there. So on cash conversion thus far fourth quarter will be lighter obviously because we\u2019re beginning to disperse some of that cash to our suppliers.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Will it be positive free cash flow?","Phebe Novakovic","Yes.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research"," ","Yes, good morning. Phebe I wanted to explore a little bit the Aerospace margins in a different way. And if you just look at the incremental margin, this quarter it was 31%. The second quarter you couldn\u2019t calculate because the margin was up on down revenues. And the first quarter was also close to 30%. So I know you\u2019ll say there is a lot of moving parts in everything in there. But it does seem like the incrementals still come out to around 30%. Now, is there any reason why that shouldn\u2019t continue as we going forward? And then also if you could just update us on what your expected large cabin deliveries are for the year, if that\u2019s changed any from the second quarter?","Phebe Novakovic","No, we\u2019re at 116 large cabin and 32 mid cabin and that\u2019s on green deliveries.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay.","Phebe Novakovic","And basically the same for completions, so, look margins are going to be, and I think you\u2019ve seen, they are somewhat lumpy. They will -- earnings are going to follow revenue growth. But we will have lumpy margins for a whole series of reasons that we\u2019ve talked about at some length. R&D will fluctuate, net R&D will fluctuate, G&A will fluctuate, mix is going to fluctuate, pre-owned. It\u2019s a complex business with a lot of moving parts that you\u2019ve got a lot of puts and takes, right.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Right, and that\u2019s why to me it\u2019s still surprising that when you look at the incremental margins. They don\u2019t seem to vary all that much. It seems to be up around that 30% level.","Phebe Novakovic","Well, our performance continues to pay if it\u2019s just that you\u2019ve got in any given quarter there are things that are affecting it and activities that are affecting it. So we have on our gross margins on our airplanes continue to be very-very strong and we see improvement across the board, quarter-over-quarter. So, go ahead\u2026","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay, but -- one quick one maybe for Jason. How much were the revenues in the quarter associated with the three pre-owned aircraft?","Jason Aiken","Yes, one second. That\u2026","Phebe Novakovic","I think it\u2019s over 100 million.","Jason Aiken","Yes, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s actually closer to about 70 million, or so.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay, thanks very much Phebe and good performance.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Good morning guys, nice quarter. And Phebe I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what\u2019s going on with Russia and China with the sanction, but I think the corruption crackdown in China. Are any of those issues particularly the sanctions holding up any Gulfstream deliveries? And overall for both countries, are you seeing any orders being deferred or just slowing in general because of what\u2019s going on in those regions?","Phebe Novakovic","Not yet. The sanctions have only impacted us at very-very far margin, and more at Jet Aviation than in Gulfstream. And China, China has a history of variability in its order activity. So, I don\u2019t see anything abnormal there.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Okay, got it. And then just you touched on pre-owned market a little bit. Can you talk about the pricing that pre-owned market maybe by mid cabins and large cabins? Is it fairly stable year-over-year, not really improving? Or can you shed some color there?","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, it\u2019s stable. And we\u2019re seeing some improvements, particularly in the larger cabins. Price is affirming up in the pre-owned.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. Phebe it seems as if you\u2019re continuing to go through the businesses and find opportunities for either sell things or reposition them. And obviously you\u2019ve done one in Combat and then you have a small sale to MDA. Could you elaborate a little bit on some of the longer term objectives that you\u2019re looking for, for each of the businesses? I mean, you\u2019ve sort hinted at some of them and in the earlier questions. Could you provide a little granularity please?","Phebe Novakovic","Yes. So, in the case of Combat Systems, and by the way all of our internal reorganizations have been in response to changes in our market. So, as we looked at last year, our ATP and OTS business, it made eminent sense to go ahead and combine those two. Primarily some for scale but primarily to our cost reduction and that has executed beautifully. So, we\u2019ve got nice-nice margin activity at now the new OTS. The IS&T was something we\u2019ve thought about for a while. But again as our markets have contracted, it made sense now to integrate those two businesses primarily again for cost reductions. And we ought to see that, the margin benefit from that starting next year and going into the future. But also it provides us some scale which is helpful too in this down market. Look what we want to do in the down market is manage what you can manage and keep our margins as high as possible. So, we\u2019ve had a long road of recovery on IS&T margins, but I anticipate that they will continue to improve.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And then just I don\u2019t know, you said the other thing that you\u2019ve done is you currently took work in-house for Gulfstream and you've hinted at some exciting manufacturing changes, could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you\u2019ve done there to sort of take productivity and to a new level and what does that sort of imply for, what you are sort of setting a standard for other parts of the organization to look at these options?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, it\u2019s an interesting question now let\u2019s go to the, what we have done in anticipation of the new airplane. We learned a very important lesson with the 650 that a purpose build facility provides much greater margin expansion overtime, that plus the way these airplanes were designed if they were designed for producibility. So fewer parts and cleaner and clear build paper, work paper that get\u2019s out on the shop floor, so given that we have these purpose build facilities and the way these planes were manufactured or designed, I think we\u2019ve got very-very good earnings potential in the future. We\u2019ve taken some work in-house that we previously had outsourced so largely just as a matter of control and efficiency for some of these parts that we are now manufacturing at Gulfstream, the transportation costs are significantly less when you move it from one building right over to the next building. So that was a factor and how we thought about optimizing earnings potential going forward for these new airplanes. I don\u2019t believe that this is necessarily a model for the defense businesses, not something that they look at. The Marine Group is not a vertically integrated Group neither is our Land Systems. So they have a very robust and disciplined supply chain network and I don\u2019t see them bringing more work in-house.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please proceed.","David Strauss - UBS","","Good morning. Phebe where are you in the process of selling AxleTech?","Phebe Novakovic","As you know we moved AxleTech into discontinued operations and we are selling at and I think it\u2019s not appropriate to comment any further than that.","David Strauss - UBS","Okay. As a follow-up Jason, on the pension legislation half the legislation I know you guys deal with cash differently than everyone else, but how does that impact you from a mandatory contribution standpoint going forward does that help you?","Jason Aiken","","It does, I think like just about everybody else it brings down pretty meaningfully the mandatory contributions that we\u2019re projecting. That said, I think as you are aware of those contributions that we had in the past and are forecasting aren\u2019t necessarily potentially as significant to us as it maybe to others. So the reduction isn\u2019t something that we material, focused on as a material item that will change our cash flow outlook or anything else like that in a significant way.","David Strauss - UBS","Okay, great.

Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","","Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Erin and good quarter. Just a couple of quick clarifications, Jason you said that the contribution from Jet was good in the quarter, I wondered if you could characterize whether that was better than what you have seen in maybe the past couple of quarters? And then with respect to the Mission Systems\u2019 creation, I wondered if there were any restructuring or other expenses associated with the combination that are non-repeating for next year and if you could help us think about what that might contribute to next year\u2019s margin? Thank you very much.","Jason Aiken","I think with respect to the Jet Aviation question, we continue to see steady improvement in the business and year-over-year each quarter we\u2019re seeing improvement, second quarter to second, third quarter to third and so on. So we expect to continue to see that slowly and steadily improve in our operations.","Phebe Novakovic","Any charges with respect to restructuring will be taken in the quarter in which they are incurred and more than offset by the cost saving.

My name is Glen and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions)."," ","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan. Please proceed.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you Glen and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' second quarter conference call.","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter at General Dynamics with revenues of 7.47 billion, an income from continuing operations of 646 million. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.88 per diluted share, $0.07 ahead of the year ago quarter and $0.11 per share better than consensus. While revenue was 360 million lower, 4.6% than the year ago quarter income from continuing operations was 6 million higher on the strength of 12.7 operating margins, a 40 basis point improvement. Sequentially revenue was up 209 million in earnings from continuing operations were up 50 million on a 70 basis improvement in operating margins. You will note in this quarter that we took a 105 million after tax charge and discontinued operations for the planned sale of our axle business."," ","Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2014, revenues were down modestly 2.7% against 2013 however earnings from continuing operations were up over 2.6% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.17 or 5%. In short we\u2019re off to a good start ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations leading to an improved outlook for the year.","With respect to cash we had 791 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter about a 122% of net income from continuing operations. We had 1.132 billion for the first half, 91% of income from continuing operations and we fully expect a very strong third quarter.","With respect to share repurchases in the quarter we repurchased slightly less than 10.7 million shares for approximately 1.2 billion. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 25 million shares in the first half however do not expect share repurchase activity at this level in the second half of the year. We have frontend loaded the share repurchase program, we will in the market but at a more moderate pace.","An important part of the story in the quarter and for that matter in the previous quarter as well with the substantial intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog. We ended the quarter with the total backlog of 71.1 billion up from 55.9 billion at the end of the last quarter. Most of the growth occurred in the Marine Group, with the award of the Block-4 of the Virginia Class submarines. The IS&T Group also enjoyed a $468 million increase in total backlog.","You may recall that the story in the first quarter was the tremendous growth in backlog and combat systems. In short the company\u2019s the backlog and total potential contract value is at it's highest point in the last four years. This provides a solid bedrock upon which growth will be built. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the for the half. I will then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and give you our updated EPS guidance for 2014.","First Aerospace, Aerospace had a good quarter with modestly lower revenue 2.8% on mix shift. Timing of deliveries and absence of preowned sales. However stronger than anticipated margins at 19.2%, 30 basis points better than the year ago quarter kept operating earnings down only 5 million or 1.3%. Let me provide you with some complexion on the quarter. Gulfstream enjoyed continued improvement in 650 green manufacturing and completion margin that more than offset continued mix shift. Jet Aviation again made a good contribution with double digit operating margins.","For the first half of 2014 Aerospace revenues were up 289 million or 7.5%, operating earnings were up 89 million, 12.7% a further manifestation of Jet Aviation\u2019s contribution and the continued performance improvement at Gulfstream. This is all reflected in a 90 basis improvement and operating margins for the first half of the year versus the first half of 2013, all-in-all a really superb first half with a very nice order take in the second quarter. There was particularly strong interest in the G550 in the quarter.","Combat systems once again demonstrated disciplined performance reporting 15% margin on revenue only a half a percent less than a year ago resulting in modest increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter. Our domestic businesses have particularly strong margin on cost reduction initiatives and program performance. ELS which had been impacted in the first quarter by additional restructuring charges returned to profitability with double-digit operating margins that we expect to improve on an accelerating basis through the remainder of the year. All-in-all a strong performance in a tough market environment.","For the first half revenues are up 7.2% against the first half of 2013, operating earnings are down 16.5% principally as a result of the restructuring charge at ELS in Q1.","However we expect operating earnings to be very strong in the second half. More in that subject when I provide guidance. Marine Group revenues were higher than in Q2, 2013 by 92 million, 5.2% but operating earnings and operating margins were down 2.2% and 70 basis points respectively entirely as a result of mix shift in the quarter. Nevertheless, both revenues and operating earnings were up nicely on a sequential basis.","For the first half Marine Group revenues were up 67 million or 2% and operating earnings are up 3 million or 1% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.8 for the first half. IS&T, IS&T is the place where we expect tremendous revenues pressure for the year. You may recall that our initial guidance was a 20% decline in revenue year-over-year. Fortunately we\u2019re doing somewhat better than expected.","Revenue was off by 387 million or 15.2% compared to the prior year second quarter and also down somewhat sequentially. On the other hand operating earnings were down only 10 million or 5.1%, a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The story for the first half is even better, revenues were down 553 million, 11.1% but operating earnings were down only 12 million, 3.1% on improved margins. This was very good operating leverage.","Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up with our EPS guidance for the year. For Aeroscape our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately 9 billion and operating margins around 17%. We now believe revenue will be offset that figure by about 250 million, the largest single driver of which is lower than anticipated preowned activity.","On the other hand margins are expected to be about 18% for the year resulting in higher than anticipating operating earnings. The 18% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half largely due to mix shift and increased R&D spending.","For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenues to be off on unadjusted 2013 revenue by 4% to 4.5% with margins around 14%. We now expect revenue to off 2.8% from adjusted 2013 revenue or about 5.7 billion. Margins will be higher around 15% resulting in higher and predicted operating earnings.","In Marine Systems we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue growth over 2013 a 4.5% and a margin rate of about 20 basis points better than previously forecast, once again resulting in higher operating earnings.","For IS&T we previously guided to a revenue decline of 20% and a margin rate of 8.2%. It now appears that revenue will be down 15% and the margin rate should be about the same as our previous guidance, once again this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year. In summary all of this rolls into revenue for the year around 30.2 billion and operating margin of 12.5% and a return on sales from continuing operations of 8.5%.","So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations between $7.40 and $7.45.","The progression through the remainder of the year is -- of the third quarter will look a lot like the second with a very strong fourth quarter to finish.","And now I would like to turn the mike over to Jason Aiken to give you additional detail.","Jason Aiken","","Thank you Phebe. Good morning. I will touch on just a few miscellaneous financial items before the question and answer period. As Phebe mentioned the results for the quarter include a charge of a $105 million in discontinued operations. In the quarter we engaged in the plan to sell the axle business in our Combat Systems Group. This action requires that we assess whether the price we expect to receive for this business is sufficient to cover the carrying value of it's net assets including an allocation of goodwill. This assessment resulted in the charge you see in the quarter in discontinued operations. The estimate will be trued up when the sale is completed which we expect to occur by the end of the year.","Net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $18 million in the second quarter of 2013. We had additional interest income in 2013 that reduced the net interest expense in that period and for 2014 we expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million.","At the end of the quarter we\u2019re in a net debt position that\u2019s debt in excess of cash of $69 million. This reflects a $450 million swing from a net cash position in the prior quarter due to our activities on the capital deployment front which I will address just in a minute. As a reminder we have $500 million of notes maturing in January of next year and we will make a decision as we get closer to the end of this year as to whether to repay or refinance those notes.","Our effective tax rate was 30.2% for the quarter slightly lower than expected as a result of higher international earnings which carry a lower tax rate. Based on our experience so far this year and the growing impact of international earnings we\u2019re now expecting the full year effective tax rate to be at the low end of our previous guidance of 30.5% to 31%.","We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2014 to be around $550 million, as a reminder most of that funding is scheduled to occur in the third quarter of the year. With respect to capital deployment in the quarter we continued our commitment to deploy capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Phebe gave you the details of our share repurchases a few minutes ago and in total we expended almost $1.5 billion on share repurchases and dividend payments in the quarter. And over the past 18 months we returned over a 115% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. At the end of the second quarter we have $3.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well-positioned to continue to execute our strategy and achieve the objectives that Phebe has articulated for 2014.","Erin that concludes my remarks and I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan","Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you\u2019ve additional questions please get back into the queue. Glen could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","","I wanted to ask you Phebe on the Aerospace. You\u2019ve done so well with the margins here and you\u2019re guiding down a little bit on mix and R&D I think in the second half of the year but given that you\u2019ve traditionally level loaded your R&D even if you should come out with a new program in the fall, might we expect that this guidance continues to be a bit conservative especially with continued improvement at Jet.","Phebe Novakovic","Let me walk you through that a bit, as you quite rightly point out we anticipate seeing some margin compression from mix shift and higher R&D and that\u2019s net R&D because we do not anticipate the same level of launch assistance so that is -- we level it low at our R&D but launch assistance drives some variability. Say fewer jet contributions going forward. But I think it's a good opportunity to spend a moment on Aerospace margins a bit and to give you a little bit additional color on what drives the variability quarter-over-quarter in these lines of business. The fundamental principle that I think we have to keep in mind the underlying operating performance of each of these businesses is getting better quarter-over-quarter and if it weren\u2019t I would tell you.","So what does that mean? Well this means that there are other factors in these very complex businesses that impact margin, not one of which is necessarily material but in combination they can have some impact on a quarter-by-quarter basis. You know we have got mix shift between large cabin and mid cabin and service mix that mix. Also on volume by the way and it depends on the kind of service volume. The more complex service work, you get the higher margins you carry and for Gulf and this is true both at Gulfstream and Jet.","","For Gulfstream as an OEM the more parts that they sell out of warranty, the higher the margin. So there is even within the inter-service business some various margin variability. With respect of Jet Aviation you get margins that are quarter-over-quarter, somewhat driven by where we\u2019re in contracts. Think about Jet as a construction contract and what they do particularly with respect to completions. With newer contracts we start off with lower margin and then build as we come down our learning curve. So again that drive some variability.","Sales expenses of both business has changed and as I noted launch assistance is lumpy and of course as you all well know preowned is almost always a zero margin business. So I think -- I thought it was worth just spending a little bit of time talking about why it is that we see some variability. I emphasize again though that the operating the fundamental operating performance remains improving quarter-over-quarter.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","I wanted to ask if also with the 650 are we at the point where that\u2019s margin accretive and you mentioned better order flow there, obviously you\u2019ve been sold out for long time. Is the order renewal or the -- what I would consider new momentum maybe it's not. Is this a function of a change in the end market or is it because the other guy is now probably fairly sold out so availability is no longer a differentiator.","Phebe Novakovic","Well availability is a differentiator to the extent that you actually have product. I think the way to think about, you had a couple of questions here but let me answer your last one first. I think the way to think about 650 demand is that we continue to see demand for that airplane, new demand and we have added not in large quantities as you would expect when there was a four year wait. But we have added almost every single quarter 650 orders. So that continues, there is a lot of interest in that business and by the way as we have worked through on that line of business in that airplane, as we work through the backlog we have accelerated the availability dates by about two quarters. So that\u2019s a benefit to our customers as well.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So that\u2019s higher rate?","Phebe Novakovic ","It's a higher rate and you would expect that as we have come down our learning curve and as we continue to move green airplanes through the manufacturing line and then into the completion centers. With respect to margins I believe that 650 margins, I believe that I told you -- I told the Street maybe last quarter that we have exceeded the 450 and are working our way up to the 550 but that\u2019s probably several quarters away.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.","David Strauss - UBS","Phebe on IS&T you did revise the revenue guidance off now down 15% but still calls for a pretty significant larger decline in the second half of the year, can you just talk about what\u2019s driving that? And then on combat margins, it looks -- if I got it right, it's 15% margin guidance? It looks like it's implying a pretty big pick up in the back half of the year if you can just comment on that as well. Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Yes. So let me address your last question first, I told you all in the first quarter that combat margins was significantly and quickly recovered and they did and they were even more. I mentioned in my remarks that we took a $29 million restructuring charge in Q1 at ELS and with that behind and that business hits 10% margins this quarter and we expect them to continue to improve over the course of the year and both of our businesses continue their strong performance. So it's pretty much in-line with what we had anticipated. Going forward they are just doing better than we had thought and that\u2019s why we\u2019re raising our margin guidance for the year.","With respect to sales on IS&T we had believed that the frontend would be, the first half of the year would be somewhat frontloaded and it does imply some sales slowdown in the second half and that\u2019s consistent with what we had anticipated. We were pleased that the sales decline was less intense than we had thought and by the way that was across an entire spectrum of the businesses in both our IT business and Intel Business and coms business. So that was a nice sales performance in the first half and then some of the decline in sales that we anticipated that I think I told you guys before that this was -- we were risk adjusting our plan for army exposure and then that has happened but I would note that some of those we\u2019re seeing indications that some of those lines of business are beginning to stabilize.","For example in our tactical ISR comps, computing, modeling and simulation were all -- we took our decline but they are holding up pretty well. IT services worked for the army is also holding up nicely.","What continues to be a weakness and a weakness that there isn't a whole lot that we can do anything about is in the sustainment and repair business. The army is taking all their work into the public depots [ph]. So as a result we\u2019re doing almost nothing for the army in that line. So I think that addresses both of your questions.","Operator","Your next call comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Two quick questions, mix was worse in Q2 than Q1 but the margin was a little higher in Q2 to -- versus Q1 in Aero. So I was just wondering what your explanation for that was and then the other one is I assume the book to bill would have been above one if I took out the fact that it was probably below one for the 650 and you are still expecting a 118 large deliveries for the year. Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic ","I had a little trouble following the puts and takes on the first part of your question but let me address the orders because I think that\u2019s kind of what you were getting at a little bit. We had a book to bill of about nine times and it was really a good, good strong order quarter for us. We had said that -- what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of interest in the pipeline. It's just taking longer to close and so we have found that we have some variability in our order intake quarter-over-quarter and that\u2019s what has happened. This quarter a lot of those orders came to fruition. So it was a nice quarter. By the way I have been tracking for you all the 450 and 550 which is where we look for these, where we would like to see in the moment. The order activity and once again for 450 and 550 they were 75% of the order book. The 280 was also strong.","With respect to our green deliveries, we set a target every year that is right at the plan around how many green deliveries that we intend to have in the quarter or in the year and it's primarily driven by a host of factors. We have frequently taken it upon ourselves to sometimes rephase those deliveries. So you noted that we had slightly fewer deliveries in the second quarter than the first quarter but that we were -- we anticipate upticks in particularly the large cabin orders in the deliveries in the second half of the year. So all of that is meant to say that some of the timing -- some of the deliveries on green has been a question of timing and we have rephased that. So I think we\u2019re looking at the moment which could change in about a 116 versus a 118 and again simply driven by timing.","You would be surprised how frequently customers ask for flipping the green delivery or the completions delivery into the next quarter subsequent quarter or the subsequent year. So again it's nothing but timing.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","On the first quarter what I was getting at was you had 29 large and six mid-sized versus this quarter, 26 and seven. So I figured the mix was worse this quarter yet the margin this quarter was 19.2% versus 19% in the first quarter so you kind of overcame the mix maybe because of 650 productivity.","Phebe Novakovic","You got it. That\u2019s it. Improvement on the 650 and also on the 280 but you got it, 650 did very well.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay so why won't that continue in the second half?","Phebe Novakovic ","Well because of all the reasons I have just explained. We have got a mix shift among those three kinds of categories, large cabin, mid cabin and service and we have got higher R&D and Jet\u2019s contribution while good, is going to be less. So those three factors are a compression on margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Could we shift to NASSCO, maybe tell us a little bit about the commercial ship building business, how it's doing and the prospect you\u2019ve for new orders.","Phebe Novakovic","","For a number of years we talked about the impending return of the Jones Act market and it came and since that market has picked we have contracted for 10 Jones Act ship. It remains a very attractive market to us and the pipeline remains fairly robust and we\u2019re in constantly communication and dialogue negotiations with potential customers. It's a good market, it's a price competitive market as you might imagine but I would note that this is not a place and not a market in which compete solely on price and are willing to use price as a differentiator, it's just too much risk in our profitability.","So, we\u2019re in the midst right now of ramping up a member of our new commercial orders and that has some -- you didn\u2019t ask this question but it's implied, margin compression in the group but again that\u2019s simply a question of moving from mature MLP and coming up the learning curve down the learning curve on commercial. So it's a nice market, it fills out NASSCO work flows very, very well. We have learned to build these ships efficiently. So I like it.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Given that basically you\u2019re building essentially the same ship, should we expect the margins there to improve so this becomes a mix process as opposed to currently a mix negative?","Phebe Novakovic ","Overtime absolutely but you would expect that from the shipyards, right?","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Yes, okay. And I mean --","Phebe Novakovic ","By the way these are not exactly the same ship, so don\u2019t think about it as a serial production on exactly the same specs. But there are differences but that said this yard will perform -- better and better performance as the programs mature.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Phebe on the AxleTech divestiture, this is I think one of the first portfolio decisions you\u2019ve made after -- you mentioned last year you were overhauling the M&A procedures internally. So I was wondering if you could comment on the process you went through in deciding to divest why you\u2019re doing it and whether you\u2019re looking at further divestitures, if this sort of opens the gates to lot of more portfolio activity.","Phebe Novakovic","","Sure. Just to give you a little bit of retrospective, AxleTech was for many years a very, very good business, as we were the merchant supplier for almost all of the variances of MRAP. We made a lot of money on that acquisition years ago. As the war wound down and the government decided not to initiate a program to repair or retrofit MRAPs the fundamentals of that axle market changed dramatically and now the -- what we see is think about it this way, a complete inversion of the demand curve on commercial with the demand curve of defense work. So that told us that and we believe by the way that\u2019s a systemic change. So that told us that the value proposition really no longer obtained for us and that we believed and I still do that a commercial facing owner could be could be a better steward of the company.","So I think you can expect us to respond as a market when we believe that there have been systemic changes and reacting according to our shareholders best interest. We have done a number of little pruning through like very small lines of business really limited in products just as again we changes in the market. But when we put together ATP and OTS we did a strategic analysis of every single one of our lines of business and what was core and where we thought that we could add value and this was one of those businesses that we felt could do better with a different parent and a different home. So I think you would expect us to react to our market.","I don\u2019t see any major divestitures on the horizon. We have tinkered within the IS&T portfolio but nothing that changes the nature of that portfolio. So these will be opportunistic as we proceed and make these decisions fairly deliberatively and we have a very disciplined process for executing the sales. So I think this was a wise move and it's good for all.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Can you provide us with the expected level of proceeds from the divestiture?","Phebe Novakovic ","Well not yet, everybody who is a perspective buyer would be listening. So, we will disclose how we do after we finish the transaction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","You\u2019re in a position at Gulfstream where you\u2019ve got G650, a unique position in the market. You\u2019ve said that the 550 has strong interest yet right now you\u2019re at the lowest level of backlog in aerospace in one in five years and I\u2019m just trying to understand how to fit that level of backlog with the program strengthens you\u2019ve?","Phebe Novakovic ","So Doug, I\u2019ve tried to articulate this before. Think about our backlog as driven primarily by and predominantly by the 650 order book that we took in 5 or 6 years ago. That backlog provided for five or six years of sales activity on the 650. We\u2019re drawing that down and I think that\u2019s indicative as we would expect and totally wholesome and I believe that that\u2019s an implied from the acceleration in the availability times by about two quarters which I just told -- we just discussed a few minutes ago. So we had a book to bill of 0.9. I don\u2019t worry about the level of the backlog given the duration of that large program. I think it's very wholesome. There was nothing that we see in the order activity that causes us concern. Our pipeline is very robust, it's robust on the 650 as well. I think the customers and potential customers will be happy that they don\u2019t have wait for quite such a long time for their airplanes.","So I don\u2019t worry about this. This is not some harbinger of a market issue at least with respect to us that I think we need to be worried about or our shareholders need to be worried about.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Well do you see a point here as you start to -- as you increase that availability take rate up. Should we expect the backlog to eventually turn up the other way as you start to increase rate or is this something where you see this kind of level as sort of the right level going forward?","Phebe Novakovic ","Well look a lot of depend on a number of factors, all right? Including how we think about new airplanes that we may bring into the market. So you know the right level of backlog is the backlog that you can that sustains reasonable sales growth and allows us to continue to be a very profitable company and I think that we have got that now and I don\u2019t see any sign that that\u2019s going to be particularly troubling. I don\u2019t have a target backlog. That ebbs and flows.","The 650 was such a large order that you have to think about it more like some of the big ship orders. It was big and it was binary, that\u2019s unusual in the business Jet Aviation market, right?","So it is pervaded [ph] that backlog but if you look prior to the 650 announcement our backlog was pretty consistent driven by the economic environment and as we have added more airplane models we have increased that backlog and then the 650 just changed the nature of that backlog. So I think we have all gotten used to seeing it but it was an anomaly, because rarely do you ever see I don\u2019t think ever has anybody ever seen that kind of big and binary change, more like the ships right?","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","I understand, it's just that when I look at the numbers today and you think of sort of backlog to revenues the numbers are actually even lower today than they were prior to the 650 launch in terms of that ratio. So I just wanted to understand if you saw an issue there but it sounds like you\u2019re seeing things as pretty much where you want them to be in terms of demand.","Phebe Novakovic ","Yes and absolutely and let me just also say that I think the entire industry right around the run-up to the great recession. The market was unhealthily overheated. I look to see -- I look at backlog to ensure that we have enough in our order book to sustain a growth in sales and a growth in profitability. I\u2019m very comfortable where we\u2019re now and I see no signs in our market that it's superheated or that we\u2019re experienced any particular anomaly or something that we should be concerned. That\u2019s why I have been reporting to you all where we look every quarter in our backlog as a 450-550 orders because you can\u2019t add materially to the 650. That dynamic with respect to the 650 will change as we shorten the availability times, right?","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","That absolutely makes sense and certainly that\u2019s one of the things that we have looked for is that you\u2019ve this upward pressure to see when you can take those rates up and even get more availability.","Phebe Novakovic","And there you\u2019ve it. But we\u2019re not about pre-announce that, we make our rate decisions based on very disciplined analysis those of factoring a whole lot of independent variables right? So that\u2019s within our I think in our to-do list, right?","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","First I actually want to ask Jason a question, I figured you didn\u2019t want him to be there or neglected and it looks like the way you bought back stock it was very much backend loaded when we look at the share count so that we should expect to fairly sharp decline sequentially in shares outstanding in the third quarter versus where you were in the second. Is that correct?","Jason Aiken","When you say at the end of the third quarter or is it at the end of the second quarter?","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Excuse me, I apologize. It appears as if you have bought most of the shares towards the end of the second quarter because the difference between the weighted share count in the period and the share end number is fairly significant.","Jason Aiken","I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go to that conclusion. The activity was spread right throughout the quarter and what you maybe seeing as the offsetting impact of stock option exercise activity and other factors that go into the weighted average calculation but no anomaly driving the share count or the repurchase activity towards the end of the quarter.","Phebe Novakovic","","We did an accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter but the second quarter was just steady eddy throughout the quarter.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And then second Phebe, you\u2019ve focused a lot on making a difference cost as an effective competitive tool. Could you address a little bit of how that\u2019s helped you either win some business or positioned you to win some business both at combat systems and at IS&T?","Phebe Novakovic","Absolutely. One of my favorite subjects. Let me give you the easiest and the most glaring frankly example. At ELS we had a cost structure going into 2013 that was so high it made them anti-competitive, just couldn\u2019t win any orders. So we needed to get after that cost structure and we did it quickly, in a disciplined fashion. We did the same thing at GDUK and the results we\u2019re seeing is in GDUK we actually had a C4 [ph] owns GDUK. We actually had a contract that we had been disqualified from because of high cost.","We opened for us to go back into the competition because we had lowered our cost so dramatically and in a head to head competition with multiple other suppliers we won. I mean that is a simple and I think powerful example of what right sizing your business can do. It's a right thing to do for your shareholders, for your customer so that we can provide the services at competition rates and the same thing is happening in European Land Systems. So those were the two obvious examples but we\u2019re seeing that throughout as C4 Systems has reduced it's business and restructured it's business dramatically since the fourth quarter of 2013.","They have increased their order activity particularly in their overseas market, Canada and the Mid-East and to the extent that they are going in head to head competition. We have been doing very, very well in our capture rate. The same thing is true with our Intel business and the same thing is true with our IT business. So I\u2019m very pleased with the performance of the company as we have focused getting back to the basics of operating excellence and they have got more to go but they have made progress. Combat Systems has had a long track record of disciplined response to their market and anticipating changes in their market and getting after their fixed cost quickly. There is no such thing as we say as fixed cost, they will ultimately turn into variable.","So they have right sized their business even in advance of the change in their market conditions and I think you can see the result of that in their margin improvement, and in their margin performance.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Just to follow-up on land systems or combat, I\u2019m still sort of looking at sort of the market color for opportunities. Can you either geographically or product line or some way characterize how there has been very specific interest?","Phebe Novakovic ","So we continue to see within our land force as U.S. Land Forces line of business. Interest in terms of sustainment levels right? So we anticipated that and we see that, it's not a lot of -- I don\u2019t believe new opportunities on that front. We\u2019re however engaged in a number of international opportunities with all of the three businesses in our combat systems. The timing of the clarity around timing of international orders has been a little elusive, so I\u2019m not about to speculate but our negotiation on several potential contracts and we will see how those turn out but there is still a lot of interest. The world hasn\u2019t gotten any safer.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Just wanted to follow back up on the AxleTech discussion. Can you just size that business and I\u2019m trying to just think about how much of the original sales decline was because of that business and then the absence of it how that\u2019s playing into the combat outlook for the year?","Phebe Novakovic ","You can sort of infer that from the restated sales number but that business has for the last really year undergone a precipitous decline in sales and the inversion of demand. So, I\u2019m not going to parse out exactly the size but you can -- when we get around to selling it we will in disposing of it and finalizing the contract will give you a little bit more clarity but it was responsible for some of the decline clearly, you can see that.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","","And then you had mentioned about risk adjusting for the U.S. Army business. If I remember right going into the year, you implied kind of a 40% reduction year-over-year, can you talk about where you stand year-to-date and what you\u2019re expecting now from U.S. Army business?","Phebe Novakovic ","Yes, so that business is consistent other than the sustainment of that line of business which really hits the IS&T business units more than it does the combat systems business units. We\u2019re down to around 20% and declining.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Just question regarding announcements made by peers yesterday on two fronts the first obviously you\u2019re partner on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program took a pretty sizeable charge with the completion of that and renegotiation with the customer and they have lengthened out the entry in the service dates on some of those aircraft. I wondered if you could speak to the impacts that you may see from that and how you will go about evaluating that and then secondly, Lockheed who is a set contractor on the scout vehicle to you, he was talking about a pretty sizeable award they were excited about from a potential standpoint from the UK and I wondered if you could speak to timing and size or just general color about that opportunity and what it could mean for GDUK? Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic ","","Yes let me talk about MHP. For the first time in many years this program has a stable way forward and has upside opportunity. We did not take charge on that program, we don\u2019t intend to take a charge as a result of the renegotiation. We\u2019re the supplier for Sikorsky. We have developed over the years a very good relationship with our supplier. We have been very supportive with our prime. We have been very supportive of them and this was a very significant risk reduction result for us and we have stabilized it and going forward there will be some upside. So that was very, very good move. On the SV vehicle -- Lockheed may have more information than we do but I have, this is one of the many, many markets that we continue to investigation and we\u2019re there. We\u2019re at the prime and on the SV [ph] - the development of the SV and how the British government and the Ministry of Defense chooses on a going forward basis to think about the production contract, it's something we start to work out with them but they are going to make that call.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","How would you think about the significance of that order relative to some of the other big orders you\u2019ve talked about in combat in the past?","Phebe Novakovic","","Well it would be a nice order and again that is entirely driven by the druthers of that customer and what they want to see in near term production. So, the developmental program went from a very risky position to one that we have stabilized that and we have gotten it back on track technically scheduled wise and we\u2019re -- we have done a good job and land systems team did a very good job. I\u2019m a big believe that if you don\u2019t build the platform you can\u2019t integrate it.","So they build those platforms, they know them, it's our core competency that\u2019s probably one of the best in the world if not the best in the world at that and they were able to turn around a very broad program. So it's an opportunity going forward but that will be dictated in its entirety by our customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America","On Gulfstream just to maybe follow-up on some of the previous questions. The increase in activity that you\u2019ve seen, you\u2019ve mentioned in your prepared remarks about the G550. Can you speak about regionally where you\u2019ve seen it? Is it out of the emerging world? Is it out of Europe? Is it out of the U.S.? Where are you seeing maybe the tick up in demand?","Phebe Novakovic","","In each one of our airplane models what we have seen is North America is the 50% of the orders for the last 18 months. So pretty consistent North America involvement and activity in ordering. Sometimes that small fleet, corporate fleet replacement or individuals but I got to tell you the vast majority of the orders are from Fortune 500 and both primarily North America, public and private companies but also international public and private companies.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America","Okay. And in the midsized market have you seen much of the pickup there yet or is that still kind bouncing along?","Phebe Novakovic","","The 280 had a nice quarter and that airplane gets overshadowed by the 650 but it is a terrific plane in it's space and it's in niche and it's doing well. It's fits a discernible need with great capabilities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada ","Phebe, also related to your peers it does seem that a couple of them have been picking up their M&A activity since the start of the year. Are you in any way tempted to get back involved in this game?","Phebe Novakovic ","We have seen -- look I\u2019m not going to speculate on that we have seen a bit of a trickle but a trickle is not a trend mix so it's hard to know the maturity of the M&A market but so far we\u2019re not there.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada ","And then as a second question, really a follow-up to Ron\u2019s question. Have you seen any changes in the pricing dynamics for new aircraft?","Phebe Novakovic","No our prices are holding up nicely. But the corollary to your question is we\u2019re not winning these airplane orders on price, it's factor but it's one of many.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank ","Maybe talk about the capital deployment for just a second. I know you have made a mention of the $500 million note coming due in January and your decision has been made to refi or repay yet. And I just wonder that in any way going to play into how you\u2019re going to deploy free cash flow for repurchase. It looks like it's about a $1 billion after dividends of free cash flow you will have in the second half of the year to maintain this neutral position you have now on net debts. I think about that as your repo target unless I\u2019ve to think about the refinance or repayment of the note as well. So if you can maybe -- are those two connected?","","Phebe Novakovic ","","Well I think if you think about it that note is due in January. We really haven't gotten -- we really haven't put our -- focused our attention on 2015 capital deployment but you can rest assured we intend to be shareholder friendly as we have in this year.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","And then clarification are you still holding 40 midsized deliveries in \u201814 or is it just picked up in the midsize in terms of demand or maybe it's a little bit less.","Phebe Novakovic ","We have had a couple of move around so nothing particularly material.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi","Phebe just a quick question on margins. I wonder if you can just give us some updated thoughts on what you think normalized margins at Jet Aviation are going to be over the longer term and then same for combat systems. Just long term structural margins in that business over the next several years is, you look at all the cost activities that you\u2019ve taken over the past couple of years and make the business going forward.","Phebe Novakovic","","Jet Aviation has been a story all about walking out of the shadow of the valley of death and they -- their margin performance has been increasingly positive quarter-over-quarter. They have some variability but on a quarter-to-quarter basis but the underlying operations have done very, very well and will continue to do well in every indication we see all of the metrics we watch, the EACs we built. Everything I see is on the upper trajectory and I think it's too soon to have for me to give you a definitive where out there sustaining margin to be.","I have an aspiration that I\u2019m fully confident that Jet will make but that\u2019s an internal discussion that we have to have but they are on the right path. Now combat, I think combat -- you know combat is all going to be about their orders which they have stabilized their order and then their performance on those orders and these lines of businesses have demonstrated that they are very good operators. So I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself for 2016 but we ought to see some nice margin improvement in combat. There is nothing structurally that\u2019s keeping them from not continuing to build their operating efficiency and add to it.","And operator I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton ","Phebe, I just want to ask you about 2014 guidance overall especially the defense revenues you\u2019re forecasting. It looks like all the congressional appropriations committees have reported out but it looks like maybe won't create a bill until after the November election. I was just wondering if you feel like there is any risk to your guidance from a CR [ph] that goes to November - December?","Phebe Novakovic ","Not anything we can materially see. Most of what we have got is in our backlog upon which we have projected our guidance to you.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton ","","Okay. Thank you.","","Phebe Novakovic","All right.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 for fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion, and income from continuing operations of $864 million. The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially in line. Most of the beat occurred on the tax line. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20%, attributable in large part to the CSRA acquisition. However, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All five reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter.","Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction. In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings absent the amortization expense related to the transaction were $1.2 billion with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million, or 1%, and operating earnings were up $47 million. The two quarters were very much alike.","On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion, or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million, or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million, 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $790 million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures at Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the nine months, as the business units continued to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers' requirements.","As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year, and $5.6 billion increase over the year-ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2 times and a sharp increase in its estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contracts. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4.","Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $36 million, or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat, off $5 million, or 1.3%, to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million, or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins, as expected. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million, or 6.4%, and operating earnings are off $133 million, or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin.","The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago.","We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollars values of orders. Gulfstream alone was 0.9 to 1 on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contretemps surrounding NORDAM's financial issues and its inability to deliver nacelles to Pratt on schedule. This caused numerous G500 and G600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That, I am pleased to say, is behind us and should help fourth quarter intake.","Gulfstream has taken over the production of nacelles and is making very good progress on both cost and schedule. Deliveries of nacelles are in line to support the 8 to 10 G500s next quarter.","I can also tell you that our pipeline in sales discussions are quite active. We are, again, reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look better than the third quarter, even accounting for the increased delivery in Q4. On a trailing 12 months basis, the book-to-bill is slightly in excess of 1 to 1.","Our certification front continues to progress well on the G600 and we anticipate certification shortly before year-end with deliveries commencing next year. The G600 has profited from the work done on the G500, so those first delivery lot will carry better gross margins. The G500 with 5,200 nautical miles of range at 0.85 can travel 4,400 nautical miles at 0.9. Just to put that in some context; 4,400 nautical miles was the approximate range of its predecessor, the G450 at 0.8 mach, cutting nearly an hour from long-range flight. The G600 with 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.85 mach has now also demonstrated 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.9 mach, actually quite stunning.","If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have done so with the G500 and will do so with the G600.","Next, Combat Systems, Combat had a solid quarter with revenue of $1.52 billion, operating earnings of $241 million and 15.8% operating margins. Compared to the third quarter in 2017, revenue was up $23 million, or 1.5%, but earnings were down $6 million or 2.4% on a 70 basis point decline in margin. On a sequential basis, the second and third quarters were very much alike, with no material difference in volume or profit. Year-to-date revenue was up over 2017 by $296 million or 7%. Operating earnings are up $24 million, or 3.5%, despite a 50 point basis decline in operating margin. I should point out that Combat Systems has now reported quarter over year-ago quarter increases in revenue for eight consecutive quarters. All of our major programs are performing well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically. Importantly, our work with the U.S. Army has increased nicely. In addition to fully supporting the Abrams main battle tank, the Army has recently placed a $383 million order to upgrade 173 Strykers to the A1 configuration, the newest, most powerful and capable version of the vehicle. The order will complete the fourth brigade and begin the process of modernizing the fifth, part of a process to modernize all nine brigades. We are also actively involved with the Army's longer-term modernization efforts and have developed innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their requirements.","For Marine, the group reported revenue of $2 billion, a $72 million or 3.7% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. In contrast, revenue was down sequentially by $165 million, or 7.6%. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $169 million were down $10 million compared to last year's quarter. As expected, there was a sequential decline in profit margins due to mix.","Year-to-date revenue of $6.2 billion was higher by $261 million, or 4.4% and operating earnings of $548 million were up $30 million, or 5.8% over 2017. Revenue across the year has been driven by construction of the Virginia-class Block IV, Block V design and Columbia design work. Offsetting this was timing related to ship repair and other naval construction work. With four recent awards for repair work, we should expect a step-up in volume for that category.","Just prior to the close of the quarter, we received a multi-year contract from the Navy for four DDG 51 Flight III ships. The $3.9 billion contract affords Bath the opportunity to move down the learning curve and improve its performance. The ships are scheduled as part of the FY 2019 through 2025. We told you last quarter that we would report IS&T in two segments, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, one of the leading providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agency and federal civil agencies.","Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems' revenue at $1.23 billion was $144 million, or 13.3% higher than last year's quarter. Year-to-date revenue of $3.48 billion was higher by $249 million, or 7.7% over last year. Operating earnings of $179 million were up $27 million, or 17.8% compared to the third quarter last year, with mix and the benefit of operating leverage generating the better performance. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings were up $27 million or a 6% increase. I have already commented upon Mission Systems' very strong order intake in the quarter, which further supports their anticipated organic and future growth.","Moving to Information Technology, the business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in the quarter, up $1.2 billion or 116% over the year-ago quarter. The revenue for GDIT was up 7.1%, excluding CSRA. By the way, we're not going to be able to break out CSRA revenue for you after this year. Operating profits were $1.57 million, up $56 million or 55%. Reported margins were 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter. But excluding the acquisition related amortization of $64 million, margins were 9.6%.","CSRA was modestly accretive in the quarter. It is $0.05 accretive year-to-date, excluding transition costs. This is really quite remarkable this early in an acquisition. The integration plan is sound and continues to deliver early results.","Finally, we've announced the divestiture of our call centers to MAXIMUS as part of our portfolio-shaping strategy. This transaction creates focus on enterprise IT solutions and high-end professional services. We are business-to-business focused and this shifts us away from the more public-facing markets. These assets are well-placed with MAXIMUS, for whom it is core. By the way, this transaction will have no material impact to 2018 results.","So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned, we fully expect fourth quarter revenue in excess of $10 billion and operating margins consistent with the last quarter. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate of around 21% in the quarter. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date offset in part by the $75 million of CSRA transactions costs and a lower-than-planned tax rate enabled us to increase guidance for the year from a range of $11 to $11.05 to a range of $11.10 to $11.15 for the year.","This late in the year we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. As tempting as it may be this time of year to ask us about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight in the upcoming year. The guidance we gave you last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in January with more detail, as has been our custom for many years.","So let me spend a minute telling you how I see this year in perspective. We are growing 4.9% without CSRA. We have double-digit EPS growth. Gulfstream is growing at 4.5%, and that's particularly impressive during a year of transition. The CSRA integration is ahead of schedule. The U.S. Army is recapitalizing, and the Marine group is steady as she goes. And Mission Systems is performing beautifully. And finally, our backlog is large and growing, which puts us in very good stead for next year.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.","Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $355 million.","Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter and 17.1% year-to-date. This is lower than our previous expectation and is attributable to the finalization during the quarter of our 2017 tax return. As a result, we are lowering our target for the full year tax rate from our previous estimate of 19% to a rate in the low 18% range. This implies a fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 21%.","One more point on the income statement. We had a discontinued operations charge in the quarter of $13 million or $0.04 per share. You'll recall, we sold a piece of the CSRA business due to an organizational conflict of interest issue. Under the accounting rules, this sale resulted in a breakeven pre-tax GAAP P&L outcome. However, there was a gain on the sale for tax purposes, and the tax expense on that gain is reported in discontinued operations.","Turning to capital deployment, we paid $275 million in dividends in the third quarter and purchased 450,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $522 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady.","In addition, as Phebe discussed, in light of the benefits associated with the recent tax reform, we made a $255 million discretionary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter and have ramped up our capital expenditures, which we expect to be in excess of 2% of sales for the year. We also repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper in the quarter, consistent with our priority of rapidly repaying the debt issued to finance the CSRA acquisition. To that end, we expect to fully repay our CP balance by the end of the year, which will retire over a quarter of the borrowings from the acquisition.","Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was over 90%, excluding the discretionary pension contribution. And for the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional pension contribution.","Finally, one more follow-up to Phebe's comments about our order activity in the quarter, the total company book-to-bill was 1.4 times in the quarter, resulting in a 5% increase in the total backlog to $69.5 billion. And when you include options and IDIQ contracts, the total potential contract value increased to an all-time high of $104.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This backlog growth is all the more impressive given the ongoing headwind presented by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which impact our Combat Systems segment, in particular, given its significant international footprint.","Specifically, over the first nine months of the year, FX rate changes driven by the strong dollar reduced the segment's backlog by $600 million. Of course, this is an accounting translation effect with no economic value implication, but a headwind to the reported numbers nonetheless.","Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back in the queue. Gary, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the G500 and just this whole NORDAM situation. Only because United Technologies talked about a settlement, I believe, that there was a cash inflow. So, can you help us in terms of any impact that might have had in terms of the P&L and did it occur in this quarter or is it something that is still to come in the fourth quarter?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So, there were no material adjustments to revenue or earnings as a result of this settlement. That said, the details of the settlement are subject to a non-disclosure agreement, so that's all we can say.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, David.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Phebe, I wanted to ask about a couple part question on Gulfstream. So, I know you said you didn't want to talk about 2019, but I think this is fair game since you've talked about before, just the operating income cadence from here in 2019 and 2020 relative to the $1.5 billion for Gulfstream. I think you talked about a slight increase in 2019 and a slight increase off of that in 2020, how you feel about that now. And then, NBAA, we heard comments about G550 orders coming through pretty well and the rate going up there, but we also heard about maybe a little bit nearer-term availability on G650; if you could tell us where that stands today. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So, let me just get clarity on the first part of your question. Can you restate that for me?","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. So, previously, I believe you've talked about $1.5 billion in EBIT at Gulfstream in 2018 and then a slight increase in 2019 and a slight increase off of that in 2020. If that still holds, how you feel about that. Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So, I don't want to get into 2019, but think about it this way. We have 8 to 10 of the G500s delivering this year that carry really relatively very low margins. We'll have the remainder of that lot delivering in 2019. And then, as we move into the G600 production, those margins are going to be higher since the G500 carried a disproportionate burden of the test program. So, all-in-all, we're comfortable with the implied guidance that we gave you back in January this year and that's about all I could go into at the moment until we set all of our production rates. So that's with respect to that.","On the G550, we adjust that rate accordingly. We haven't made that decision yet, but there is very nice demand for that platform, particularly in the ISR space. So as long as there continue to be government customers who see this as a powerful ISR system, and then we'll continue to produce those at fairly low level. And the availabilities of G650 are still out there. I'm not aware of any near-term availabilities whatsoever.","Operator","The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, good morning, all.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","I just want to go back quickly to the NORDAM settlement. I mean UTC was pretty explicit yesterday that they had a $300 million payment related to that. So I can appreciate the terms of the NDA, but just methodologically speaking, if you didn't have a gain in Q3 and the guidance doesn't imply a gain in Q4, like where does this $300 million go?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","First of all, no one can discern the number. Second of all, it is simply not material. So I \u2013 and while UT can be a little more expansive on this agreement, we, however, are bound by a nondisclosure, which I will not violate. So there you go.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Phebe, on the defense side of the business, obviously been some issues with Saudi Arabia of recent. I was wondering if you could comment on what the potential backlog exposure you have is to Saudi Arabia and whether this is having any impact on your near-term order prospects.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So I don't know what the backlog is. We don't look at it in that regard. I will tell you the largest contract we have is with the government of Canada. We are continuing to build that vehicle on schedule, and we see no indication that that contract has changed, the status of that contract has changed in the moment. So, steady as she goes.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Phebe. Quick question just, I guess, on Marine Systems \u2013 I mean, Mission Systems. The margin performance continues to be really impressive there. 14.6% and 13.8% year-to-date. I mean, is there a natural ceiling here for margin when you look at the contract mix? Or what's the kind of cadence, I guess, when you think about Mission Systems?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So, Mission Systems margins are driven most especially by mix and product mix. And that can, in any given quarter, in any given year, vary. But their performance, I think, is indicative of their future performance, again, driven by their mix. And it's wholly dependent on thousands of different products and simply the timing of the orders and the profitability of various different products within that portfolio.","Operator","The next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, can you just do me a favor and parse back that comment you made around the margin differential between the G500 and G600, particularly around the test flights? Is it fair to assume that the margins on the G600 should probably hit a double-digit rate before G500, despite the G500 deliveries ramping a little bit quicker?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Oh, I'm not going to parse that. I don't think I know that in the moment. And frankly, I start to get nervous about giving specificity of margins by airplane that becomes highly competitive. But the fact is, is they will carry better gross margins because they do not have the larger share of the test program. And you'll recall, there was a fair amount of commonality between the G500 and the G600 test program. So we'll come down quickly. We'll go up where margins will increase nicely on the G500 once we get through the first lot, and they will continue to perform well once we \u2013 it's an analogous performance on the G600. Think about it that way. But just at a higher start rate.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Hey. I have one clarification question, and one question. So on the clarification, you mentioned the fourth quarter color of greater than $10 million sales and segment margin similar to last quarter. I just wanted to make sure you're talking about 2Q and not the 3Q reported number?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Okay. 2Q. And then in terms of the top-line, the greater than $10 billion and the implied 4.9% organic growth, I just want to make sure we are triangulating to the right sales number, so we are now looking somewhere in the lower $36 billion? Is that right, for the full year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yes. Yes, and we gave you, you will be able to discern all of the particular puts and takes in the Q. We have laid all that out for you, okay? So that should help you.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Is there a particular segment, I imagine it's Aerospace on the G500 deliveries, is that right?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, there's Aerospace in two regards. One, it looks like we are going to have considerably lower pre-owned sales than we had anticipated, which frankly is a good thing from a bottom-line perspective. And as you quite accurately point out, we've had fewer G500 deliveries than we had originally anticipated. And then on the other defense groups, it's really just a question of timing and when the contracts get executed. So nothing of note across any of the defense units.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","On your comment, Phebe, about the book to bill of being 0.9 and you didn't have G500 and G600 orders delayed but you didn't deliver any G500s, so the fact that the book to bill was 0.9, does that imply G650 orders or G550 book to bill were less than one? And also, what's the number of months now that you are sold out to on each of those planes? Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So, I don't track that data that you asked for. And by the way, I have come to a conclusion that I'm not going to give you detailed, first available, because it becomes meaningless with all these new airplanes coming out. We may ultimately go back to that but there's too much churn in the next year or so because we've got so many new airplanes coming out. But they are well within the comfortable levels that I've talked about before, so I don't have any concern across our existing plane portfolio.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","But was the book to bill less than one for the G650 and\/or the G550?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","No, we don't track that.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. I will stick with my one. Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Painful as it is for you.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","That's right.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I wanted ask \u2013 hey, good morning, Phebe. I wanted to ask you about Marine, couple of things on Marine. The first and they're both on margins. I wanted to think about the ramp of the Columbia over the next couple of years, few years and how we should think about margins on that. And then separately on the DDG-51, the recent award, which has the Huntington pricing, you've got four ships there out of 10, how do we think about that impact from a margin perspective? I suppose while we're at it, perhaps we could talk about revenues too.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So, we were very pleased with the outcome of that competition with four ships, because it gives Bath a nice opportunity to improve its profitability. And if you think about Bath's performance, on the DDG-1000, we've had terrific ship over ship learning. We have delivered the first of the restart, I think, guess the second of the restart ships on the DDG-51 and the third is under construction. We are seeing some nice ship over ship learning there. So from my point of view, this is a wholesome development for Bath and gives us really the opportunity to get where they need to be.","With respect to margins, a bit large, I think in Marine. Right now, margin performance in the Marine group is driven almost entirely by timing and mix at Electric Boat. You've got higher Block IV and Columbia-class engineering volume lower margins offset by the lower Virginia-class Block III, a very mature contract that is close to \u2013 I think we delivered our final ship.","So, if you recall, you've been with us now through three of these block transitions and remember that we did these ships on a continuous learning curve. So, it's incumbent upon us to ensure that we've got the operating excellence moved down our learning curve and we've done that with all three ships, or all three blocks. And you're just going to see some of that again on Block IV.","There are, however, opportunities to improve those margins on Block IV, obviously, as we have in the past, and we've got improvements coming at Bath and NASSCO. Ultimately, margins can benefit as we \u2013 if you think about Columbia as we decrease our engineering work and move more toward construction of Columbia, but none of that will be clear until we get a contract in place on Columbia. And we don't think we're going to see that for the next year or so.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Should we think about, though, as your mix of business going to a less mature phase, though, so overall margins could drift down a little bit?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","I don't want to get out there too much on margins. I said something, I think, inadvisably the last time, I think, on this call. And the way that I think about these margins is, look, we've got quarter variability, but the trend is there. And there's a lot of moving parts as we move into Columbia, because the decrease in the cost plus decrease in the engineering work, which carries lower margins and the advent of construction, that offers some opportunities. So, I think that at the moment it's too soon to tell, but there is potential to get better.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I was wondering if you could talk about some of the portfolio-shaping opportunities you've had thus far. Is there space to do a little bit more in terms of trimming down CS GDIT or is that about it? And then, also on the other side, is there capacity to do more M&A, as that integration seems to be progressing well and you're progressing down the deleveraging process? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So as is our want, we are constantly looking for opportunities to shape our portfolio to better align our lines of business with our core. And in the case of the large public-facing call centers, they really have a better home with MAXIMUS, which allows us to focus on our core, enterprise IT, IT infrastructure and professional services and IT business solutions.","On a going-forward basis, we, as you can expect, will continue to look for portfolio-shaping opportunities. However, I think we've made it pretty darn clear, our priority for capital deployment is we're going to draw down net debt, pay down net debt fairly expeditiously. So, you should think about that.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So, Phebe, NORDAM, you took over the plant in early September, and you said that basically the orders were hurt because of uncertainty about delivery positions. Is it fully on track now? And, therefore, I assume you can offer firm delivery positions. And have we seen any pickup in orders? And what is the extent of the delay about, from the fact that they were kind of down for, what, 50 days or something without any production? Should we look for the first quarter to be a lot weaker than the rest of the year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, look, you quite rightly point out that we now own a line, and I am always more comfortable when I can control my own destiny, particularly when it's in our sweet spot of operating excellence. So, as you can well imagine, Gulfstream has started up that line, stabilized the supply chain and we're in the process of sending nacelles to Gulfstream to support our G500 and G600 deliveries this year. We don't have a \u2013 we are not at full rate production, it takes a while at the nacelles, on the nacelle line, it takes a while to get that up, and you can be rest assured, we will get there and then have real clarity around \u2013 and specificity around delivery times. And yes, we've seen customers who are increasingly comforted and interested because we can now give them with greater assurity you're going to get your airplane on date certain. So I consider that all very wholesome. Can you repeat the last part of your question?","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","I think, so we've heard that it's like a one-month delay. Excuse me, a one quarter delay. So should we expect that Q1, you're kind of going to be up or are we going to see Q1 still being very, very depressed because of the recovery from NORDAM issues?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Okay. I understand now. So the way to think about this is that we are reducing the impact in terms of time, shortening the time span as we increase our production on the nacelle. So it's really too soon to tell, but I think we will be well-positioned to support pretty robust manufacturing of the G500 in Q1.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. On Marine, there's been a lot of discussion around the Navy about the need for a larger fleet, but also certainly the ability to fund the growth. And history has shown these growth plans can have a lot of uncertainty. Can you describe how you think about your capital investment plans for Marine? Huntington Ingalls has raised theirs even more. I mean, when do you decide to invest and when do you wait?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, yeah, the key in any capital deployment investment is to, as quickly as possible, marry in terms of time the capital expenditure with the return. And so the Navy understands that and has worked very closely through contract provisions to ensure that that happens. We've got $1.7 billion in our facilities master plan, not exclusively, but well, actually exclusively at Electric Boat. And there's another couple hundred million at the other two yards in order to support this increase in Navy shipbuilding. So I am quite comfortable that our \u2013 particularly at Electric Boat where the preponderance of the funding is deployed and will be deployed is appropriate, and timed well to support the Navy's construction. This is all pretty wholesome. We have got to prepare for the construction of this very, very large and important Columbia-class missile boat. And that's what we're doing right now.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So that's the main \u2013 would that be the main focus then? I guess what I'm getting at is the Columbia classes, we've said, is a very secure trajectory. Some other programs may be less so and...","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, look, I am capitalizing for the ships that I know that I'm going to compete in. We do not capitalize for programs that have yet to become programs of record and fully funded and supported by the U.S. Congress. That's not a wholesome business decision.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. So I noticed a nice pickup in the backlog in Mission Systems, and since there are a wider variety of smaller programs, I guess, in that segment. So, just as we think going forward maybe relative to investment account outlay growth over the next few years which is probably going to be mid or high-single digits, how should we think about the ability of Mission Systems to grow relative to that? And are there any of the pieces of the business, are there any of them that are much more positioned to outperform or underperform that level?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So in terms of cyber, EW and ground forces communications and networks, we are very well positioned on a going-forward basis. If you think about the backlog increase, we had an award of a very large contract for IDIQ for CHS-5. And then we also had a new line of business, Life Cycle Product Management (sic) [Life Cycle Product Line Management] contract from the Army. So those were all \u2013 those were both very important, and provides a platform for continued growth. As the Army re-capitalizes and innovates around its ground forces, networking and comms, we are in the sweet spot of that relationship with the Army.","So look, a lot of \u2013 if you think about it, these very impressive win rates for high-cycle businesses are really driven by being a low-cost, high-quality producer with \u2013 undergirded by very strong intimacy with our customers to understand their needs so that we're bringing them the products and capabilities, frankly, irrespective of vendors that can best suit their needs.","Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.","And, Gary, I'd like to afford the time for one last question, please?","Operator","And that question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Phebe, just a follow-up on Marine. There was some news over the summer about missile tube production issues from at least one of the suppliers and I think some people in D.C. feared it could negatively impact the whole program from a cost and schedule standpoint. So I just was wondering if you could maybe talk about that and if you think it'll impact the program or if it's a problem may be easily resolved.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","So we have worked very closely with the Navy on ensuring that the issues are identified and resolved, and it has not had an impact on Columbia's schedule. But you raise tangentially an interesting point, and that is the readiness of the supply chain to support what is significant growth. And the U.S. Navy and the Congress have recognized that with an appropriation of about $450 million for precisely the purpose of supplier and Electric Boat production readiness. So you don't \u2013 you want to exercise that supply chain before you go into full rate production to identify any potential challenges, and we're in the process of doing that. This is a very important risk reduction effort that the U.S. Congress and the Navy have undertaken, and we are very pleased with it. So this is \u2013 more to come on that, all right?","Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors","Good color.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Abigail, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Erin, and good morning, all. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operation of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late in the year. Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9% respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%.","By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was and remains the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last four years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison. And that will be true in the business segments as well.","Sequentially, the quarters were very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on a 40-basis-point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about in a little bit more detail.","So, for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9% helped by a 200-basis-point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year.","Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for three reasons. First, we are working off the very large advanced payments received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream consistent with building numerous aircraft for test and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 program. And third, we were also working off large advanced payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs.","All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow.","Let me give you some color on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace, revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70-basis-point improvement in margin; very nice operating performance. For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sales, 5.9% on earnings, and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and good order intake.","During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what will be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and G650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and G650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next.","So, contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least one to one, both dollar base, one to one, and in units of green delivery, 1.1 to 1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and G650ER. By the way, an interesting data point is that there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good.","Let me say a few words about the large-cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good, but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good.","More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I should also point out that, despite the hand-wringing by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not ebullient, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEMs.","Combat Systems. Combat revenue was down $90 million, or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million, or 13.7%, on a 140-basis-point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15.4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group. Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million, or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million, or 2.3%, on a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and Ordnance and Tactical Systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings.","Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. By the way, in just a moment, Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance. This is a business poised for modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through 2019 timeframe as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog.","Now, Marine Systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year-ago quarter, and down $105 million, or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows a $600 million increase in 2014.","Operating earnings were down $21 million, or 10.9%, against the year-ago quarter, and down $9 million, or 5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million, or 3.6%, despite a 50-basis-point decline in operating margin.","In the Marine Group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceed by a fair measure. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue, but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings.","The growth in revenue in the year was driven by Electric Boat on two Virginia-class construction, sub \u2013 two Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio Replacement Program. This group's margins are the result of a mix shift; higher engineering work transitioning to Block IV from Block III and increased work on commercial Jones Act ships at NASSCO.","IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground and maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was the result of greater efficiencies than planned in business unit consolidation and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio.","Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 million, or 12.4%, against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult comparator as I had mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter were 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million, or 5%, on the strength of 10.6% margins, 70 basis points better than last quarter.","For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%; very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline.","On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this \u2013 in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All-in-all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margin. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast. On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5%, and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7%, and a return on sales of 9.4%.","Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We wound up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate, and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly a great year by any measure.","So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly. Margin rate should be down 10 basis points to 20 basis points and operating earnings flat to last year. 2017 should look a lot like 2016 with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver the G500 in the fourth quarter. Revenue and earnings growth will resume with full scale production and delivery of the G500 in 2018 (13:59) and the G600 the following year.","In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rate similar to 2015 with more vigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Marine group is expected to have revenue similar to 2015 but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range. Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year, an additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth.","Finally in IS&T we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 basis point to 30 basis point decline in operating margin that remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015's operated earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and 2018.","All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue, operating margin of around 13.3%, and return on sales of roughly 9.1%. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time on the same basis.","Let me also reconcile this forecast of $9.20 to our 2015 year-end result at $9.08. In 2016 we will not have the operating gain from the sale of a business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share. Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this suggests 2015 to $8.74 and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital.","With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by four, then take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, leave Q3 even, and about $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment.","With respect to the deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I'll have more to say on this subject at the end of the first quarter as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity.","As Phebe pointed out, the group's full-year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015. For the company as a whole this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%.","As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes, and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar.","Given where we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to be an ongoing part of the group's story. Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consist with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than the year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015.","For 2016 we expect net interest expense of around $95 million. And the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we've deployed cash off the balance sheet. As we've deployed that cash over the year, we've moved from a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million. And I'll walk through those capital deployment activities in just a minute.","Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark, slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress' enactment of tax extenders in late December; in particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some one-time unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extenders law. The combined effect was a 20-basis-point reduction in the 2015 effective rate, or about $0.02 per share.","You may recall at this time last year that, given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range. For 2016 with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range.","Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015, as forecast. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.","And finally on the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases; and when you combine those share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1 times our free cash flow from operations for the year.","Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.","Abigail, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Yes. Good afternoon, Phebe and Jason.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good afternoon.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Phebe, maybe this is a good opportunity just since we haven't spoke since the budget deal, and maybe you could just give us your overview how you see that impacting domestically? And also, related to that, are you seeing any changes on the international order front just given what has happened with the oil prices with any of your customers? Thanks, Phebe.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the budget deal provided us funding in line with \u2013 exactly in line with what we anticipated, so no surprises there; and some upside, frankly, in a couple of areas. But that stability is critical and, I think, very helpful as we think through the defense portfolio for the next year or two. So that was, I think, very helpful. But as I said, it was consistent with what we had anticipated. With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase \u2013 and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increase our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid-East.","You know, as we've talked a lot in the past, from my perspective, defense spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worse. So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements. And we work carefully with them to ensure that we can provide them what they need when they want it and terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate. I would also remind you, by the way, that most of our orders in that part of the world are government to government, which provides some stability. So that is a benefit to us as well as we look forward.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. You had talked a little bit about free cash flow not being that robust this year. And you had talked about last \u2013 I guess, in 2015 because of the Aerospace investments. Can you just walk through what kind of expectations and then what changes as you go into 2017 that makes it start to see us return to 100% conversion?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's all three. It's a reversal, an unwinding of all three of the factors that we've talked about impacting 2015 and 2016, but let's take Gulfstream. We're continuing to build demonstration and test aircraft, test aircraft for both the G500 and G600. Our capital deployment \u2013 or our CapEx is largely done at Gulfstream, but that buildup in inventory will continue until we begin to take \u2013 or deliver the G500 and G600. So that will help unwind that buildup of working capital at Gulfstream. NASSCO will have completed its Jones Act ships in 2017. And then we anticipate a number of orders coming into the Marine group that, of course, carry cash. And in Combat Systems, we will begin to get additional cash as we ramp up to full-rate production on a number of our international orders. So 2015, 2016, lighter than we're used to. But 2017, it'll be above; every expectation we have is it'll be above 100% of net income.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Any way to quantify what percentage of net income you're expecting this year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It'd be about similar to last year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Think about cash similar to last year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Phebe, on Gulfstream, can you just talk about what you're expecting actually for the actual number of large cabin deliveries you're expecting in 2016? And then can you talk about what the reducing rate on the G450 and G550, what that's done to shrink or to expand the lead time? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me take those in inverse order. We've been reducing the G450 very immaterially for the last about seven or eight quarters, so in line again with what we saw in demand and what we predicted in demand. And as to be expected, we reduced the G550 production rate in the fourth quarter, again, in line with demand. Our wait times are essentially the same, three to fourth quarters in those lines of business. In 2016, you asked about what are our production and delivery \u2013 what are our delivery targets in our plan. Large cabin about 104, medium cabin 34. That compares to 2015, large cabin of 112 and medium cabin of about \u2013 mid cabin about 35. So down eight large and one medium cabin, with a better mix, I might add. And that's what you would expect, a better mix as we enter this year of transition, more G650s, fewer G450s and G550s.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, Phebe, Jason. I wanted to ask for just a follow-on to David's question just on the pricing environment. Then I had a more technical question on your share authorization. Last year you did this twice and you had one in December and mentioned there might be something coming at the end of Q1. Is twice the norm going forward?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me talk about the pricing environment. We have held our prices very consistently, and to the extent that others are having pricing pressure, it hasn't affected us materially. So I think that's the full and short answer to that question. Jason, you want to...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","... share repurchases.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, the share repurchase authorization, so you're right. We did a total of $20 million authorized last year in two tranches. We got $10 million authorized late in the year by the board. Certainly wouldn't want to get out ahead of them in terms of the plans for the coming year but we'll address that as it comes. And as the opportunistic approach to share repurchase works down that current authorization, we'll see where it goes midway through the year.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But there's no mechanical plan here that continues like this? There's nothing to it? It's just coincidental?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Exactly. It's coincidental. And as we said, as always, more of an opportunistic approach and we'll see where that takes us.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Phebe, the usual question I'll ask would go through. You had much better Gulfstream margin in the fourth quarter than the third even though the revenues were down. Maybe if you could explain a little more what happened there. And then going forward with G650s being up, I would think they probably have the highest margin at this point. So why would the margin deteriorate a little bit in 2016? Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me talk about revenue. As we noted before, we reduced the G550 rate for the fourth quarter. We had less preowned revenue than anticipated and somewhat less than anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue and that was mix driven as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FBO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right?","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Right.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","From the usual suspects. We had mix shift. We had liquidated damages, launch assistant. And by the way, you quite rightly point out we had improved margins in the G650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those aren't what we (30:57) leading you to, guiding you to is \u2013 are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate. But what we are focused on and have been laser focused on and have been telling our investors for some time, we are going to keep earnings flat. And that's what we've signed up for and we see the path forward to clearly do that.","Operator","Thank you.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. On IS&T, Phebe, about a year ago or so, I think you were \u2013 you sounded pleasantly surprised at how well IS&T was holding up, and it has held up quite well while others in some similar businesses have had a lot of issues. The backlog's down a little bit in this quarter. If you look inside that business and look forward and you separate into Mission Systems and GDIT, how do you see those two outlooks going now over the next couple years?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me talk a little bit about the book-to-bill. With the exception of the fourth quarters in 2014 and 2015, our IS&T book-to-bill has been approximately one to one every other quarter in both years. Q4 in those lines of businesses tends to be more of an issue, a timing issue than anything else. And we expect book-to-bill for 2016 about one to one. These are businesses that are performing extremely well and winning more than their fair share based on their ability to increase their operating leverage by decreasing costs, and their performance has been outstanding. So it's more of the same for them going forward. So ruthless dedication to cost cutting, operating performance, must perform on that backlog. And that then quite nicely leads to the kinds of book-to-bill that we've seen in these businesses. So I see that as more goodness to come.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Do you see Mission Systems and GDIT behaving somewhat differently? They have somewhat different drivers.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, they're different margin businesses. Mission Systems tends to be more heavily product oriented in nature, and product tends to carry higher margins. Our IT business is services; services have lower margins. But as I like to tell everybody, they got great cash performance. In fact, by the way, both of those businesses have a great cash performance. And with our services business, terrific return on invested capital. So there's no invested capital.","But think about our information \u2013 our IT services businesses. When they go to market, they go to market in their core, and they are very competitive in their core both through past performance and cost competitiveness. So I like where they're positioned, and that hasn't changed for us. They continue to win and they're a big dog in the barnyard, not to make too many metaphors.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, or I guess good afternoon now. I wanted to follow up on Gulfstream for a second, and on the G650 in particular. Could you comment on where this skyline currently reaches to? And also a little bit on the pre-owned or, I guess, the available for sale G650s that are in the market and at what point do you see that as being more of a threat to production, because there's always going to be a battle of if the like-new starts to approach price points of your aircraft coming off the line? Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me answer that in the inverse order. We have seen and don't anticipate seeing any impact from the planes that are in the used market. It really hasn't impacted us at all, because the guidance of the demand for that airplane has been, and we believe will continue to be, very, very wholesome. Despite taking up our production rates slightly, we are still at first quarter 2018 first available. So that tells you that is a strong, sustainable backlog for a very powerful airplane.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. I want to turn to Marine for a moment, Phebe. There's a number of dynamics going on there. You have a new agreement at Bath. You've got a couple of new opportunities. And then, at the same time, you've been working through the Jones Act backlog. Could you describe a little bit of the working parts there and what might the Navy also do in terms of service going forward?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, yeah, let me talk about all three of those businesses and give you a little bit of color. We have achieved a very significant agreement with our partners, our workforce in Maine at Bath that will allow Bath to be increasingly competitive going forward in all of its competitions. And we're very proud of our workforce there, and we are very optimistic about our ability to compete on a going-forward basis. So I like what I see at Bath.","And by the way, you didn't ask, but on the DDG-1000, the first one is 98% done; so almost out the door. The second one's 84% done; and again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on the first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship, I think, is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we entirely designed and built, so that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for Bath very nice.","At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of Jones Act ships, as you quite rightly point out. There is, we believe, significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy, but there is demand out there. And because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure, they have been very competitive in their Jones Act competitions and won a nice backlog; and we continue to believe we're going to add to that backlog.","Their service business has been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is, what we believe, quite rightly moving to fixed price service contracts, and we know how to work those and we've been working closely with our Navy customers. So we like what we see in service, particularly out west in San Diego; little bit of lightness in the Norfolk area as the Navy re-jiggers some of its porting of some major ships, but we anticipate service to grow reasonably well on the surface ship side, single digit, low-single digit with a nice operating performance. We also anticipate additional submarine service at Electric Boat. Nothing too significant, but, again, right in our sweet spot. And, again, at Electric Boat, it's a story about Virginia and Ohio. Right?","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Yes.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But I (39:10) think a once over of that entire portfolio.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much for the rundown.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, Phebe, Jason.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I didn't know \u2013 just a quick clarification and a question. I didn't know if you mentioned the year-over-year impact from pension in that apples-to-apples comparison. If you could give us that, that'd be helpful as well. And then, just really appreciated the commentary on 2017, 2018, 2019. If you look \u2013 I know you talked about revenues in Marine and IS&T. And as you think about margins there, obviously, you talked about margins being up as part of the vigorous earnings growth in Combat. But when you look at potential for margins in the defense businesses in aggregate, and mainly IS&T and Marine, what's the outlook for those similar to the comments you made for Combat?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me have Jason ask the first part of your question on pension.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. And Carter, if I understand your question, you're talking about the sort of the walk forward on EPS from 2015 to 2016. And really when you think about our pension plans and our accounting for those plans, especially in the defense businesses, that is a muted effect in EPS. So it really just isolated to the commercial pension side which had a negligible effect.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yep.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I haven't calculated it, but it's nothing that would be materially...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Extremely modest positive is what you're saying?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There you go.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let's talk about the businesses. On a going-forward basis, we anticipate the IS&T group to be at around a 10% margin business. That may vary from quarter to quarter, or year to year depending on how much revenue the service business brings in. But for our foreseeable future that's about a 10% business. Combat, we see in the mid-15%, 15.5% pretty steady eddy. We may have, and we do, I believe, have margin expansion opportunity at the platform businesses. But remember, that will be somewhat offset by the short cycle business of OTS which we had terrific margins out of that business after we consolidated two units in 2014.","With all things at defense, some of that goodness needs to go back to our customer, quite appropriately so. So that'll cause some margin compression for them. But from right now what we're planning for, for Combat, steady state 15%, 15.5% margin. We will, of course, strive for higher. And then the Marine group will be a 9.5% to 10% margin business depending on mix. As we've talked about before, performance at shipyards is, well performing shipyards, is all about the mix and we've got a number of mix shift issues which we've kind of articulated. But I think that gives you a sense of how we see our business going forward.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Phebe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, Phebe, thanks so much, and good performance.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","So at Gulfstream I guess two issues. One is if you could give us any help in terms of where the R&D and launch aid is in your plan for 2016? And secondly I guess more importantly, you had a 7% layoff you announced in December. Maybe walk us through if there's any severance impact in the fourth quarter and the types of benefits you expect to realize from that in 2016.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me talk a little bit about the reduction, then I'll turn it over to Jason. We've been talking for the last year or so about this transition period from moving from the G450, G550 to G500 and G600. Well, we're in it now, and quite appropriately you would expect us to size for that. So our head count reductions were all about sizing appropriately for what we see in terms of revenue and our promise to keep margins, well, keep earnings flat year-over-year. So we did some pruning. Headcount reductions were just a part of our cost cutting effort as we improved our operating performance, took a fair amount of overhead out and touch labor. And we'll continue to do so, on a going-forward basis.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So on the R&D question, as you can imagine, the pace of that will sort of follow the cadence of the flight test program. So we expect that to pick up modestly in the next year and a little bit more in 2017 as we continue through that program. But I say modestly immaterially, still well within the range of our normal collar that we would normally expect R&D to flow in.","Your question around the launch of systems payments, they'll continue to flow. I don't have the exact schedule of that, but it'll cause that quarterly amount to be lumpy as it's always been. And we'll report that to you when it gets out of line. But expect, net-net, a modest immaterial growth in R&D next year and then again the following year.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Just totally changing gears to the balance sheet. As you well know, right, the balance sheet's extraordinarily strong. Do you have any thoughts on maybe levering it up a little bit? Or what you think about that? Or what do you think the proper capital structure is for General Dynamics?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I think consistent with the position we've held in the past is levering up really is not something we're interested in, particularly as it relates to our current capital deployment approach of share repurchase and dividends. Incurring debt for the proper long-term strategic opportunity is certainly out there, but that's something that we'll continue to hold as dry powder until that type of opportunity shows up.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Yeah. Thank you.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","And, Abigail, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. To follow up actually from what Ron was asking, does this imply that the acquisition pipeline out there is not particularly attractive in your point of view? And maybe in relation to this, there's a little bit of stickiness going on in fed IT at the moment. Do you think this has any implications for you?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So fed IT, I think what you're seeing is \u2013 what we anticipate is seeing the same players just with new t-shirts on, new brands. In the pipeline, it is what it has been. And I think to Jason's point, it has always been our view that if we found something attractive and very accretive, we would lever up for it. But we haven't been there, and we don't see that as we stand in the moment. I don't think anything has fundamentally changed in the broader portfolio, defense and Aerospace portfolio. Service, a little bit, but that's \u2013 I gave you my view of that.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks, Phebe.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Great.

As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. ","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.","Jay L. Johnson","Thank you, Amy. Welcome back, and good morning.","Amy  Gilliland","Thank you.","Jay L. Johnson","General Dynamics' fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at Gulfstream and across our defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation's completion business blemished an otherwise solid quarter and year. ","Fourth quarter sales and operating earnings were the largest of the year at Gulfstream and at each of our defense businesses. Company sales totaled nearly $9.2 billion and up 6% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by Gulfstream G650 deliveries.","Operating earnings were $950 million for the quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations were $603 million or $1.68 per fully diluted share. For the full year, sales were $32.7 billion, a modest increase over 2010. Operating earnings totaled $3.8 billion, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. ","Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion or $6.94 per fully diluted share, an increase of 2% over last year's EPS result.","Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. For the year, free cash totaled $2.8 billion or 109% of earnings from continuing operations.","Let me address the 2 Jet Aviation charges first, one related to contract losses and the other an impairment of an intangible asset. These charges reflect 2 issues that I have previously highlighted, namely, lingering performance challenges on several narrow-body, wide-body aircraft, and the significant decline in other OEM business jet completions work. ","The contract losses taken this quarter, which depressed group margins by over 400 basis points, resulted primarily from cost growth caused by increased labor hours and late penalties on 3 wide-body and narrow-body aircraft. These legacy aircraft are the most complex custom completions project ever undertaken at Jet Aviation.  Once we've delivered these aircraft, our Jet team will focus on completing the next series of aircraft, which are already benefiting from new management and operating processes.","As a result of trends experienced in the completions business, we conducted a fourth quarter review of long-lived access assets at Jet Aviation and recorded an intangible impairment charge of $111 million. This impairment, which reflects an outlook with substantially fewer business jet and narrow-body, widebody completions than when we acquired Jet Aviation, negatively impacted Aerospace margins by 600 basis points in the quarter. ","These charges are very disappointing, and clearly, not in keeping with General Dynamics' operational track record.  The new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's completions business in 2012, including restructuring operations to lower overhead and headcount; improving the coordination between engineering and operations; and strengthening supply chain management controls.  ","I would point out that the other 3 quarters of Jet's business portfolio continues to perform well. Revenues at Jet's aircraft service facilities around the world were up double digits in 2012 -- 2011, excuse me, and remain well positioned with an established global footprint as emerging market business jet demand takes hold. I said many times that we acquired Jet for their global footprint. As the business jet installed base expands internationally, Jet's facilities will be ever more elemental to our Aerospace growth. ","Now let me talk about the Aerospace group and more specifically, Gulfstream. Gulfstream enjoyed a banner fourth quarter, marked by strong cash generation, healthy order activity and the first 12 green G650 deliveries. These aircraft deliveries drove significant growth in the group's fourth quarter sales. ","Aerospace sales, which totaled $1.9 billion, were up nearly 50% when compared to fourth quarter 2010 and up over 30% sequentially. Operating earnings were $73 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of charges taken at Jet. For the year, Aerospace sales were $6 billion, up 13%, while operating earnings were $729 million. The group's top line growth was driven by the fourth quarter G650 deliveries and improved service activity throughout the year. ","Gulfstream made meaningful progress in product development in the fourth quarter, to include receiving provisional type certification from the FAA for the G650 and from Israel's Civil Aviation Administration for the G280. Both aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA IASA certification and entry into service in the midyear. Our first 12 green G650 deliveries went smoothly, giving us further confidence in the G650's design for manufacturing processes.","Business jet market indicators were positive again in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remained robust, and our service centers enjoyed another good quarter. For the year, our Aerospace service business was up a combined 15%, including Gulfstream's best year ever in service volume. ","Preowned inventory levels for both large- and mid-cabin aircraft continued to show gradual improvement. We took one aircraft in trade in the fourth quarter, and subsequently sold it for a small profit. We had no preowned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a modest profit on just over $75 million in sales on 5 preowned aircraft.","The Gulfstream order book was healthy again in the fourth quarter and exhibited many of the trends we've seen throughout the year. Although orders were placed for each of our aircraft models this quarter, demand remained strongest for our large-cabin offerings. ","Similarly, international customers continued to dominate new orders, although North America enjoyed its strongest quarter of the year, comprising nearly 45% of the order book. Notably, with this strong fourth quarter finish, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders in 2011  since the introduction of the G650 in 2008, causing year-over-year backlog to increase to $17.9 billion.","New aircraft book-to-bill this quarter was one-time on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite strong bookings, backlog decreased from the third quarter due primarily to the large number of green G650s delivered. Also, as expected, G650 defaults were higher than normal this quarter, as customer milestone payments were triggered by provisional type certification. We actually saw fewer defaults than anticipated and still have over 200 G650 aircraft in backlog.  I should also highlight that we continue to maintain an 18- to 24-month backlog for our G450 and 550 aircraft.","At year-end, Gulfstream's backlog consisted of 64% international customers, including 27% in Asia Pacific. The Gulfstream product support organization continued to expand in 2011 to keep pace with our international customer base, including new facilities or additions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore and elsewhere. ","In the fourth quarter, we also announced the opening of a product support office in Hong Kong, and the opening of an office in Beijing, which will enable us to better serve our growing Asia Pacific-based customers.  Fortune 500 and other public companies comprised 34% of year-end backlog, up modestly from 2010, with individuals and private companies comprising the other 2\/3.","In 2012, we plan to deliver just over 100 large-cabin green aircraft, including approximately the same number of G550s and 450s as in 2011 and about 2 dozen G650s. We expect mid-sized green deliveries to be around 10 to 15 aircraft, primarily the G280.  The additional G650 deliveries will drive 15% top line growth in the Aerospace group this year, and margins should be around 15%, driven by improvement at Jet Aviation. ","Next, the defense side of the business. Before discussing the performance and outlook for each of our defense segments, let me comment briefly on our defense outlook. Amidst the backdrop of continued deficit focus and political divide, we are pleased to start the new year with a 2012 defense budget, as this provides some clarity to our 2012 planning process. ","General Dynamics programs were well supported again in this year's budget, including $577 million for Abrams tanks, $723 million for Strykers, $1 billion for WIN-T, and $1.1 billion for JTRS, and full funding for all of our ship and submarine programs. Congressional support for the defense industrial base was solid throughout the 2012 legislative process, particularly as it relates to our tank, Stryker and shipbuilding programs.","However, even with an approved 2012 defense budget, we recognize the potential complications to budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, likelihood of another continuing resolution and the looming shadow of sequestration. As we saw in 2011, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T world, budget officers and program managers are put into positions where they naturally pull back or make awards very cautiously when a continuing resolution is likely.  This year, with the added threat of sequestration, the situation becomes even more unsettled.  If sequestration were to occur as laid out today, it would be very bad for defense and frankly, for our country. While many believe, as do we, that it is unlikely to happen as presently described, no one knows how it will be resolved. ","The DoD has already provided some FY '13 budget details, particularly as they relate to the Budget Control Act defense top line. The Secretary of Defense is scheduled to provide more detail this week, with the service chiefs to follow in the days thereafter. That should give us more insight as to how investment accounts overall, and our programs in particular, will fare. ","Given our incumbency and relevance, we do not expect any significant surprises. The roles and missions study implies that ship, ISR and cyber programs will continue to be priorities in 2013 and beyond, especially as the new Pentagon strategy pivots toward Asia Pacific. Conversely, we would expect to see some uncertainty in the 2013 budget request concerning the final disposition for Stryker and Abrams funding by Congress. ","Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is clearly coming down. Given this backdrop and our lessons learned from the changing defense environment in 2011, my 2012 defense segment guidance is realistic.  We are doing everything in our control to position our defense businesses for the declining budget headwinds, including continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting non-core businesses and headcount reductions. ","These types of actions enabled us to maintain defense earnings in 2011 despite declining sales. As appropriate, we are also adding new businesses to shore up our outlook and improve our competitiveness in faster-growing market channels.","We continue to feel confident about the defense portfolio relevance in this environment -- our defense portfolio relevance in this environment, excuse me. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base, which must be maintained. ","We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy Force Structures, and with fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs capable of addressing today's dynamic threat environment will require continued production and modernization.","Now let's move to Combat Systems. The Combat Systems group delivered a productive fourth quarter, marked by the acquisition of Force Protection and healthy domestic and international order activity. The Force Protection acquisition, which closed in late December, expands Combat Systems' sustainment business, tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio and product development capabilities. ","As partners in delivering thousands of Cougar-variant MRAPs to the Marine Corps, we gained an appreciation for the company's significant research and test capabilities. Our broadened development experience, together with Force Protection's proven product portfolio, better position combat systems to compete for vehicle sustainment and upgrade opportunities in new development programs globally. ","In the fourth quarter, Combat Systems sales were $2.6 billion, while earnings were $388 million, both down 3% when compared to last year. This downslope was in part a function of timing, as several new engineering and development opportunities planned for the year, including the Ground Combat Vehicle moved to the right. Margins were 14.9%, also on par with the year-ago period.","For the year, the group sales were $8.8 billion. This represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume, particularly Abrams and Stryker. International LAV upgrades in Axles for military and commercial OEMs helped to soften the U.S. vehicle decline. ","Cost reduction and productivity improvements enabled Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at $1.3 billion despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.5%, modestly ahead of our expectations, as cost performance improved on several of our core vehicle programs.","Combat Systems enjoyed its largest order quarter in 2 years in the fourth quarter, with sizable awards for U.S., European and FMS vehicle programs. Notable U.S. orders in the quarter included approximately $800 million for Stryker production and sustainment; and $100 million for MRAP upgrades. The group's nearly $1.4 billion in international fourth quarter awards included LAV and tank upgrades for several customers, and another tranche of DURO vehicles for the Swiss government.  ","The quarter's healthy order activity and the addition of Force Protection caused Combat's backlog to expand by $1 billion, a 10% increase from the third quarter. Year-end total potential contract value for Combat was $14.9 billion, including $11.4 billion in backlog and $3.5 billion of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts.","While the way ahead is not entirely clear, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles are undisputed. We believe we will see additional Abrams upgrades and Stryker Double-V Hulls either through new production or upgrades of existing vehicles.","The Combat Systems business will also be extremely competitive in each of the major development programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle, where we are 1 of just 2 teams selected to compete; the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; the amphibious combat vehicle; and the armored multipurpose vehicle. In the event that these programs are impacted by budget decisions, we have a portfolio of proven vehicle solutions to offer.","Combat Systems will continue to provide support and sustainment of vehicles we produce. We have the experience and the infrastructure to expand those services to support a wider array of Army and Marine Corps vehicles. Our successful teaming relationship with the Army's Anniston depot over the last 5 years differentiates General Dynamics from our competitors. ","Additionally, with Force Protection now in our portfolio, we have enhanced our exposure to U.S. and international inventories by several thousand vehicles. The requirement to improve vehicle suspension, protection and power capabilities will create opportunities for us to leverage our experience and help our customers identify ways to affordably reconstitute and modernize.","Our international vehicle business continues to grow. With several billion dollars of orders in backlog, we are at work on LAV and tank production and upgrade programs for a variety of foreign customers. This work helped to mitigate pressure on our U.S. vehicle business volume in 2011 and will continue to do so through 2014. Beyond our ongoing contracts, we're tracking a variety of international competitions, including the TAPV and CCV programs in Canada, and several 8x8 vehicle and tank programs in the Middle East.","Our munitions and weapons systems businesses also face budget pressures over the next few years. However, adjacent and international market opportunities and continued strength in the Axle business should provide some offset. ","For 2012, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales, reflecting declining domestic vehicle funding, somewhat offset by growth in our international vehicle programs and the addition of Force Protection. We expect operating margins in the low- to mid-14% range, consistent with 2011.","Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished the year with another solid quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.8 billion, up 3% over 2010, while operating earnings increased 7% to $190 million. The group's 10.8% margins were 40 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2010. ","Higher Ohio-class replacement volume and the addition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk, stimulated top line growth, while strong T-AKE program performance drove the earnings and margin improvement. For the full year, sales were $6.6 billion, down modestly from 2010, while earnings grew 2.5% to $691 million. ","The sales decline was primarily a timing issue, as several destroyer awards planned for earlier in the year slipped into the third quarter. The group's 10.4% operating margin for the year reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our shipyards and improved performance on the T-AKE and MLP programs throughout 2011.","Marine's year-end backlog totaled $18.5 billion. This enduring backlog includes several awards received in 2011, which position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including 2 additional Zumwalt-class destroyers; DDGs 1001 and 1002; 2 DDG 51 destroyers, part of the Arleigh Burke restart program; 2 mobile landing platform MLP ships; and additional repair work enhanced in part by the NASSCO Norfolk acquisition. ","In 2012, we expect to receive the RFP for the next block of Virginia-class submarines, which should include 9 boats. This contract is scheduled to be awarded in 2013.","For the year ahead, I expect Marine Systems sales to be ever so slightly down, with margins in the low- to mid-10% range. The group's outlook is very stable, with a number of opportunities, including the next block of Virginia-class submarines; the SSBN replacement program; additional DDG 51s; a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers; and new commercial work. ","The value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent roles and missions study, which emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This bodes well for our shipbuilders.","Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion and earnings at $315 million, essentially flat from the year-ago period. Continued strength at our IT service business, bolstered by the addition of Vangent, helped to offset a decline at the group's tactical communications business. Group sales were pressured by the FY '12 continuing resolution, which exacerbated the sluggish award activity felt throughout 2011. ","Margins increased 20 basis points to 10.8%. For the full year, IS&T sales were $11.2 billion, down 3% from 2010, primarily due to lower tactical communications volume. This lower volume was the result of several program cancellations: FCS brigade modernization; IWIN integrated wireless network; and JTRS AMF, just to name 3; and award delays, particularly in shorter-cycle encryption, mobile and ruggedized computing products. Two of our largest sole-source tactical awards in 2011, WIN-T Increment 2 and CHS-4, were delayed by approximately 6 months.","Despite significant market pressures, the group's IT service business continued to deliver organic growth in 2011. This growth, which helped to mitigate the group's sales decline, was primarily due to several large IT infrastructure support projects and success in capturing new business opportunities. IS&T operating earnings were $1.2 billion in 2011, as margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.7%.","Consistent with the group's historical trend, IS&T order activity was lighter in the fourth quarter than the previous 3. For the year, IS&T book to bill was 0.92x, a good result in a year which included 7 months of continuing resolutions. Year-end total potential contract value, which includes backlog, IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, totaled $32 billion, an increase of 28% from 2010.","This healthy opportunity set positions IS&T well for 2012, particularly given the reasonably strong support the group's products received in the 2012 defense budget. For instance, following successful 2011 customer testing, we anticipate receiving FY '12 funded awards for the next low-rate production increment of WIN-T and the first tranche of full-rate orders for our Rifleman Radios. Also, despite the market environment, IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than ever, as our products and services portfolio remains well aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cyber security; enhanced ISR; battlefield communications; and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure. ","IS&T sales will likely be flat in 2012. As suggested earlier in my remarks, this guidance anticipates that the shadow of sequestration and the potential for another fourth quarter continuing resolution continue to prolong and delay awards, effectively pushing sales to the right even more than what we saw in 2011.  Margins should be in the high 9% range, driven by a higher percentage of IT services work, continued slowdown in product volume and the competitive market environment.","The 2012 segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range between $7.10 and $7.20. This guidance is operational. It does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. In terms of capital deployment, we maintained our balanced approach in 2011, and I expect that to persist this year. ","Last year, we deployed $1.4 billion to repurchase 20 million of our shares. Through both share repurchases and dividends, we returned 77% of free cash to shareholders in 2011. We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire 6 businesses that enhanced our Combat, Marine and IS&T portfolios. Our strong cash performance in 2011 and excellent cash outlook for this year afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.","In closing, while no one today can say with certainty what defense spending will look like in 2013 and beyond, we feel our businesses are as well positioned as any. Marines products are at the heart of the Pentagon's Asia Pacific focus, while IS&T, cyber, ISR and intelligence mission-support capabilities remain well aligned with customer requirements. ","Combat's vehicle programs will be challenged. However, strong international sales will help to defray budget headwinds. And we continue to believe that enhancements and upgrades to our vehicle programs offer an attractive lower risk alternative to our customers as they recapitalize the force following a decade of war. ","Outside of defense, our Aerospace group will serve as the company's primary growth engine over the next several years, as G650 deliveries ramp and the international sales increase.  Clearly, General Dynamics' diverse portfolio remains a distinguishing asset.","With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?","L. Hugh Redd","Thank you, Jay, and good morning. I'd like to cover a few additional financial items before the question-and-answer period. ","First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter and $141 million for the full year. These amounts were in line with our expectations.  For 2012, we expect net interest expense between $155 million and $160 million, reflecting the full year impact of the $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes we issued in 2011. As you may recall, in July, we issued $1.5 billion just prior to the maturity of notes in the amount of $750 million. ","Corporate expense was $77 million for 2011, and we expect corporate expense to approximate $80 million again in 2012. The effective tax rate was 33% -- excuse me, 33.8% for the quarter and 31.4% for the full year. And the fourth quarter was higher than the prior quarters and higher than we anticipated due to less European income than we had expected. ","That, of course, was a result of the performance in our Swiss-based completions business. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32%, rising slightly over the 2011 rate, but due in large measure to the current lack of an extension of the R&D tax credit in the provisions of the tax code. ","Finally, cash contributions to our pension plans for 2012 are expected to be approximately $500 million, occurring primarily in the second half of the year. ","Amy, that concludes my remarks.","Amy  Gilliland","Thanks, Hugh. I'd like to highlight that a summary of the guidance provided this morning is now posted on our website as supporting materials in the webcast link. ","[Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jay, I'm hoping you can give us a little color under the surface in some of the guidance that you provided, particularly in Combat and IS&T. And just to start with Combat, the underlying organic decline there, about 10%, can you give us a little bit more clarity on programs that constitute that shortfall or that decline? And as you look out further, are those programs stabilizing? Or are they continuing to retreat and then you'd backfill them with the international growth elsewhere?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, as I mentioned, I mean, we're seeing U.S. decline that we offset with the international, as you just said and I said in my remarks. But I mean, it's a combination of Stryker and Abrams, primarily. And if you look out past 2013, you don't see a lot. But if you looked at a year ago, what we had in 2012, you didn't see a lot either, and we ended up being very well supported. So this is a constant work in progress between us, the customer and the Congress, and I would anticipate that to continue. So there will be some U.S. vehicle decline. We see that quite clearly. But don't forget, those programs are both elemental to the United States Army, even as they reshape themselves. So we'll use the international sales to help offset that, but we'll still do a great deal of business in both those domestic programs. And now we've got Force Protection in there to help us on both the product and sustainment piece for the vehicle business.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Was it roughly split, the $1 billion decline, organically between Stryker and Abrams? Or is it favoring more one over the other?","Jay L. Johnson","No, I think it was more Stryker, actually.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay, just to follow up on that, a lot of moving pieces. Could you maybe give us a number, organically how much you see the entire defense side of the business down in 2012?","Jay L. Johnson","Probably 1% or 2% would be my -- off the top of my head, offset by the Aerospace growth.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And as a quick follow-up, you mentioned North America for Gulfstream's strongest quarter in a while there. What do you think's driving that at this point? And do you think what you're seeing is sustainable?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, first of all, the Gulfstream order book is healthy across the board. I mean, we're very pleased, particularly, as I mentioned, in the large-cabin. That's a consistent message I've been delivering, but it's backed up by the backlog in the order book. We see very healthy order activity, particularly in the large-cabin offerings. I would say the United -- North American market returning is a good sign. It's still outpaced by the international space. But we're very encouraged to see the North American market activity picking up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jay, on the G650, could you update us on how things are going here? You got the provisional cert. You delivered the aircraft. You had said, I think, that the margins on the first aircraft would be in line with the sector average of around 15%. So did that actually transpire in the quarter? And then, as we look forward, how do you feel about getting the complete cert? How -- the rate ramp-up, the completions,  how's all that coming along?","Jay L. Johnson","Okay. Joe, first of all, I'm very pleased with the 650 program. We're very excited about it. The aircraft is performing beautifully, and the sales book is still very active, even with over 200 in the backlog. So that's all good. We are on track, as I mentioned in my remarks, and I think the way I said -- the words I used were \"in the midyear.\" We're still looking at about late second quarter, thereabouts. It's paced, quite honestly, by the working down of the test points in collaboration and with the FAA. All on track. All looking real strong right now. The airplanes, as I said, are performing beautifully. The margins were consistent with what I've been saying, Joe. They are better than the group average but not as strong, as you would expect, as the in-production large-cabin aircraft. That, too, will change, as I've said before, and it will ramp up beautifully. I'm just not-- I'm not ready to wick that up verbally yet. But everything we see in the production side, everything we see in Savannah is coming along very handsomely with the 650. So the rate ramp-up that you asked about, again, I'm going to hold to what I've said before. The production, we're going to add about 2 dozen or so green deliveries a year. Did I say -- yes. 10 to 15 a year is what I'm -- 10-15 a year green deliveries. But my complete deliveries, I'm sticking with 17, 33 and 33 for right now, with every expectation that we'll exceed that. I'm just not ready to go there yet.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just finally the completion process, that has been a bottleneck in the past on new aircraft types. How are things going? And how do you feel about getting those first dozen aircraft that you've taken payment on, in terms of green deliveries, into customers' hands?","Jay L. Johnson","We feel very good about it. I think it's proceeding just very well, actually. We're anxious to get them to the customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Perlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the, marine segment? I would've thought that, I guess, with the delay on the DDG 1000, as that starts to come in that you'd actually have a worse mix. And it sounds like if I just look at this fourth quarter, as well as your outlook into next year, it would seem like you're not seeing any sort of an adverse margin mix in Marine.","Jay L. Johnson","Well, I mean,  we're clearly still benefiting from the superb performance on the T-AKE program. And that keeps it up. But honestly, even as that matures out and completes at the end of this year, I do not expect to see a drastic margin reduction at all. And I've been very consistent in that. This is a 9%- to 10%-margin business with these 3 superb shipyards. And I say that publicly and then charge the shipyard presidents to beat it.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But it's 9% to 10%, but you're guiding to above 10%. So should I say that, or think that's the T-AKE?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, exactly. Yes, indeed, yes. And as I said, that will complete at the end of this year, Sam.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jay, question on Combat. I just want to get a clarification. Can you tell us what the percentage of international sales was for Combat in 2011 and what that looks like in 2012?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes, Heidi. It's about low 30s in 2011, and I'd see it going up probably a couple of percent or so in 2012, and therefore continuing that kind of a ramp out for the next -- well, with clarity through 2014 to 2015.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And on the Jet Aviation, at your September conference you talked about the issues at Basel and highlighted Jet as a turnaround story in the second half of '12. Can you give us, sort of fold in the charges we're seeing today, relative to those comments? What changed and prompted this charge? Did things get worse?","Jay L. Johnson","I think the way I would-- the best way for me to say it, Heidi -- and I've described it, as you point out, kind of throughout the year. But when we put the new management team in place, okay, just after the midyear and Dan Claire and his team settled in, we brought in some other subject-matter experts from across the businesses here at General Dynamics and particularly at Gulfstream, with the sightline to get clarity and definition, if you will -- more granularity on what we were feeling and seeing. They did exactly that. And as we brought ourselves through the second half of the year, we came to a point in the fourth quarter where the magnitude became very clearly defined for us. And therefore, we realized the operating earning impact, which then triggers an impairment review of the long-lived assets. And so you have it, $78 million of one, $111 million of the other. And I also mentioned in my remarks that most of this tied to the legacy aircraft, and the 3 legacy aircraft in particular; and somewhat to the OEM business mix change, if you will, from the other OEMs, which has impacted us. Those 3 legacy aircraft will be delivered here within -- one of them within a matter of a couple of, few weeks and the others -- by the midyear, I should think they'll all be gone, delivered to customers, with very happy customers in terms of the quality of the work. But I would also say that the charges that were taken capture the costs that we have incurred thus far, and those we project for the completion of those 3 legacy aircraft. I think it's important to put that out there. So we've got the right leadership in place; the management team is firmly in control; the processes that were causing us problem with throughput have been, in large measure, really well defined, clarified. And we're running smoothly with a workforce that is pulling together in the ways that they need to. So I think we're finding ourselves in 2012 in a place of much better improvement at Jet completions, and we're anxious to see that reality unfold throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess, 2 issues at Aerospace. First, if you can update us on the status of the G280, when that should be certified. And secondly, if you could give us the number of the dollars you had of forfeiture gains in the final quarter and some color on what you look for, for 2012.","Jay L. Johnson","Okay, Cai. The 280 cert timeline, I mentioned in my remarks, we got CAI, the Israeli certification provisional -- full cert, sorry. And so now we're working with the FAA to get provisional type certification here in the U.S. That's ongoing right now and proceeding. There's no issues here. It's just marching down the timeline. I believe, based on that, some of the software issues we'd talked about before in terms of what you need to get final certification, type certification, I would expect that to be second quarter -- midyear, as I said, entry into service. But as far as the aircraft itself, the aircraft itself is performing very well. And there is great customer interest. So I think that captures most of the 280. Let me think. Yes, that's probably enough on the 280. But we're on track for certain delivery by the midyear. The dollar forfeiture, the forfeitures, the LD is really a function of getting liquidated damages from the defaults that we experienced, which were higher than they would normally be. We knew that would probably be the case. It was the case, yet it was less than we expected, which sounds like I'm talking around a circle. But at any rate, we got substantially fewer than that in the forecast for 2012. And I think that's probably enough to say right there.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us a number?","Jay L. Johnson","No, I won't give you the number. But let's just say it was probably at least half of the entire year's amount in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up, I think it was on David's question from earlier. You mentioned you're seeing some activity pick up a little bit more in North America. Are you seeing any of that in the mid-sized aircraft? I mean, what's -- If you could give some commentary on what you're seeing in the mid-sized aircraft, because that's clearly been a softer spot, right?","Jay L. Johnson","Yes. Honestly, Ron, it's still a soft spot. I think that's a fair way to say it. We are seeing activity, as I've said, I think, in the last several quarters  in the mid-cabin. We've got activity in the 280, but it's still a very -- there's a lot of inventory out there still to absorb is probably a fair way to say it. So it's clearly still a very bifurcated market with, I would say, very strong activity in the large-cabin and modest to -- but active at a lower level, activity in the mid-cabin.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, not big of a [ph]follow-on to the large-cabin, because it was very active in the large-cabin. I think at one point you guys said that maybe full production on the 650 would be like 40 a year. Have you questioned that to maybe go higher, to maybe 50 a year or 60 a year? I mean, is that -- are those kind of program assumptions being investigated?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, let's just say with 200 in the backlog in the purpose-built facility that you've seen and the way these airplanes are coming together and the excitement that surrounds all of that, we're always looking at opportunities to increase production as rapidly as we can smartly do it. And that's really the operative, and that's why you won't have me getting very aggressive on the number -- as aggressive as perhaps you would like or the airplane deserves. But in time, we'll be there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jay, Hugh and Amy. I wondered if you might talk briefly to aircraft development. I mean, the company has always had a focus on a kind of regular cadence of product updates and introductions. And with the 650 and the 280 entering into service later this year, you're working on some stuff. What should we think be thinking about when we hear about new product introductions? What kind of impacts should those have on, or are they having in, your plan on the 2012 margin outlook within Aerospace?","Jay L. Johnson","I don't think that, that's -- the R&D investments, as I've -- we've said for years around here, is a constant investment and whether the top line is going up or down. We've been through that over the past few years. I would say that the R&D investment this year was higher than kind of normal for us, a full 3.4%, I think something like that. But we target 2% to 2.5% and then deviate from that as circumstance and development requirements dictate. But we're -- suffice it to say, we're in product development all the time. And you know the cycle of our airplanes, nominally a 15-year cycle. So we're either looking to enhance, upgrade or perhaps replace airplanes in due course. The 650, as you well know, isn't replacing anything. It's defining its own spot at the top of the market. The 280's coming in for the 200. That transition's going well, and the rest of it will be done in due course. But we're very pleased with the product line we have right now, and by the order activity that I described earlier. I would say, so is the customer.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just to follow up to that briefly. Presumably, with the growth in the 650, the R&D investment would be declining as a percentage of sales, but is it declining in absolute dollar terms?","Jay L. Johnson","No. No, it's not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jay, I just wondered if we can have a comment from you on cash deployment and whether your thinking has evolved on whether it might be more effective to increase your dividend as a proportion of the cash payout versus buybacks or acquisitions.","Jay L. Johnson","Well, I mean, as you've heard me say many times, we do believe in a balanced capital deployment philosophy here. But specifically to your point, Rob, on the dividend, we've been very proud to increase our dividend for the last 14 years. We gave it a 12% increase last year. We deal with that and have that on the agenda for our meeting, our board meeting on the first week of March. And rest assured, we will have a very thorough discussion of that, and we'll see where the board goes. But I would anticipate dividend activity to come out of that. Beyond that, I'd certainly -- it'd be inappropriate for me to comment.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And maybe just as a follow-up to that, with regard to other cash deployment and acquisitions. How do you see the M&A market as it stands today, particularly with regard to pricing in the defense area?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, I think -- I mean, I think there will be opportunities to acquire defense properties at good value, going forward. I'm not sure we are there right now. But as this market tightens, I believe that there'll be defense space opportunities. And having a lot of cash in your rucksack, as we do, gives us the opportunity to take advantage of some of that, as we did with Force Protection, whereby we got a good strategic asset at a very fair price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Jay, I guess just a follow-up to the acquisition question. I guess the backdrop that you painted regarding defense and the cautiousness and the uncertainty regarding sequestration, how do you really approach having any kind of comfort level regarding M&A on the defense side?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, I think -- again, I mean, you have to look at your criteria for acquisition and be very disciplined in how you analyze, assess and actually then act on the potential acquisition. Does it enhance your portfolio? Does it give you a fast current? Does it give you a return on your investment? And that will be perhaps more challenging as this environment tightens, or perhaps it will become even more clear that this is an obvious go or a no-go. So I think, look, it comes down to the discipline by which you execute these acquisitions. And we have a very good internal process for it. We risk-adjust everything we do, based on the type of business it is. So I feel like we've got the rigor we need to fairly assess what's out there and make good judgments on whether it makes sense to acquire or not. But having said all of that, I'll go back to where I was a minute ago, that I believe there will be acquisition opportunities going forward in the defense space -- if for nothing else, just as a result of the tightening of the defense market.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. And Jay, just as a follow-up to that, how do you weigh that against the -- maybe commercial manufacturing opportunities, just given your history and exposure to commercial markets with Gulfstream?","Jay L. Johnson","We wouldn't restrict our scan pattern to one or the other. We look at them all.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a clarification on the G650, can you remind us how many planes you could produce on an annualized basis with your current installed capacity?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, I don't think -- there have been numbers out there. They haven't come from us. But let's just say that the 650 production will be gauged by the purpose-built facility in which it's being constructed and our ability to put airplanes through there -- which, if you look at what we're doing now versus when we started, it was good when we started. It's really good now. It's only going to get better. So once we get the supply chain flow, the vendor flow, which is coming nicely, you're going to see very, very strong production levels at G650. But as I said earlier today, I'm not ready to give you numbers outside of what I've already committed to.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up question on the 650 and just the competitive environment that's out there today. If a customer, a new customer, were to approach you today, when could you deliver the plane to them? And if it's in the same timeframe of when they could go and get a plane from a competitor, doesn't there seem to be a pretty strong incentive for you to speed up the production rate so that you can get those planes to the customers sooner and perhaps create that as a point of differentiation from a competitive perspective?","Jay L. Johnson","Well, Jason, the way I look at it is if you got 200 airplanes in the backlog, you want to get them to the customers as soon as you can do it. But when you're dealing with the premier brand and the premier aircraft that's going to be out there very shortly, you want to make sure it's done correctly and that the customer has complete satisfaction when the product is received. Therefore, you don't want to over-accelerate yourself -- as I say, \"overdrive your headlights.\" We're not overdriving our headlights. The production is very, very measured and very solid, and we'll wick it up when it makes sense to do so. And when we hit steady-state production in the supply chain, everything's feathered in and flowing beautifully, then we'll wick up the production. But right now, the answer to your question is you'd get an airplane in 2017. That's how big that backlog is. And we'll be producing more every year as we go forward and -- until we hit a steady-state backlog. But we're very bullish on the 650 and so is our customer base, on a global scale.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Amy Gilliland for closing remarks.","Amy  Gilliland","Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3748. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. All parties may now disconnect.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.56 billion and net earnings of $806 million. We reported EPS at $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.09 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $369 million or 4%. This is as reported, but organic growth was higher after taking into account the effect of divestitures at GDIT and the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. Remember that divestitures at GDIT provided some of more than $250 million per quarter in revenue.","Net earnings of $806 million were up $20 million or 2.5% on a modest improvement of operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. Sequentially, revenue was up $294 million or 3.2% and operating earnings were up $76 million or 7.5% on higher operating margins. With respect to consensus, revenue in the quarter was about $200 million more and the operating margin rate was 10 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side. In short, $0.08 of the $0.09 beat was provided by stronger operating earnings.","Let me turn very briefly to the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Revenue was up $2.1 billion or 12.5% against the first half of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. In other words, CSRA revenue was not reflected in the first quarter's results last year.","On the other hand, operating earnings were up only $8 million, burdened by the amortization related to the CSRA acquisition. EPS was $0.06 better. In short, we had a very good second quarter, good sequential improvement, and a good first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal operating plan and external expectations. So, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then ask Jason for some comments before I give you some insight into our outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year.","First Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.14 billion and operating earnings of $331 million were $241 million higher and $55 million lower, respectively. Both numbers were consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin was down 490 basis points as anticipated.","Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earning and -- earnings and operating margins. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a banner quarter in the second quarter of last year with 20.4% operating margins against 15.5% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. No G500s were in the second quarter 2018 results. More importantly the second quarter of 2018 had an unusually large assistant payments from the supplier, It resulted in higher year-over-year R&D expense. These two items were the significant difference between the quarters.","Looking at things sequentially, revenue was down $104 million but operating earnings were up $3 million on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. We enjoyed good order activity in the quarter. The dollar based book-to-bill was one-to-one. This brings the book-to-bill to 1.2 to 1 for the first half. The numbers for Gulfstream alone were somewhat higher. We have had very good operating performance for two -- order performance for two years now. As you know the G500 was certified on July 20, 2018 and we have delivered 21 of them to customers and one to ourselves as demonstrated through the end of the second quarter.","The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. This now paves the way for G600 pilot training and deliveries commencing in early August. This will help both revenue and earnings in the second half and do much to reduce the operating working capital buildup related to producing the early G600s. Finally, EASA validation for the G500 is planned for Q3 and for the G600 in Q4.","Let's now turn to the Defense side of the house. Combat Systems had a good quarter as relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.66 billion was up $125 million over the second quarter last year or 8.1%. Similarly operating earnings of $242 million were up $6 million or 2.5% over the second quarter 2018. I should remind everyone that the second quarter of 2018 represented an 8.5% improvement in revenue over second quarter of 2017 and a 5% increase in operating earnings. In short, we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for the last three years.","On a sequential basis the story is similar. Revenue was up $23 million and operating earnings were up $36 million. For the first half, revenue was up $321 million or 10.8% against the first half of 2018. However, operating earnings were down $12 million with a one-time settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter more than accounting for the year-over-year decline. However, as my outlook for March will indicate, we expect to catch up in the second half.","Our U.S. based programs continue to perform well with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolio. In the aggregate our U.S. government volume accounted for 57% of revenue in the first half as compared with 48% in the first half of 2018. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the upcoming years is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth.","Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. Ajax program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live fire testing has been successful and we expect to enter reliability testing in Q3 of this year. Backlog in this segment is lumpy and the second quarter is no exception. Major orders for this fiscal year were captured in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a consequence, we have a very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvements. We are in the right direction at Combat. It has a very nice growth story.","With respect to the Marine Group, revenue of $2.33 billion was $157 million or 7.2% higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up only $2 million against the year ago quarter on a 50 basis points traction in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $267 million and operating earnings were up $17 million, 13% and 9.4%, respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.38 billion was up $181 million or 4.3% against the first half of 2018. Operating earnings were down $2 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin rate.","Work on our submarine programs of Virginia-class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for Block V. We expect the 10 Block V contract to be awarded later this year. It will result in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 ship and the DDG-51 start ships are behind us with nice performance on DDG-1001 and 1002 on the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51s in backlog with very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog.","Finally, revenue with NASSCO for the quarter and year-to-date was up due to higher volumes related to the TAO Lewis class oilers program. And our Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.28 billion in the quarter, an increase of $130 million or 11.3% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $162 million were up $9 million against the second quarter last year. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $119 million and earnings were up $14 million.","On a year-to-date basis Mission Systems revenue was up $190 million or 8.5%. First half earnings were up $11 million against the first half last year. Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The first half of 2019, the book-to-bill was slightly below one times, we expect that to remedy in the second half. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.16 billion in the second quarter, down $284 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment through the course of last year as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. However, operating earnings were only $2 million, down as a result of improved margin rate.","On a sequential basis, results were also quite solid. Revenue was essentially stable at $2.2 billion for each quarter. Operating profits were also quite similar with 2Q at $154 million versus $156 million in Q1. We are experiencing good program mix and synergies. Our industry leading EBITDA was 12.4% in the quarter matching Q1's results. Our integration of CSRA into GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team both -- from both businesses gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goals.","To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter we had orders of $2.67 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2 to 1. For the first half our book-to-bill is also 1.2 to 1. On a trailing 12-months basis book-to-bill also tops one-time. Our total backlog of $8.85 billion is up 5% after excluding the backlog related to divested businesses.","So in summary, we have delivered solid operating results across the business. The comparisons quarter-over-quarter, sequentially and year-to-date are all fulsome. I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year.","Jason Aiken","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $119 million versus $103 million in the second quarter of 2018. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments related to one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. At this point we expect the interest expense for 2019 to be approximately $460 million. Our cash from operations of $291 million in the quarter was also impacted by these payment delays. As we've discussed previously this is a timing item.","With respect to the outstanding receivable balance, we were recently told by the customer that we will receive considerable funding next month. We continue to expect to resolve the balance of the arrears by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion will be well in excess of 100% of net income. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $181 million in the quarter or approximately 2% of revenues. Assuming receipt of the outstanding payments I just noted consistent with the timing I described, we still expect our capital expenditures to reach approximately 3% of revenues for the year, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, bringing the rate for the first half to 18.3% consistent with our expectations for the full year.","In the quarter, we paid $295 million in dividends and we spent approximately $100 million on the repurchase of 575,000 of our shares. That brings the total for the first half to 1.1 million shares for $184 million. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercised employee stock options. Otherwise we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $702 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $13.2 billion. We expect to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year and our first tranche of fixed and floating rate notes matures in the second quarter of next year.","I'll wrap up with a few points of color on the backlog and our order activity in the quarter. We had another solid quarter with respect to orders. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $67.7 billion. That's up 2% over this time a year ago and the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $102 billion, up 3% over a year ago. As Phebe mentioned, GDIT posted a particularly strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.24 times and I'll remind you that, that does not include over $2.5 billion in IDIQ awards in the quarter which as you know we don't include in backlog or our book-to-bill calculations.","And the last item I'll note is the ongoing impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the backlog of Combat Systems which has experienced a $250 million reduction in backlog in the first six months of the year due to this issue.","With that I'll turn it back over to Phebe.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks Jason. So, turning to our outlook for the year. Let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance.","For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from 2018; operating earnings around $1.5 billion; and an operating margin around 15.5%. We now expect revenue of $9.95 billion with earnings of $1.525 billion with an operating margin of 15.3%. The increased revenue comes largely from increased preowned sales and modest mix shift. Earnings will be up on improved operating performance, but the margin rate will be diluted by preowned aircraft sales. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, up $260 million to $360 million from 2018 with operating earnings in the range of $965 million to $975 million. We now expect revenue of $6.8 billion and operating earnings of approximately $1 billion. The more revenues drives $25 million to $35 million and more operating earnings.","For the Marine Group, we've previously guided to our revenue of $9 billion, margins of around 8.5%, and operating earnings of $770 million. We see no reason to change that guidance, although my bias would be very nominally lower. For Mission Systems, we've previously provided an outlook for this year of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion with margins in the mid to high 13% range. This implied an operating earnings of around $660 million. We now anticipate revenue of $5 billion, operating earnings around $690 million, with operating margins of around 13.8%.","For Information Technology, we guided to revenue of $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 7.5%. We now expect revenue of $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $630 million, with an operating margin of 7.4%, 10 basis points lower. So all of this sums to revenues for General Dynamics of about $39.2 billion and operating earnings of around $4.6 billion. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have both higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $11.60 to $11.70 to a range of $11.85 to $11.90. As for the quarterly progression, it appears to us that the third quarter will be $0.30 better than the second quarter.","Howard, we can now take some questions.","Howard Rubel","Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up. So, that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Phebe the Aerospace division, one of your peers noted that their customers took a bit of a strike in May and June with concerns over the economy and tariffs and I was wondering if you saw anything like that at Gulfstream?","Phebe Novakovic","No.","Robert Stallard","That was pretty straightforward.","Phebe Novakovic","Look we have continued to have nice order activity. Our pipeline remains robust. As I think I have explained to many of you before, you need to look at the business aviation market, not only by cabin size but really by OEM because our experience in the marketplace is very different from others. So we continue to have good order activity throughout each of the months in the quarter.","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein","Yeah, good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Ron.","Ronald Epstein","Just to follow on to Rob's question. I mean, can you kind of walk through the demand environment you're seeing across the different products you have at Gulfstream 650, 600, 500, 280?","Phebe Novakovic","Sure. So the 650 continues to have very solid demand. I think by the end of this quarter we had 370 in service. It continues to have performance characteristics unmatched by anyone else any other aircraft and it continues to enjoy some very nice solid demand. The 600 has had very good demand. We suspect as we saw that the 500 when we start delivering these airplanes that is the catalyst for incremental demand increases and I have every confidence that that will also increase. 500 continues nicely and the 280 has had good sales but a little bit more episodic that end of the market tends to be that way. But on our big key platforms, airplanes, we\u2019ve continued to have good activity.","Ronald Epstein","And then as a follow-on question, have you seen any blowback in the Chinese market regarding the potential sale of Abrams to Taiwan? Because there were some stuff in the Chinese press about it. I'm not sure if it's just kind of press noise or if there's some reality there?","Phebe Novakovic","As far as I know, no tank sales have actually occurred. But let me remind everyone how this works. This is an FMS case or any FMS case. The U.S. Army buys our tanks and sells them to other foreign nations in this case potentially Taiwan. I'd say that that we've had fairly muted demand in that market for a while now, and I suspect that tariffs have had some dampening effect but the pipeline is increasingly active and we've been quite comfortable on where we are.","Ronald Epstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, David.","David Strauss","Hey. Phebe, so on the G500 it looks like deliveries in the quarter based on the 21 that you said have been delivered so far. It looks like deliveries were pretty light in the quarter on G500. Maybe I expected the margin to be better because of that. Can you just talk about that and if you\u2019re through the first block that's below margin G500 deliveries at this point?","Phebe Novakovic","So, we had a bit of catch-up in Q1 right after the -- after the 2018 certification. And frankly this is simply a timing issue and we are continuing to come down our learning curves. Our margin performance is better on each and every airplane that comes down -- and down our line. So, this is simply in the moment a timing issue that we had a bit of a backlog in Q1 and we're through that and we're entering into really steady state.","David Strauss","Okay. And then for my follow-up, on GDIT, it looks like based on your updated guidance, you're still expecting organically ex the divestitures relatively flat in the second half of the year. When do we start to see this strong booking rate that you've highlighted come through in terms of actual organic growth of that business? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","By 2020, as we said before this is in a transition year for us and a positioning for growth year and all of the indicators of growth are there. So, we are pretty confident that next year is going to realize some of those that increased backlog.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Hello, thanks very much and good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Morning.","Seth Seifman","I just want to ask a little bit about the cadence of EPS not that it matters that much, I mean the guidance is out, but just in terms of what you had thought in January has kind of a very heavy fourth quarter and it seems like the EPS that had been in the second half cadence back in January, did some of that show up in the first half?","Phebe Novakovic","Somewhat, but our guidance is really -- so you think about it. The real story undergirding the update in the guidance is we've got more revenue with similar margin performance leading to higher earnings.","So, when we give you our update mid-year, we guided the result of careful ops reviews and we have very considered guidance that looks at all -- and considers all the risk and opportunities and we tend to narrow our range and have a certain amount of precision, but I'd say the overarching story is more revenue higher earnings.","Seth Seifman","Okay, great. And just in Combat, in terms of if there were kind of specific platforms that drove the increase in the guide and, kind of, was there a meaningful amount of FX that you had to offset on the P&L just to be able to raise the guide by that $30 million?","Phebe Novakovic","Not on the P&L with respect to FX. This is simply continuing to come down our learning curves on the domestic programs that we now have and are increasing and then it's the velocity of the domestic program vehicles as we increase our manufacturing capacity. So that's really the undergirding. It's all a story about domestic right now in the U.S. Army.","Seth Seifman","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning, everyone. ","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Jason on the free cash flow, I was wondering if it's maybe kind of worthwhile to bridge from this year to next year just on the bigger pieces just because I think I heard you say the Canadian labs payments coming in the back half of this year take you to 100% free cash to net income conversion this year, so it would imply still below 100% conversion without those payments assuming -- I know CapEx is still albeit, I'm assuming there's other working capital happen. So can we kind of -- can you help us bridge 2019 to 2020? Or is it actually just as simple as it starts clipping 100% conversion pretty clean beyond this year?","Jason Aiken","Yeah, I think if you isolate to catching up on the arrears on the international program this year, we had previously indicated and still are of the position that this year and frankly the years looking forward are in the 95 -- 90%, 95%, 100% conversion range on a pretty steady basis, fluctuating in that range based on CapEx investments and things like that.","So really this one timing item and the resolution of that item is what causes the anomaly, it caused the anomaly last year. And I think to put a little bit more precision on the outlook for this year is if we get fully caught up this year, we would expect to be nicely in excess of 100%. So I think that may be reconciles a little bit of the math you were thinking about. But to your point beyond this year we're really -- we expect to be consistently in the range of 90% to 100% conversion year-on-year subject to some fluctuations with CapEx and other investments like that.","Noah Poponak","Got it. And then Phebe just going back to Gulfstream, can you speak to what pricing has been like in your recent order activity, better, worse or the same and what that means for margin improvement in the business going forward?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, as you can imagine, we're very sensitive about discussing pricing, but you can well imagine that we continue to enjoy the pricing that we've seen recently in our business and on each of our platforms.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yeah thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi.","Jason Aiken","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Phebe on GDIT, it sounds \u2013 it\u2019s great, it sounds like the integration is tracking ahead of your planning and given that we're seeing the 1.2 book-to-bill you saw this quarter, do you characterize this as kind of -- you're picking up share gains? Or is it just the environment with all the spending? Just maybe some color on what you're seeing there? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","So for those of you who have known us for a while, we never track share. That can be a fool\u2019s errand. You can have an awful lot of share and go broke. So what we're really looking for is how we have built our pipeline; our win rates, which since the acquisition have been about 75 -- 74% to 75% on recompetes about 90% very strong at least 1:1 book-to-bill since the acquisition and we've been building -- we've been building that backlog with programs that we think we can execute quite effectively and quite efficiently.","Let's talk a little bit about what GDIT is. You know, this is a people business and the way you attract people is by establishing a superior culture with very clear career development opportunities and some very interesting work. We have done quite well on that side in my mind and that I think undergirds this really quite impressive performance that this management team has exhibited since the acquisition.","And again, just to give you a size and scope and complexity of this business, you know, on the first half we submitted almost $24 billion in proposals and that was more than the entire submittals in 2018. And for the remainder of the year and the second half we're looking at about $27 billion proposals. We submitted about 350 proposals just in terms of numerically in the second quarter and then -- and about 560 -- or 650 in the first half. So that tells you that what you need to undergird that kind of execution in proposals and velocity in submittals. And the win -- and the resultant win rate you need a very, very strong management team undergirded by the culture and the people that I've just talked about. And I'm very pleased with where we are right now. We are doing very well with GDIT. ","Peter Arment","Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Phebe.","Operator","And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So Phebe, could you give us some color in terms of the lead times at Gulfstream particularly for the G650 and 280? ","Phebe Novakovic","So as we've been transitioning to new aircraft we're no longer following individual plane lead times. But let me tell you all of our wait times are comfortably within the range of 1 year to 18 months and that's across our portfolio. So I'm good with that. I think that's the way you think about it and we have continued to perform quite nicely and hit our -- hit comfortable lead times in each of our legacy airplanes as well as our new ones. So we're really just managing to the orders and the demand. And we did well I think.","Cai Von Rumohr","Okay. Terrific. Great. Thank you. And then at GDIT you've given us the bid submits. Can you tell us at mid-year how much of -- what's the number for bids awaiting decision over the remainder of the year? And maybe give us some color some of the potential pursuits like GSMO and next gen?","Phebe Novakovic","So I don't actually know the timing and award decisions, given all the input that is really idiosyncratic to the individual customer, but I think one of the reasons I wanted to share with you the velocity of contracts and the enormity of the velocity of proposals and the enormity of the proposals, to give you a sense that we do not track and I don't think about this business in terms of any particular pursuits.","And many of the pursuits you happen to mention are in our competitive space, so we\u2019re certainly not going to talk about that. But I think that both the size and velocity of the submissions give you a real sense of this is a big business with a lot of moving parts. And frankly I don't worry about any one particular program.","Cai Von Rumohr","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Please go ahead.","Phebe Novakovic","Myles?","Operator","Hello, Myles, your line is open.","Myles Walton","Sorry about that. Good morning. Jason I was wondering if you could first maybe clarify on the payment you expected next month or just give a rough size of the burden at hand you have there. Would you get to full conversion for the year if that one came through?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, I think -- listen these are very -- I think we said all we're going to say about where we are right now on that program. As you can well imagine these are sensitive tripartite conversations and we've told you where, we're making nice progress and let's just leave it at that.","Myles Walton","Okay. Maybe a follow-up then.","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, go ahead.","Myles Walton","The Marine Group, Phebe, you mentioned on the Marine Group that you weren\u2019t changing the guidance that your bias was nominally lower, I just wanted to clarify was that lower on the margin or on the topline?","Phebe Novakovic","I think I said very -- nominally lower. So, listen I am in a big business that has a number of moving parts. I'm very sensitive particularly when we have new starts and we have a number of new starts, primarily at our West Coast shipyard and that plus we may see depending on the Navy needs, we may see additional material come in this year and that tends to carry a lower margin. So, I'm just at the absolute -- let's say very nominally I want -- condition that there's two things that we don't have as much clarity about as we typically do in any given quarter and so that's why I gave you that -- ever so-mild caveat.","Myles Walton","Yes, I know. I was just clarifying because it looked like revenue was running ahead, so that makes sense on the margin. Thanks Phebe.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Hey, good morning guys. Phebe what's your view as you look at this two-year budget deal that's kind of shaped up this week for 2021. How do you think about the Navy\u2019s ability to afford the Columbia class or for the potential for that program to crowd out other ship priorities or other programs for \u2013 if we are going to go into a flattening, kind of, environment?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, it\u2019s certainly very good news that it looks like we've got some clarity in our political landscape at the moment. Listen, let's talk about Columbia for a moment. Columbia is a national priority and I have no doubt that as a national priority funding will be made available for it. There are a lot of different ways to do that from a budget perspective and I think that the U.S. Congress and our customer is talking about various avenues of ways to ensure healthy budgeting.","I'll tell you back when we did the Ohio in the 80s a separate account was set up. That's a potential option. So I don't worry too much about Columbia crowding other programs out. There is an imperative for the Navy to recapitalize its ships and build more ships. There is a consensus in Washington across political spectrum, at least political parties -- leadership in the major political parties that understand that we need ships and we need to replace the under seed light of the deterrent. And So I'm comfortable that the Department of Defense working with the Congress will find appropriate funding mechanisms to address what you have raised. ","Pete Skibitski","Got it. Just as a follow-up what's the reason behind the -- at a higher pre-owned volumes this year at Gulfstream? Is that --- just a really active market? Or maybe this year is just an anomaly in terms of initial 600 customers or something like that? ","Phebe Novakovic","There is nothing in particular. On occasion we'll have a bit more pre-owned but it signifies nothing. ","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Carter.","Jason Aiken","Good morning. ","Carter Copeland","Just a quick clarification and question. I had in my notes that Maximus was like a $900 million impact on the organic calculation, but I think you said 250 plus. Phebe, I just wondered if you would clarify that for us. And then just wondering now that you've gotten certification at Aerospace on the two new airplanes if you expect -- R&D to be a little bit more stable I know you had a comparison in the quarter that caused a little bit year-over-year variability, but should we expect that to be a little bit more steady in the future than we've seen in the last several quarters?","","Phebe Novakovic","So me -- let's answer that in inverse order. As we move the test airplanes from the test program in the customer set you'll see some reduction in R&D. And then as you all know we keep a nice level loaded amount of R&D in our business. We think that that's appropriate and so I think we'll see some decline. But we continue to have an active R&D -- series of active R&D activities in that -- in Gulfstream. ","Jason Aiken","And then Carter on the first half of your question, I think, your inference was correct on the scale of the business that we divested to Maximus. There were however in the last 12 months or so a couple of other smaller divestitures we did in the IT portfolio. We had a small commercial health care divestiture. We had a next-generation 911 supportive business. When you add all those up the total annualized revenues were somewhere slightly in excess of $1 billion so that was to Phebe's point, a roughly $250 million a quarter impact. ","Carter Copeland","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks for the clarification.","Howard Rubel","And Rocco this will be our last question coming up now please.","Operator","Absolutely. Our final question today comes from Jonathan Raviv of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Raviv","Hey, thank you for the timing. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Jonathan Raviv","Phebe in terms of supporting that GDIT ramp into 2020, can you give us some color on how the personal recruiting site is going? I know it's a very important part of the people business.","Phebe Novakovic","So those management teams have gelled. We took leaders from both legacy businesses and they have really gelled into one team one fight throughout the first three quarters and during this acquisition and integration we have kept almost every single key leader that we wanted to keep, I believe every leader we wanted to keep. And we are reducing our staff turnovers.","So all of that to me is very wholesome sign that we are building a cohesive team that is -- at GDIT up and down their leadership chain that can maintain a very long-term robust and successful business. I'm very pleased with what I've seen there both in terms of the energy level, the cohesion and the culture that they have established, it's really quite impressive.","Jonathan Raviv","Great, thanks. And then just thinking about that pickup. I mean, some peers in the market tend to talk about mid single digit organic growth. I know market share is not as important to you guys, but is that how we should think about the potential and should EBITDA growth accelerate in line with sales growth in 2020?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, I think we're growing about 3% this year and we'll see some nice growth in 2020. But beyond that we're not going to piecemeal 2020 at this point. We'll give you our 2020 estimate and outlook and detailed view of the business as we always do in the fourth quarter call after our fall review where we do in-depth analyses and bottom up operations reviews of each one of our businesses and we'll let you know then. Fair enough?","Jonathan Raviv","That\u2019s right. Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","You did. Thank you.","Howard Rubel","And thank you for joining our call today.

My name is Emma, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen - only mode. We will conduct a question - and - answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma\u2019am.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, Emma and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics\u2019 first quarter conference call. As always, any forward - looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks, Erin. Earlier today we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over a billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.20 and were well ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We were also better than our previous guidance and our own expectations. I should point out that we enjoyed an effective tax rate of 29% as opposed to consensus of around 30.5%. This accounted for approximately $0.05 of the outperformance. Jason Aiken will more fully discuss the tax rate a little later. I should further note that the diluted weighted average share count was 334 million for the quarter compared to consensus of approximately 332 million, so none of the outperformance comes from a lower than expected share count. I have asked Jason to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks.","All in all, this is a truly strong quarter from an operating perspective as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.2% and a return on revenue of 9.2%. It was a good quarter from a cash perspective as well. We had 745 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of 98 million, we had 647 million of free cash flow from operations, about 90% of net income. The general comparisons quarter - over - quarter are pretty compelling compared to the first quarter 2014, revenue was up 519 million or 7.1%. Total defense revenue was up 10.1%, pretty remarkable. Our operating earnings were slightly more than $1 billion, up 17.5% over the prior year\u2019s quarter leading to a 120 basis points improvement in margins. A very strong operating leverage is an important part of the story. Net earnings were up more than operating earnings, primarily due to the previously mentioned lower tax rate. Finally, EPS was up 25.1% over the year ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings , lower tax rate and lower share count. Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First Aerospace, sales are down by 17 million compared to Q1 2014, less than 1% and down 132 million sequentially against the strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, earnings outpaced the year ago quarter by 27 million, about 6.7% on a 140 basis points expansion in operating margins. Operating earnings were also up 19 million sequentially. The 20.4 operating margin for the group represents the high with both companies contributing. A word of caution here, we are out of the gate fast but this pace is not sustainable from a margin perspective. Orders were not overly strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2024. It was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong quarter. This is consistent with what we saw on the first quarter 2014 following the strong fourth quarter at 2013. We\u2019re off to a very good start in the Aerospace group. Marine Systems, revenue of 1.94 billion was up 342 million or 21.4% compared to the year ago quarter and down 97 million sequentially as one would expect against the fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings were up 22 million or 13.3% against the year ago quarter and down 5 million sequentially. We have particularly good performance at Electric Boat in NASSCO. Some of the more striking comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, sales were up 105 million or 8.3% and earnings were up 65 million or 46.8% on a 400 basis points improvement in operating margins. Recall that the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a 29 million restructuring charge at European Land Systems as a result of reductions in the Austrian operations which were consolidated in Spain and Switzerland. If we disregard that charge, margins would have been 13.4% on a pro forma basis. Even on that basis, the improvement in this year\u2019s operating margins is a significant 160 basis points. Sequentially, revenue was down 251 million and operating earnings are down 67 million as anticipated in the business to always have a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract delivery. All up, continued strong performance at Combat Systems. It\u2019s been a long times since we\u2019ve been able to report an increase in revenue in this group. IS&T, the big upside surprise incurred this group. You might recall that our guidance was to expect a revenue decline of 5.5% year - over - year, well that certainly did not happen in the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up 89 million or 3.9% against the year ago quarter and off only 98 million against the powerful fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings of 217 million were 34 million more than a year ago quarter, up 18.6% on a 120 basis points improvements in margins. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up 5 million on a 60 basis points improvement in margins once again nice operating leverage. The 9.2% operating margins was the best that this group has achieved in a while and is very encouraging. The trend is in the right direction. So we\u2019re off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectations. We do not as a practice change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice and has been for three years to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Sufficed to say that we are ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance is based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and continue to outperform.","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.","Jason Aiken","Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I want to start with the subject that we haven\u2019t talked about a lot in the past and that\u2019s foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar we\u2019re seeing an impact in our reported results. Now to be clear this doesn\u2019t involve any economic gain or loss in any of our contracts, what I\u2019m referring to is the translation of our international operating results from their local currencies to US dollars for reporting purposes. Absent the movement of foreign currency translation rates, the growth in our revenues and earnings over the first quarter of 2014 would have been even more robust than the numbers you see. Specifically, our US dollar reported revenues and operating earnings in the quarter were reduced by approximately 120 million and $20 million respectively compared with the exchange rate that prevailed in the first quarter of last year. In addition, our backlog was reduced by 450 million from year end due to the same translation issue. Setting the FX impact aside, our Combat Systems backlog would have been essentially unchanged from year end and our IS&T backlog would have been up slightly more than reported. Moving on to a couple of items on our income statement, net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of maturing fixed rates notes with proceeds from marketable securities on hand. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position that\u2019s cash in excess of debt of $1 billion essentially unchanged from year end. As Phebe mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate was a bit lower than we had forecast and a bit lower than analyst consensus of around 30.5%. The effective rate was 29% for the quarter versus 30.1% a year ago and the primary driver was some R&D tax credit claims that were settled during the quarter. For the year, we are now anticipating an effective tax rate in the ballpark of 29.5%. On the capital deployment front you may recall that in the first quarter of last year we repurchased to a little over 14 million shares including about 11 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the end of the first quarter of 2014, our diluted share count is down another 12.5 million shares the result of almost 20 million additional shares repurchased in the past four quarters and that includes approximately 4.7 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of this year. Altogether, we spent $826 million on share repurchases we spent 826 million on share repurchases during the first quarter or 1.3 times of free cash flow from operations. Erin that concludes my remarks, I\u2019ll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan","Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Emma, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Erin. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein","Could you talk a little bit more about Aerospace and the margin? I mean you said that is was not sustainable but there were a couple of headwinds that you had identified before what might hold the margins back this year and so I guess what of that did we not see in the quarter?","Phebe Novakovic","So as we\u2019ve talked about before Aerospace margins tend to be lumpy and estimating that with precision is kind of like putting the tail on a moving donkey. But that said in the quarter, we had a very favorable service mix high service levels with a good mix. We recognized some tax credits, suppliers\u2019 settlement. So it was really more on the upside than really any headwinds but the risk of getting ahead of our second quarter guidance I\u2019ve already noted to you that our quarter one margins were above our expectations and we\u2019re going to beat the guidance I gave you in January I\u2019m just not sure by what amount. So I want to reserve those commentary to the second quarter.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Raviv","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jon Raviv in for Jason. Thanks for taking my question.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Jon.","Jonathan Raviv","Phebe, just an notional question or high level question about your net cash position, what are you seeing in terms of deployment opportunities here given your very attractive balance sheet?","Phebe Novakovic","Well we\u2019re in a net cash position at the moment which Jason referred to and we tend to no debt position not trying to say net cash. I think we gave you guidance and our intention in January call we will deploy in the absence of any alternatives if there aren\u2019t any we will deploy all of our free cash flow and then to some to share repurchases and that strategy hasn\u2019t changed.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning Phebe, Jason.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Phebe, I wondered if you could elaborate a little bit on the big surprise on the top line and IS&T obviously it\u2019s your shorter cycle business quite a big revenue delta from what you had talked about in the prior quarter. Wondered if you could just give us some color on what it was that shifted or came in into the quarter? How should we think about thinking of the impacts on the remainder of the year in terms of performance and just any color you could give would be great.","Phebe Novakovic","So, we had an increased sales activity across both Mission Systems and our GD IT business. our Mission Systems it was driven part by lower cost structure that we anticipated as a result of combined AIS and C4 which made us more competitive and that tends to be a pretty quick turnaround so some of the orders quickly turn into sales. We had good book to bill by the way in that program or in that whole group so that also us well for greater growth. But as we combined those two businesses we\u2019re seeing some additional sales volumes that comes in by the strength of going to market. On the IT business they\u2019ve won most of what they\u2019ve been bidding on. They are a power in the market space. And so look I don\u2019t have a sense of where we\u2019re going to end up in that business in particular given all the puts and takes by the end of the year but we\u2019ll have a real good sense by the end of next quarter. But a solid beat on revenues and we\u2019re very pleased.","Carter Copeland","Thanks, Phebe.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Morning.","Robert Stallard","Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the Aerospace side in terms of the large cabin markets and may be give us a feel of what some of the different regions particularly you\u2019re looking overseas outside the U.S?","Phebe Novakovic","Sure. The activity levels I would call as careful, in other words, we\u2019ve got plenty of pipeline but slow to contract not unlike what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. In short, North American and the Mid - East are okay. Russia, Latin America and China are slow at the moment, 650 ER demand is robust so we\u2019re holding our own and then some. I think however, it\u2019s important to understand the of the case behind how we\u2019ve won this business how we have historically and how we will continue to do so. The only decline we worry about is a decline in earnings. So accordingly, we always throw production down in the face of weak orders. We have no intention of doing so this year. Given our large 650 backlog we can, to some degree, feather in more 650s to cover potential downfalls and of course we always take cost out of that business. So I think the way to think about both streams for the next two years is not necessarily as a strong revenue growth story. Gross over turn for the new airports enter into service and this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated and predictable in a business that continues to refresh its product line with clean sheets design airplanes. So, I thought it would be helpful to give you a little sense of when we see changes in demand how we act but I\u2019d say that the first quarter was cautious coming after a robust fourth quarter and this is pretty much of what we have seen in the first quarter for the last couple of years.","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. Phebe just may be pick up on the last question I think you said the next couple of years, and just on the G500 entering the service it does seem like you\u2019re certainly ahead of where you could be? But without pulling for the schedule in this conference call, green deliveries will there be a source of good revenue growth in 2017 like the 650 was in 2011?","Phebe Novakovic","So, we\u2019ll start to recognize activity in 2017 in anticipation of entry into service in the first quarter of 2018. It\u2019s really in the next two years and it\u2019s a transition period, I think that\u2019s how you should think about it and we anticipate it that as well. And you could expect that given that we\u2019ve got new airplanes coming on.","Myles Walton","And just which was on the inventory of used aircraft, you sold one in the quarter, did the level of used inventory that you\u2019re holding rise, fall or stayed the same?","Phebe Novakovic","No, it was the same.","Myles Walton","Same. Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Yes, good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Doug.","Doug Harned","Just continuing on with Gulfstream, when you look at the transition period and think about what trajectory might be for 450 and 550 deliveries, could you give us a sense on how you envision that going or sort of what their backlogs are right now for those airplanes? And then when you think about it, as you said before, you have the ability to take 650 up, given a lot of strong demand for that airplane, do you see the potential to increase rates some on 650 within that next two year period?","Phebe Novakovic","So, we haven\u2019t given you the backlog and broken it up by aircraft model, but again let\u2019s just talk about the theory of the case. When you\u2019re bringing in new aircraft, the trick is to feather in that production with the existing plane. So that you have a nice, smooth transition and that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving for and that\u2019s what we will achieve. There\u2019s no reason to think that that isn\u2019t going to happen. The 650 has a quite a significant order book and in fact, the deliveries the next to billable airplanes has actually slipped to the fourth quarter to \u201817. So that healthy and long backlog gives us some flexibility, nice flexibility to feather in some more 650s to offset that transition period the feathering in as we move to the new airplanes. So wouldn\u2019t be all together a bad thing either that would reduce the wait time on those 650s and the 650 ER demand.","Doug Harned","So you are seeing the potential to - the demand out there to do some earlier 650 deliveries if you want to?","Phebe Novakovic","Sure. We\u2019re going to be prudent about it. It\u2019s not wise to eat through your backlog, but to the extent that we can and want to we will feather in some additional 650s if that makes sense.","Doug Harned","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi.","Robert Spingarn","Jason, I\u2019ve got one for you if I could, it\u2019s on the free cash flow which was really quite strong in the quarter. I think Phebe said last quarter that international advanced timing would put some pressure on free cash flow this year and it did in the quarter, but their collections looked very strong. Could you talk about working capital and how we should think about the cadence of free cash flows and go forward through the year?","Jason Aiken","Sure. We were, as you said, off to a strong start in the first quarter and to be quite frank, stronger than even we had expected. As we signaled coming into the year, we\u2019re expecting a bit of a softer cash flow outlook and as you think would expect in response to that our business has turned toward sort of war on operating working capital and went after it hard first quarter. And really that is the story. You could see even despite a pretty big draw down in the customer advances related to some of those international programs otherwise excluding that OWC was down in the quarter. So, really strong performance out of the gate, I would caution you that we don\u2019t necessarily expect the first quarter to be reflective of the full year. We\u2019re still expecting a tough road ahead with some of the headwinds that we\u2019ve talked about. But really our focus is all about that management at OWC and going after the collections as well as the supply side.","Robert Spingarn","Is there any particular timing we should think about where some of this strength reverses? I mean I guess for the year you\u2019ll do about a 100% as you normally do or little better, but is there a weak quarter in here?","Jason Aiken","I would suggest the second half is where most of the pressure is there on that front. So we\u2019ll be managing that through the balance of the year.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you and terrific performance, Phebe. Well done.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks, Cai.","Cai von Rumohr","So, Aerospace, may be if you could kind of give us the numbers you give us on the lead times on each of those programs and little color. You mentioned the suppliers settlement may be if you could quantify any one - timers that bolstered the numbers in the first quarter at Aerospace? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah, so as I noted the 650 and 650 ER are out to the fourth quarter \u201817 G550 G450 out in 12 month where they have been, G280 and G150 G280 at the end of this year 150 first quarter next year. So pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve been reporting all along. As I tried to explain earlier we had a number of moving targets in the Gulfstream margin provided considerable margin improvement service mix we took in some tax credits. We did have that supplier settlement I\u2019m not going to give you any particular numbers on any of these and jet performed well. So couple of those are one timers but I\u2019m not going to quantify them for you I don\u2019t think that\u2019s productive. We\u2019re very particularly with respect to our suppliers we are very proprietary about talking about our relationships with our suppliers.","Cai von Rumohr","Can you quantify the total of all of those without giving any of the granularity?","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah, I mean we\u2019ve led you to about 18% for the year I didn\u2019t give you by quarter - by - quarter as I explained to you before we get real lumpiness in Aerospace margins which we\u2019ve talked about. So I\u2019m not prepared to change the year guidance but you can back in to some of that. As I said, this is - both streams has an awful lot of moving parts and so does Jet Aviation so, we have seen in the last couple of years lot of lumpiness. We\u2019re not going to see that 20% repeated going forward as explained to you we\u2019re going to outperform I just don\u2019t know I have much yet and I can\u2019t discuss that half way through the year.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes. Good morning, Phebe, Jason.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi.","Peter Arment","Phebe, may be just to stay on Aerospace, you mentioned Jet Aviation continues to be a positive contributor. Can you give us little more color on what you\u2019re seeing there and also related to that are you seeing any kind of slowdown in utilization rates in the large cabin tight kind of the energy market just given these sell off the way we see it last six months?","Phebe Novakovic","We continue to build that business. They\u2019ve been a positive contributor on both cash and earnings for the last 2.5, 3 years. We\u2019ve seen no change in demand as a result of - no decrease in demand as a result of the change in oil prices, in fact, we\u2019re seeing higher demand. Backlog, the pipeline is good and we\u2019re adding to the backlog. So, that business is increasingly well positioned.","Peter Arment","Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Howard.","Howard Rubel","How are you?","Phebe Novakovic","Good.","Howard Rubel","I don\u2019t want to leave Marine alone here.","Phebe Novakovic","Good.","Howard Rubel","I mean you did spend a little time there, so I figure it\u2019s probably a worn off a little on you. So there\u2019s couple things that stand out. One was the backlog growth second was you kind of LHA post shakedown availability which sort of sets you up to do some interesting things. And it looks like NAASCO did pretty well in a world where commercial is hard to do. So, may be you could talk a little bit about some of the variances and is this sustainable rate you\u2019re seeing in Marine or was there some deliveries or some other material items that sort of tweak the numbers?","Phebe Novakovic","I think what you can expect is Marine will replicate its behavior in the past such as steady Eddy. There was no one particular element that drove margin performance. With respect to sales growth, that\u2019s coming from a couple of places. We have increased sales at NAASCO on commercial work, and remember we\u2019re moving into the Block IV which brings with it higher revenue and also we\u2019re seeing increased revenue on the engineering and design for Ohio replacement. So, all of those are long - term programs that will continue to carry revenue and predictable earnings with them.","Howard Rubel","And just to follow up for a moment, how is it that - what have you done there to make sure, for example at NAASCO, that there\u2019s some opportunity to continue the business because I know that\u2019s always challenging from time to time? And then also, making sure that Ohio replacement stays on schedule.","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, so with respect to NAASCO, they\u2019ve got a nice backlog commercial and government may be new construction and recall, repair continues to grow for NAASCO. We have a bi - coastal presence back when I was AVP of the Marine Group, we\u2019ve got a couple of East Coast repair yards that have done beautifully. So we\u2019ve really increased our hiring power in repair and we\u2019re performing very nicely. The repair business is moving to and the Navy is moving to from cost plus contracts to fixed pricing repair in selected instances. And that\u2019s a real upside potential for us, we\u2019re really pleased with that. So, the repair business is robust. NAASCO is performing well, they keep their cost bases low for continuous improvement and that is a highly functioning shipyard. So, I like where they stand. They\u2019re competitive in the commercial market space and of course, [indiscernible] as well continues to drive down its cost structure. And we\u2019ll see over time increased margin improvement as we get further into Block IV in a continuous improvement. Every time you start a new Block, we have some questions in margins we\u2019ve given back some of the goodness of the prior Block to the Navy, but we, over the last decade plus, reduced cost structure and continue to improve margin. So, they\u2019re very, very well positioned.","Howard Rubel","Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David Strauss","Phebe could you dig in a little bit more into the growth that we saw at Combat, it sounds like it came through ahead of what your expectations were? Was this [indiscernible] you in case starting to ramp up and does it accelerate from here?","Phebe Novakovic","I lost part of your question, it broke up. Could you repeat it for us?","David Strauss","Can you hear me now?","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah. I can hear you now.","David Strauss","I was asking if you could dig a little bit more into the growth at Combat, it sounded like it did come through ahead of your expectations, is that in the UK program starting to ramp and does that actually accelerate from here? And then a separate question, press has report that you pulled out of a couple of programs in the quarter, competitions TX and Manpack if you could just touch on those as well? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Sure. So look you would expect with the prodigious increase in backlog that we experienced last year that we begin to see that backlog turn into sales and revenue increases and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in that group. But across the portfolio, on our Canadian Middle East contract, we are finishing up our design efforts and the initial variance and we are going to begin production later this year. The delivery is in \u201816 on the UK program, we\u2019re working some small quantities of pre - productions but again, that will begin to ramp up and there is - the army is increasing its capitalization in their wheel and track vehicles, so all of that is upside and that we\u2019ve recognized some of that. So look, that backlog is still flowing into sales and the key there is to perform on that backlog. So let me talk to you, you asked the second question that is kind of interesting that we have pulled out some competitions, let me give you a sort of theory of the case here. We are not going to compete for programs to respond RFPs where we do not believe that we can get a fair and sufficient returns. Chasing revenues that don\u2019t have good earnings doesn\u2019t help us or our shareholders. So this really has more to do with the discipline with how we run our company rather than the response in any particular program. We\u2019re just not going to compete in programs what we think that we can\u2019t make up their return and a good return.","David Strauss","Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please proceed.","Ronald Epstein","Good morning, Phebe. I just wanted to touch base quickly if you could remind us what you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation, particularly there\u2019s some new properties on the market right? I mean that might be an opportunity for you guys to do some vertical integration? Just what are you thinking about, M&A, vis - \u00e0 - vis cash return to shareholders?","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah, so Ron I\u2019m not thinking about M&A because I\u2019m not seeing anything. So it\u2019s again not on my radar screen. And our intent with respect to capital deployment remains the same for this year. We\u2019re going to return capital to our shareholders and share repurchases and dividend. So I think that\u2019s pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing and what we\u2019ve been saying. Okay?","Ronald Epstein","Yeah, that\u2019s great. Can I ask one quick follow on if I may?","Phebe Novakovic","Sure.","Ronald Epstein","Could you give us a quick update on how things are proceeding with the G600 program the development there and the developments on the G500 program?","Phebe Novakovic","So we\u2019re proceeding well on both the near term G500, we had our first flight this quarter and we\u2019re on track with no particular surprises. And the G600 we\u2019re starting to build the first prototype so all\u2019s well. We\u2019re on track and in line with our expectations were.","Ronald Epstein","Okay. Just curious if there\u2019s any chance that the 500 could happen sooner, if certified sooner?","Phebe Novakovic","You mean first flight or entry into service?","Ronald Epstein","Entry into service, yeah.","Phebe Novakovic","That will depend on the FAA\u2019s test program so that\u2019s really - we work really closely with the FAA. They have an important job to do and we\u2019re really working together there of pacing items here.","Ronald Epstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. Thanks for the time.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi.","Hunter Keay","Hey Phebe, I want to follow up on the question in your response to David\u2019s question, the comment on TX specifically or just broadly about how you\u2019re not going to invest on. We\u2019re not going to be it on programs that don\u2019t provide fair or decent returns to your shareholders. Was there something about the comment about TX specifically but there was something about the way that particular program was structured that appealed to you or was it more a comment was broadly about investments it would require from you guys given that\u2019s not sort of in your core wheel house to participate in that program with the sort of ambiguous return? The latter?","Phebe Novakovic","To fit in the nutshell. It\u2019s not in our core. We had been thinking about participating on the air front was interested in the off the shelf trainer. Once the climate started to change there isn\u2019t just no way that becomes an attractive program for us. So I think the appropriate response and good discipline what\u2019s the prior that we just politely bow out.","Hunter Keay","Okay, thank you, Phebe. And then quick follow up, can you update the pre - owned delivery expectations this year or you\u2019re still thinking it\u2019s going to be up year over year how should we think about that? Thanks for the time. In Aerospace.","Jason Aiken","Yeah, I think as we look at the year we\u2019re still expecting the numbers to be up a little bit from what we see in the past couple of years so little bit lighter in the first quarter than what we were expecting but balance of the year we\u2019re still seeing that coming.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.","Peter Skibitski","Hey great quarter guys.","Phebe Novakovic","Thank you.","Peter Skibitski","Phebe, I just wanted to go further on capital deployment. I like when I\u2019m hearing about stay away from M&A frankly it kind of begs the question on repurchases because I think you got a new 10 million authority in February. And I\u2019m guessing coming out of the quarter probably only left about 7 million shares, you\u2019re probably going to do 2 billion plus in cash for the rest of the year so I\u2019m wondering do you plan to go back to the board some time may be this summer to increase the authority?","Phebe Novakovic","So look, we came at out of the Gate strong on cash as I told what I told the Street on January is the way you think about 2015 cash is that we\u2019re going to have a lighter cash year than we typically do have. And I\u2019m not prepared to change that. So do not think about the cash generation in terms that we have historical terms. But that said, let Jason give you a little more color on where we are on the share repurchases.","Jason Aiken","Yeah, I think you were pretty close on your estimates there. We had about 2 to 2.5 billion shares remaining by our buyer authorization when we got the additional 10 million in February. And I think we\u2019re sitting with right around 7.7 or so remaining at this point so. So I think that I\u2019ll look at Phebe but anything beyond that at the discretion of our board.","Peter Skibitski","And hey Jason I didn\u2019t hear you object when Rob suggested a onetime free cash conversion for the year?","Jason Aiken","No, I think as Phebe signaled and I apologize if I missed that question or his predicate, as Phebe mentioned we\u2019re not expecting to be quite as strong as their traditional performance this year. So expect something little bit lighter than that little bit lighter than the first quarter.","Peter Skibitski","Okay, thank a lot.","Phebe Novakovic","Emma I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay, so your last question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi from Stifel. Please proceed.","Joe DeNardi","Phebe with IS&T and some of the outperformance you\u2019ve seen there really over the past, 12 months at this point is it more a reflection of the budget environment and the procurement behavior being better than expected or is that the win rate has been better?","Phebe Novakovic","We\u2019re seeing a little bit more activity on the budget side but it\u2019s really our win rate has improved as we continue to take cost out of our business we become more competitive. And by the way that\u2019s true in the United States, Canada and the UK which is where Mission Systems placed heavily.","Joe DeNardi","Okay, thank you.","Erin Linnihan","Okay.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Alyssa, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that concluded, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic"," Good morning and thank you, Howard. So, earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.77 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $1.02 billion and earnings of $3.51 per fully-diluted share. This 14% improvement in EPS against the fourth quarter of 2018 was a result in part of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement at Aerospace was a major driver of this result."," We enjoyed a very solid fourth quarter and a strong 2019. We achieved most of our operational and financial goals and added meaningfully to our backlog, in some cases rather dramatically. The results in comparisons with prior periods are straightforward and rather compelling. I'll go through them briefly, I'll leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2020 and your questions."," I also think you'll find the press release and the highlights chart on our website fulsome and helpful. As we had indicated at the start of the year, the final quarter was our strongest. Earnings per share at $3.51 beat consensus by $0.06, revenue and operating earnings were somewhat better, our provision for tax was lower offset somewhat by a higher share count and higher borrowing cost. So, all-in-all, a solid quarter with good performance compared to the year ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2019.","For the full-year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.98. Revenue of $39.35 billion was up over 2018 by $3.2 billion an increase at each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.6 billion were up $191 million or 4.3% over 2018. Earnings from continuing operations of $3.5 billion were up to $126 million or 3.8% over 2018. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.76 above 2018.","Our business was strengthened by significant growth in our backlog to a new high of $87 billion. A very strong order intake particularly in aerospace and marine, positions the company well for 2020 and beyond.","Let me review the full-year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we have significantly more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter of 2019. So, I'll discuss each group, provide some color where appropriate.","First Aerospace, aerospace revenue of $2.9 billion was up $226 million or 8.4% against the year ago quarter. This increase was attributable to deliveries of the 600 and favorable mix related to the rest of the product line. Services were stable. Quarterly earnings were up $98 million, an increase of more than 25%.","For the full-year, revenue of $9.8 billion was up $1.35 billion or 16% over 2018. Operating earnings of $1.53 billion were up $42 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating margins were attributable to the mix as we continue to transition at Gulfstream delivering G500s and the initial G600 aircraft.","Pre-owned sales also negatively impacted margins and profit. Excluding the pre-owned revenue and losses provide an indication of the underlying strength of the operations. Margins on that basis were 16.1% versus 15.6% as reported. Furthermore, margins increased on a sequential basis throughout the year.","At mid-year last year, we told you to expect revenues about $9.95 billion with earnings about $1.525 billion. We finished the year with somewhat less revenue, a better margin rate and somewhat higher earnings. Deliveries were 147 versus our forecast of 145. All-in-all, very close to the forecast we gave you.","On the order front, activity in the quarter was stellar and the pipeline remains strong. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was $1.7 to $1denominated and better than that for Gulfstream alone. For Gulfstream airplane deliveries versus orders, it was two times on dollar basis. For the year, on both a unit and dollar basis, orders were 54% higher than 2018. Backlog is up about $2 billion sequentially and for the year.","From a qualitative perspective, we were quite pleased with the customer mix and product demand. All major regions experienced greater demand including Asia-Pacific, the Mid-East and particularly Europe. During the year, we delivered the 400, G650. The airplane continues to be in demand. Orders for the aircraft were up year-over-year.","We continue to work with the AUSA and expect G600 to be certified shortly. All five of the G700 flight test aircraft are complete, and we've begun installation of an interior on the six aircraft. We are making good progress toward first flight. G500 and G600 unit manufacturing costs continue to decline and we are producing very good quality. You should see more G500 and G600 deliveries as the year unfolds.","Next Combat, revenue in the quarter of $2 billion was 13.1% above a year ago. Operating earnings of $284 million were also well ahead of the final quarter of 2018. For the full-year revenue of $7 billion was up $766 million, a 12.3% increase. Operating earnings of $996 million were up $34 million.","By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at mid-year. We enjoyed better revenue than our forecast, and had earnings of about $1 billion similar to our outlook. We continue to see the opportunity for further growth of the business.","The FY '20 Army budget fully supports our programs and we continue to see significant international opportunities, particularly in Europe. We are continuing to negotiate with Spain on a large vehicle program that provides the Spanish Army with important new capabilities.","In the U.S., our Army customer is modernizing which provides steady demand across our Combat Vehicle ammunitions businesses. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued it's history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity.","Next, Marine Systems, this is a really good new story. Marine fourth quarter revenue of $2.57 billion was up $268 million, a compelling 11.7% increase over the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $199 million were down $14 million against the strong fourth quarter in 2018.","For the full-year, revenue of $9.2 billion was up $681 million or 8%. Operating earnings for the year of $785 million were up by $24 million or 3%, despite a 50 basis point drop in margins. At the midpoint of 2019, we expected revenue of about $9 billion, and operating earnings of $770 million. We came in above that for both.","As you are aware, we signed the Virginia-class Block V contract in December. This $22 billion award provides the Navy important increase in its capability, and affords us the opportunity to make a fair return.","In response to the significant increase demand from our Navy customer, we continue to invest in each of our yards particularly at EB to prepare for Block V and the new Columbia Ballistic-Missile Submarine. In preparation for EBs increased work scope on Block V, we constructed additional facilities at constant point to build the payload modules. So, suffice it to say, that we are poised to support our Navy customers, they increase the size of the fleet and deliver value to our shareholders, as we work through this very large backlog.","Now to our Information Technology, IT generated revenue in the quarter of $2.024 billion and operating earnings of $172 million, with an attractive 8.5% operating margin. EBITDA margin was 13.1%. Quarter-over-quarter revenue was lower due to several divestitures, delays and award execution in the completion of mature programs in the start of new ones, in other words, timing and mix. A case in point, there are now $22.7 billion in awards that has been delayed, compared to $10.4 billion at the end of 2018.","Our integration remains ahead of schedule both in terms of building an integrated and unified business, as well as achieving our cost synergies, the benefit of both are beginning to emerge. For the year revenue was $8.4 billion and operating earnings were $620 million, with a 7.5% margin. EBITDA margin grows to 12.6% in 2019 from 12% in 2018. We are encouraged by the 14.7% year-over-year increase in our backlog to $9.1 billion, but there is more work to be done.","At mid-year, we had indicated revenues of about approximately $8.5 billion and operating earnings would be around $630 million. We were touched by it in revenue but operating earnings was predicted. Let me remind you something about us we never accept lower margins in exchange for revenue.","Next, Mission Systems, revenue in the quarter of almost $1.3 billion was up 2.5% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $188 million were up $7 million, with margins up 20 basis points to 14.7%. For the year revenue of $4.94 billion was up $211 million or 4.5%. Operating earnings of $683 million were up $24 million or 3.6%. Book-to-bill for the year was one time with backlog at $5.4 billion.","Mission Systems revenue of $494 billion was just a touch short of the approximately $5 billion in revenue was expected for this business at mid-year. Margins of 13.8% matched our expectations. The business continues to show steady profitable growth.","Mission Systems offers critical, high consequence C4ISR and cyber systems that are built into platforms and missions that our customers relay on. This has positioned them well as they work to expand our capabilities into new market segments and to new platforms. ","On this call, at mid-year, on a company-wide basis our forecast for 2019 was to expect revenue of approximately $39.2 billion, operating earnings of $4.6 billion and EPS of $11.85 to $11.90. As you know, we round up ahead of that forecast.","Now, before I address guidance, I\u2019m going to ask Jason to address cash and specifically the near resolution of our issues with respect to our large international contract in Canada and several other key items. There have been some positive, very positive developments with respect to these issues in the last few weeks. Jason?","Jason Aiken","Thank you Phebe and good morning. I'm going to cover a number of topics to provide some color with respect to our 2019 results and some context for the 2020 guidance that Phebe will give you in just a few minutes.","First is cash. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, reflecting approximately 200% of net income. That resulted in the cash conversion rate of 57% for the full-year, obviously lower than we were striving for. As you might infer from this result, we did not collect the outstanding arrears on our large international combat vehicle program before the end of the year.","As Phebe noted, the good news is that in the weeks following the end of the year through engagement with our principal customer, we've laid out a new path forward that re-baselines the program, including updated delivery schedules, a revised payment plan going forward and a number of contractual terms that provide greater assurance of payment on a go forward basis.","In connection with this, we received a $500 million progress payment in January, and we will continue to receive scheduled progress payments on a newly established payment schedule. This includes an additional $500 million this year, and regular payments for product delivered in 2021 and beyond, that will bring down the working capital balance on this program over the next three years.","This increased clarity around payments on the program, gives us a greater level of assurance with respect to our expectations for free cash flows in the coming years. To that point, we expect our free cash flow conversion for 2020 to be in the 85% to 90% range, reflecting an increased pension contribution and the peak of our capital investments in our Marine Systems business to support the sizable growth that is coming in this decade and beyond, as well as the build of G700 test articles and initial inventories in anticipation of its 2022 entry in the service.","With these capital needs winding down and the liquidation of the working capital and combat systems, we expect free cash flow to exceed 100% of net income starting in 2021. Despite the cash shortfall in 2019, we were able to retire 100% of our outstanding commercial paper balance as anticipated. We ended the year with a cash balance of just over $900 million, and a net debt position of $11 billion.","Our net interest expense for the fourth quarter was $110 million, bringing interest expense for the full-year to $460 million. That compares $112 million and $356 million for the comparable 2018 periods. Our next scheduled debt maturity is for $2.5 billion in the second quarter of this year, and we expect interest expense to drop to $410 million in 2020 accordingly.","With our strong balance sheet and the increased certainty around our international cash forecast, we now have a level of financial flexibility that we did not enjoy last year. On the capital deployment front, in addition to repaying our commercial paper, we had capital expenditures of approximately $380 million in the fourth quarter for a full-year total just shy of $1 billion or 2.5% of revenues.","You may recall that we expect the 2019 CapEx to be closer to 3% of sales, but it came in slightly lower as we prudently managed these investments while working to resolve the international cash situation. At $449 million CapEx in the 2019 for Marine Systems accounted for 45% of our capital spending and was nearly four times its depreciation for the year.","We again expect Marine Systems to command a largest share of our capital budget in 2020, as we work toward satisfying the nation's need for its critical naval systems. As a result of some of the 2019 investments pushing to the right, we expect our capital investments to remain elevated in 2020, similar to the 2019 level and declining thereafter.","We also paid $294 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year of $1.2 billion. I alluded to our pension contributions earlier, and with respect to our pension plans we contributed $185 million in 2019, and we expect that to increase to approximately $470 million in 2020, the majority of that in the third quarter.","Turning to income taxes, we had a 16% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter resulting in a full-year rate of 17.1%, a little better than our previous guidance attributable primarily to the finalization of our 2018 tax return. Looking ahead to 2020, we expect a full-year effective tax rate of around 17.5%.","Next, I'd like to alert you to an accounting change that we've made starting in 2020. This relates to our treatment of pre-owned aircraft sales and our Aerospace group. As you're aware, this is an immaterial activity for us with transactions that are generally breakeven or at de minimis loss.","However, the forecasting and reporting of pre-owned sales results in noneconomic perturbations in revenue and operating margins for the Aerospace group that creates unnecessary confusion around the group's performance. As a result, we will no longer report pre-owned aircraft sales going forward, only the bottom line earnings impact, which is again, has historically been closed to breakeven.","When you consider the 2020 revenue guidance for the Aerospace group that Phebe will provide in just a moment, you should level set 2019 revenues excluding $292 million of pre-owned sales. So, for comparative purposes that would bring 2019 revenue for the group to approximately $9.5 billion.","The last item I'd like to provide a little color on is our backlog. We ended the year with a backlog at an all-time high of approximately $87 billion, exceeding the previous mark by more than $10 billion. And the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ value ended the year at over $126 billion, an increase of more than 22% over both the prior quarter and end of 2018. This is the result of very strong order activity across the board. That\u2019s four of our five segments posted a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater for the quarter and the year.","As Phebe noted, the Aerospace group had a very strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.7 times on revenue growth of almost 8.5%. This was the result of the second highest order quarter for the group ever, and its highest in over 10 years. That brings the full-year book-to-bill to 1.2 times on revenue growth of 16%.","Combat Systems have a solid book-to-bill of 0.8 times on revenue growth of over 12% for the year, though they were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, that reduced the backlog balance by $300 million versus the end of 2018.","GDIT and Mission Systems continued to have strong steady order activity, each with a 1 to 1 book-to-bill in the fourth quarter. And that brings Mission Systems to 1 to 1 for the year, and GDIT to 1.1 to 1 for the full-year. This marks five consecutive years that each of these businesses have had a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater.","And I would remind you that for both of these segments, the IDIQ value, which we don't report in orders or backlog, generates roughly half of their respective annual sales. For Mission Systems, this value was almost $7.5 billion at the end of the year, and for GDIT it reached $19 billion. This conservative approach of excluding this contract value from our reported order activity makes a direct comparison with some of their industry peers, somewhat less meaningful.","And finally, Marine Systems had an outstanding year with a book-to-bill of over 8 times in the quarter and approximately 3 times for the year. As we've discussed in the past, this group has large long-term contracts to provide clear visibility to revenue growth well into the future. To put a finer point on it, each of the shipyards in the group has firm backlog at the end of 2019 that run through the mid to latter part of this decade, providing significant opportunity for both top-line and bottom-line growth.","That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2020 and wrap-up remarks.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks, Jason. So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2020, initially by business group and then a companywide roll-up.","In Aerospace, we expect 2020 revenue to be about $10 billion, without pre-owned sales up from 2019. Operating margin will be about 15.7% to 15.8%. Revenue will be much stronger in the second-half as well margin rate. Operating margin will accelerate through the year similar to 2019, starting in the 14% range and ending around 18% by the fourth quarter. We are seeing 5% revenue growth in 2020 in between $40 million to $45 million of improved earnings.","In Combat, we expect revenues about $7.3 billion and approximately $300 million increase over 2019. We expect operating margins to be about 14.3%. Here again, look for both revenue earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year, with a particularly strong fourth quarter.","We continue to seek a solid growth for the business with orders for the Abrams and solid demand for our Stryker vehicles ammunitions. Like last year, we see domestic volumes rising faster than our international business. Although a few international opportunities could tip that bound.","The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9.85 billion, an increase of almost $700 million over 2019. Operating margin in 2020 is anticipated to be about 8.6%. We anticipate growth at each of our yards a long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work which is expanding exponentially. Our biggest opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted margin rate.","We expect IT revenue of approximately $8.45 billion consistent with 2019. With margins in the 7.6% range, the results in a modest increase in operating earnings. We expect Mission Systems revenue in 2020 of about $5.1 billion, an increase of approximately $140 million. We anticipate operating margins about 14.1%, again building throughout the year.","So, for 2020 companywide, we expect to see slightly more than $40.7 billion of revenue, up 4% over 2019, and operating margin of 11.9%. This all rolls to forecasted $12.55 to $12.60 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it did in 2019, with Q1 about $2.60, and progressively stronger quarters thereafter.","Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operation. It assumes a 17.5% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count constant with yearend figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital.","I should leave you with this final thought, the near imminent resolution of our large international contract and attendant cash issues, including the current receipt of funds provides enormous clarity in the liability of funds. This coupled with our strong balance sheet, leaves us with greater flexibility for capital deployment than we've had in the recent past. We intend to utilize it to create value for our shareholders.","Jason Aiken","Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up. So, Alyssa, would you please remind the participants how to enter the queue now, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein","Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi Ron. ","Ronald Epstein","Just following-up on your final comment there that you have more flexibility around capital deployment. That was a bit of a teaser. What are you thinking? I mean, what, buying back shares? I mean, what are you thinking about that?","Phebe Novakovic","So, we'll deal with our short term debt and then we will buy back shares appropriately.","Ronald Epstein","But, anything else? I mean, are you thinking about other things to do in the portfolio? Meaning, I mean, we've seen a flurry of M&A in the space. So I mean, is there anything --","Phebe Novakovic","We don't comment on M&A. Nice try, Ron.","Ronald Epstein","Okay. Alright. Alright, thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning. ","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, David.","David Strauss","Phebe, on the Gulfstream, I guess, revenue forecast. Can you help us a bit maybe at a high-level in terms of some of the moving pieces there? What you're expecting for total aircraft deliveries kind of the ramp down on the 650?","Phebe Novakovic","So, we expect about 150 aircraft deliveries this year, and consistent with our expressed plan to you all sometime ago. We will ramp down the 650 deliveries as we increase the 500 and 600 deliveries. So, that mix and cadence around that mix is anticipating, is playing out as anticipated.","David Strauss","And do you expect more of the 650 ramp down to occur in '20 or '21? I think before you've been talking about more of that hit coming in '20 versus '21?","Phebe Novakovic","Largely in '20, but we will continue to ramp according to really the demand. We are ramping to a point where we have demand and delivery in an equilibrium, and I'm quite comfortable that we'll get there. But, it's pretty clear that it was very clear to me that in 2020, 650 deliveries will as anticipated decrease.","Operator","The next question today comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. ","Robert Stallard","Thank you so much. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","On GDIT Phebe, it looks to me now the organic revenue growth has been a little bit below what some of the other peers in the industry been able to achieve, and that's why they continue in 2020. Now, is this a consequence of these award delays, or is it something to do with just the time it takes to integrate CSRA or something else? And when would you expect this revenue growth rate to pick up?","Phebe Novakovic","So, I was pretty explicit in my remarks around that, but just to reiterate. There were three fundamental factors. First, we experienced significant delays in the execution of awards. The velocity of execution slowed considerably, and the number of potential awards caught and this set of purgatory increased dramatically.","Second, and don't forget this, we exited two lines of business last year. And third, we had several mature programs and we lost one or two recompetes, both of which reduced near-term volume that will be replaced over time by our new limbs. So think of this latter category as mix and timing.","Robert Stallard","So is it safe to say\u2026","Phebe Novakovic","So, to your second question, we had anticipated 2019 from 2020 would show some growth, that growth has now moved to the right in 2021. And we're expecting mid-single digit growth, again driven by the execution and velocity of the contract awards.","Robert Stallard","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Thank you. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Doug. ","Doug Harned","Can you take us through a little bit on the Block V Virginia-class, because this is obviously a bigger boat, it's very important? What are the differences that you see between Block V and Block IV? And how should we expect that to flow through to financial performance over next several years?","Phebe Novakovic","So, you quite accurately point out the Block V represents a considerable increase in capability for the U.S. Navy, and a considerable increase in our workload, given that the addition of the new capabilities is executed entirely by us. And so, as we think about from Block IV to Block V, we continue to come down our learning curves. And we are sequencing all of these now builds around the first delivery of Columbia, which we\u2019ll start work at the end of this year.","So, I think that with respect to Block V, our job is simply to execute Block V effectively. And as I said in my remarks, the key here is just increasing our margin and really improving our ship over ship capabilities. So, we've got Block V in very good shape along with our Navy customer, and we've begun to work on it, and we will continue that execution for the next several years.","Doug Harned","And then you talked about the investment you're having to make for CapEx for both in Block V and Columbia class. But, when you think about the trajectory for that investment it's not just facilities but it's also labor. And when you look at planning for this, how do you see the trajectory for your costs and for reimbursement by the customers, you work to build up here?","Phebe Novakovic","So, let's take that in two fold. First, our customers well aware of the imperatives that we face. And they have worked closely with us to better match the investment with the return, which is wholesome for everyone. With respect to the essence, and now that your question ramping up on growth in our workforce, so we started this about eight years ago, working in public-private partnerships with Rhode Island and Connecticut to begin to trend the kinds of workers that we needed, and in large numbers. That coupled with our internal training program, we have demonstrated over the last four years. We have brought new shipbuilders into the yard at a higher initial capabilities. And then they continue to learn.","So, the Navy has fully supported our efforts with respect to expanding our workforce and the need to bring training up into skills that frankly in this country have atrophied. When you think about plumbing and pipe fitting and electricians and welders, welders are critical and key capability. A number of those in the U.S. training programs throughout the United States had to had atrophied a bit. And in our world up in New England, we are rebuilding those at a very rapid rate. So, we're very comfortable that we can meet our expectations for growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So at one point, Phoebe, you were talking about the G500 and 600 coming down the learning curve, and becoming more profitable as we move out in time. And I think you suggested in 2021, directionally margin should be up as that plus ways the mix shift away from the 650. Is that still a trend that you look for?","Phebe Novakovic","Yes, it's a trend that we look for and that we are experiencing. As you would expect from the operating discipline, and the price discipline and cost discipline that we have, we continue to see learning and nice learning on each and every one of these aircrafts coming down the line to offset the reduction in part, as offset the reduction in 650 deliveries.","We have clearly articulated this plan several years ago and we've been right on sequence on it. So, I think there's nothing new there in terms of the strategy and the execution around that strategy.","Cai von Rumohr","Terrific. And then Jason, quickly for you. You talked of conversion going to 100% in 2021. Can you give us some color in terms of how much does pension contribution come down if at all? How much does CapEx come down? And what kind of a benefit do you get from inventory liquidation on the 500 and 600? Thanks.","Jason Aiken","Sure. So, when you think about the capital investment, I think, I said earlier, we had expected about 3% of sales in 2019, and ended up at about 2.5%. You should expect to see that in a similar range, call it 2.5% in 2020 because of the elements of that that we pushed to the right. That'll step down starting in 2021, so that by call it 2023, we will be back to the typical, more historic typical 2% range that we've been in.","Pension contributions, on the other hand, as I mentioned, elevated $400 million plus in 2020. It will stay elevated for another year or so maybe a year and then come back down from there. So, a little bit of a surge in pension contribution and then returning back down to a lower level.","And then, I think in terms of the working capital, the biggest single thing that you should expect is we ended the year with somewhere close to the neighborhood of $2.9 billion of unbilled receivables contracting process if you will, on the large international combat vehicle program. That will step down to the point that that working capital is essentially liquidated by the end of call it 2023. That along with the 500 and 600 as you mentioned those test articles will be sold here in 2020 and 2021, respectively.","So, those will be a benefit. And as a result, the aggregate outcome of that as we expect to actually see free cash flow in '21 and beyond, call it 2021, '22 even '23, actually in excess of 100% of net income. So, we will start this recapture some of that shortfall that we've had over the past couple of years.","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi ","Hey, good morning. Phebe, if we go back four or five years, I think there was a debate as to how the Navy would afford Colombian and Virginia and they have decided to fill both simultaneously. When does that actually get locked in? Do you see any political risk to that that decision gets revisited whether to feather in a Colombian placement Virginia, or is that a risk going on at this point? Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","So, think about long-term demand for a given product line as driven by the war fighter's needs. And with respect to classes of our submarines there is real war fighter demand on Virginia. And then on Columbia, that is a national program and it can't wait. So the nation sees the decision-makers in both the executive branch and on capital you will see the imperative to fund and wholesomely fund both of those programs. And as we sit here today, we see pretty good surety, very good surety on a going forward basis. The stability of that backlog and the reliability of increasing backlog in submarine for quite some time to come.","Think about the submarine business, ship building in general, bur the submarine business in particular, as executing slowly over time relatively slowly over time given the complexity of building a nuclear submarine. That is offset in terms of predictability of backlog. These are very secure platforms, because they are in demand. They are in current demand and they will be in future demand, there are certain imperatives.","Operator","The next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak ","Hi, good morning everyone.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak ","Phebe, I wondered if you could just expand on what you're seeing in the overall business chat in Gulfstream demand environment, because on the one hand some of the leading indicator data there has looked a little tougher, but obviously you've got your new product set and have the really strong bookings in the quarter. So just kind of curious to here we're seeing. And was the book-to-bill excluding the G700 also above one in the quarter?","Phebe Novakovic","So, the answer to your question, the latter question is yes. If you have been following us and you have for some time, you'll know that that our basic predicate for this business is that new product and truly new product, clean sheet airplanes all new drive demand. And that predicate is where now, not surprisingly, in my mind.","So, our new products are generating demand and are expected new product in the 700 is generating demand. So, think about the experience of OEMs in this market as really idiosyncratic to the product offerings staff. So, our experience in this market is that we have enjoyed nice, steady demand year-over-year, that demanded is increased as the new products are announced and enter into service.","And in addition, so much of selling airplanes is predictability of the delivery and reliability of the airplane and the ability to service. All of that drives demand and we are, I think, arguably, without questions, the best-in-class with respect to all of those key factors. So, we are quite comfortable with our positioning and the fourth quarter was good and the pipeline is active.","Noah Poponak ","And then just on the margins in the segments. I think the company has said that the 2021 rate of expansion should be faster than the '20 rate of expansion, and I think you've even said getting back into the high-teens '21 maybe '22. Do I have that, right? Does that still hold in terms of the trajectory from here?","Phebe Novakovic","The trajectory does hold and will end this year in the high-teens margin. But then, so this is a complex business of lots of moving parts. So, margins tend to be somewhat variable quarter-over-quarter largely driven by mix. But again, the basic thesis around the introduction of these airplanes and the profitability and the realization of that profitability remains today, the same as it was.","Operator","The next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro ","Yes, good morning. Maybe, it doesn't look like the 650 deliveries really came down much if anything in '19. So, are the declines in '20 reflecting just lower backlog in 650 today, than a year ago or what's really driving the 650 decline?","Phebe Novakovic","650 backlog has not declined. We've seen a nice increase. Look, the deliveries quarter-over-quarter of these airplanes is often driven by customers. So we had, about three 600s that for various outside the United States regulatory issues, or delayed, we'll move into this delivery is expected for this quarter. And we have some 650s that customers wanted earlier, so we took a few of those. And we're able to execute and satisfy those customers' needs.","So, 650 has done extremely well, not in significantly, as we talked about in this call and the third quarter. There are a lot of demand signals and demand catalysts for the 650. The introduction to 700 clarified it. And frankly, as we told you, what has increased 650 demand. So, by the way, this airplane, we've got 400 of them in service, and some of them are coming out of warranty and there's a natural replacement cycle. So, we continue to see nice demand for the 650.","George Shapiro ","So why bring down the deliveries if the backlog is up, I must be missing something here?","Phebe Novakovic","Because, ultimately overtime you want to fully match the backlog with the deliveries. And if you recall, we entered this transition period with an extraordinarily long and I argued that time, a too long wait time. And we have equalized that wait time to order to wait time significantly during this transition period. And we'll get back to that regular cadence. But look, our 650 order book, and what we've got in backlog fully supports our going forward 650 production estimates. That's what you really want to see, if the order book is enough to satisfy your 650 deliveries.","Howard Rubel","Operator, this upcoming question will be our last.","Operator","The last question today comes from Seth Seifman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Good morning.","Seth Seifman","Phebe, you mentioned in Marine Systems that there was opportunity in operating margin. Are there specific milestones that you would point to potentially coming up this year? And if so, what and when are they?","Phebe Novakovic ","So, there are multiple milestones in any given year, and they are tied to exceedingly large number of internal milestones and milestones to our Navy customer. But that's not the only thing that drives. So, we will see some of those, as we always do in any given year. But really our ability to drive margins is all about the cost control and performance, and we continue to drive hard on both. This is a very high performance shipyard","Seth Seifman","Thank you very much.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. And thank you all for joining our call today.

My name is Sue, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, Sue, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' First Quarter Conference Call.","As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Thank you, Erin. I hope to be reasonably brief this morning. The press release and related charts are pretty straightforward and tell a rather compelling story.","We reported revenues for the quarter of $7.4 billion, operating earnings of $824 million and overall operating margins of 11.4%. This resulted in diluted EPS of $1.62 compared to consensus of $1.50.","Free cash flow was fairly strong across the business, particularly for a first quarter, at $429 million or approximately 75% of net income. This was considerably better than the cash performance in the first quarter of 2012 and considerably more than we had anticipated in our plan.","Given the defense market environment, this quarter compares favorably with the first quarter last year. Revenue is down modestly 2.3%. Operating earnings are essentially flat. Margins are up 10 basis points. Net income is up $7 million, and diluted EPS is up $0.05 or 3.2%.","On a sequential basis, there is significant improvement even if we look at the fourth quarter before nonrecurring charges. On a non-GAAP basis, without charges, the operating margins in the first quarter were 10.1% compared to 11.4% this quarter.","Let me give you a little bit of detail on the results of our operating segments and, hopefully, provide you some color. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue was up $155 million, almost 10% against the year-ago quarter, and profit is up $39 million, 14.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. I am pleased to report that jet aviation made a contribution in the quarter. In short, nice operating leverage.","From a market perspective, we're seeing adequate interest in both new and existing product lines. The backlog and orders in the quarter make me comfortable with the revenue projections I gave for Aerospace for the year. We have some opportunity to outperform our guidance. So far, so good.","At Combat Systems, revenue declined $358 million against the year-ago quarter, but operating earnings were up $12 million, almost 6% on 13.8% margin. However, it is well remembered that there was an accounting charge in the year-ago quarter for this segment. On a non-GAAP basis, ignoring charges, margins are flat. Sequentially, even after the fourth quarter non-GAAP adjustments, margins improved by 130 basis points. From my perspective, a very good operating performance despite reduced revenue and continued struggles in Europe.","With respect to backlog, the significant international order activity we expected in the first quarter had flipped to the right. We are still actively negotiating these transactions and have confidence they will close.","We expect Combat Systems revenue to improve steadily during the year quarter-over-quarter, but still fall short of the revenues guidance I gave you at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, operating margins will be better than my earlier guidance. Margins for the year should be in the range between 13.5% and 13.8%, but could be somewhat lumpy on a quarterly basis, depending on the timing of further restructuring charges in Europe.","Marine group. The Marine group continues to perform effectively. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue was up $21 million, 1.3%, and earnings and margins are down, as expected, as a result of the conclusion of the highly profitable T-AKE Program last year. In all other respects, program earnings held steady or are up slightly. Operating margins are at a respectable 9.8%. This group is expected to be highly consistent during the remainder of the year with respect to both revenue and operating margin.","At IS&T, revenue is up modestly, $7 million, but earnings are down against the first quarter last year on lower operating margins. This was as planned. The operating earnings at 7.6% represent a significant improvement over the fourth quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis, ignoring the charges. We are working diligently to pursue -- for improved margins and expects stronger margins in the second half of the year. Our order activity remains good with a book to bill of 1:1.","Let me conclude my remarks by saying we had a strong quarter. We beat consensus and, frankly, beat our plan. We're off to a good start, and our internal focus on operations is gaining traction.","I'll turn over the mic for a few minutes to Hugh Redd, and he can provide a bit more detail.","L. Hugh Redd","Well, thank you, Phebe, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to cover a few miscellaneous items before the question-and-answer period.","First, net interest expense was $23 million for the quarter versus $39 million in 2012. For 2013, we expect net interest expense of approximately $90 million, reflecting the full impact of the debt refinancing completed late in 2012. At the end of the quarter, we had only $165 million of net debt, down about $450 million from year end.","The effective tax rate was 30.7% for the quarter, which reflects the impact of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. For 2013, we still expect an effective tax rate approaching 32%.","Finally, with respect to pensions, we continue to expect cash contributions to the plans to approximate $600 million for 2013. The bulk of the funding is expected to occur in the second half of the year.","That concludes my remarks. And, Erin, I'll turn the time back over to you for Q&A.","Erin Linnihan","Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] Sue, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the Aerospace side, I was wondering, Phebe, if you could give us an update on the market demand as you're seeing it and really honing in on the 550 and 450 where backlog is today, and just color as you see demand going the rest of the year. I mean, how are you thinking about production in that context?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Joe, as you all know, our book to bill has been below 1:1. But I think this is important to understand, with respect to Gulfstream, that data can be misleading. It's the mix of orders that are important, and a significant, in fact, a preponderance of the order in this -- orders in this quarter were for the G550 and G450 where we need them. So we carefully watched that portion of the order book to determine production rates. We're solid for the year and have not made a judgment about next year's rate on these aircraft. To the extent the rate is down for next year on the 450, 550 and we have no reason to believe at the moment that it would be, but to the extent that it is, it will be overcome by increases in the 650 and 280. So in general, we are very comfortable with where we see our backlog and our new order activity.","Operator","And your next question comes from Carter Copeland, Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just -- I'm going to resist the urge to ask about the Aerospace margins and instead ask a bigger picture question, Phebe. You've now had another quarter under your belt here to do business reviews, think about what you want to do with the company from a strategic perspective. And I wondered if you might share with us your perspectives on risks and opportunities you've identified over the last quarter or how things are shifting in your mind, and just your general sort of high-level thoughts on what direction you want to take the company in.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Let me answer that by giving you sort of an overview of how I see our portfolio and businesses developing through the long-range planning process. Gulfstream will grow significantly in that timeframe, and their margins will have improved. Marine group will grow on increased revenue in submarine market throughout that period. IS&T has obviously significant margin opportunity. And for Combat, we have sufficient international interest to bridge to a more robust army spending when the army needs to recapitalize. So in general, I like where we -- I like the offsetting cyclicality that we have embedded into our businesses. And in all respects, we see a very clear way forward. Does that answer you?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, it does.","Operator","And your next question is from Jason Gursky, Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. One on the sequester and just generally talk about your thoughts on sequester. And then secondly, on cash deployments and update us there on your thought.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, I think that there is a enormous amount of specificity in the press about sequester and the machinations that are going on in Washington. So there isn't much specifics that I can add other than give you some clarity about our business. Getting the full year FY '13 funding bill was a major upside event for our planning. That said, the final sequester impacts by program have not been communicated to us by our customer. If I think about where, at least for 2013, we're likely to see some impact, it would be in Combat Systems' shorter-cycle programs. And that's why I think that revenue may be a touch softer than I had anticipated. But in general, we do not see sequester as a significant threat to '13. Most of our sales are in our backlog. Cash deployment. Thanks, Erin. I think about cash deployment in 3 basic buckets. Dividends -- and this is for this year, dividends, share repurchases and strengthening our balance sheet. In March, the board announced a 10% dividend increase, the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases that yielded a 3% yield. I think that was very wholesome. And with respect to dividends, what you need to expect from us is consistency, predictability and sustainability. I think that that's important. Share repurchases, you're going to see us, throughout the remainder of the year, act accordingly in shareholder-friendly ways with respect to share repurchases. And then given the charges in the fourth quarter, we need to strengthen our balance sheet a touch. I don't see any acquisitions on the time -- on my current time horizon, but that doesn't mean that there's something small and in our core that we wouldn't be interested in looking at it. But at the moment, I've got nothing, and that's fine. We continue to want to focus internally.","Operator","And your next question is from Yair Reiner, Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Well, I can't resist asking about the Aero margins. Can you talk about the puts and takes in the quarter? Obviously, a very strong performance there. And then how we should think about the trends sequentially for the balance of the year?","Phebe N. Novakovic","There were 2 primary drivers of our performance: one, Jet had a good quarter and made a good contribution in excess of their plan; and second, we made progress on the 650 manufacturing margins and dealing with the retrofit issues that we talked about during the last call. As we begin to smooth the transition between green deliveries and outfitting, we'll continue to see better margin improvement. So as I think through the year, it's premature to increase our guidance. We need to work through the remainder of our retrofit issues, which ought to clarify by the end of the second quarter. And with respect to Jet, they have remedied and fixed their underlying operational problems. The key there to a long-term value proposition is volume on completion. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about the quarter-over-quarter and for the year. We've got some upside, but we're not ready to declare it yet until we get through some of the retrofit issues, okay?","Operator","And your next question is from Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.","We'll take the next question from Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually, I thought I'd rather follow up on Joe's earlier question on Aerospace and the demand environment. I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing, particularly for the 450 and 550 and also, what your sort of lead time is for an order today, because I think in the past, you said you'd feel comfortable with an 18-month lead time on those jets.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Our pricing is holding up nicely on both the 450 and the 550, and we have sufficient visibility into the year to be very comfortable with our production rates. And as we move into next year, we've got to assess where we are in terms of the 450, 550. But today, we're very comfortable. So we're slightly underneath that, the window of 18 to 24 months, but not materially and not to any extent that would make us concerned. As I mentioned earlier, it's really the mix, and we analyze that portion of the backlog in order to determine our production rate. So, so far, it's steady as she goes.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Has there been any improvement on the G280 pricing?","Phebe N. Novakovic","We have some improvement as we begin to move that in -- that airplane into the market more robustly. We've got a fair amount of demand there, and we like where we are. G280 is generating an awful lot of interest as we expected it would.","Operator","And your next question is from Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Phebe, if we could go back to Jet for a moment, I'm wondering with all the restructuring there, if you can frame for us what the business looks like today, the mix of business between corporate jet MRO and completions and relative size versus what it looked like when you first acquired it and how that should then trend going forward so we have a better understanding of that -- how that's supposed to look.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Sure. So Jet is a smaller business than when we acquired it, primarily because we failed to integrate Jet in a timely fashion. We have now solved all of the underlying performance issues, particularly -- and not on the MRO side, but particularly on the completion side. So the mix of business going forward, there is -- this is how I think about it. There's always a fair amount of volatility, particularly in Europe, with respect to maintenance, and you saw that we restructured that maintenance business to reflect the demand. And so far, the demand for service is holding up fairly well, given our expectations. So going forward, the issue for us is completion both of the corporate jets and then the large-body and narrow-body major completion projects that we're perfectly capable of executing. And now that we've got the Gulfstream discipline embedded and inculcated throughout Jet, we're likely to perform very well on. So I'm optimistic about where Jet sits. [Indiscernible]. Go ahead.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was just going to say, is there a way to think about the mix of completions versus MRO? Since you bought the business, clearly, some of the other corporate jet manufacturers have gone elsewhere, but you still have your captive business, you still have the heavy Jet business. And so...","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, we do. And I think you'll see completions becoming a larger part of the backlog going forward, and that has addition -- I like that because we've got additional margin and cash-generation opportunities. So as a mix, we're likely to move more into completions and with the steady undercurrent and undergirding of service, which I -- the service industry or the service business, which I think we have rightsized appropriately.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","When do you think you'll hit your target margins there?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, I think we've got to bring in the -- some additional revenue. And when we do that, we'll -- probably in the next year or 2, we ought to be able to see some real upside.","Operator","And your next question is from Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Phebe, I wanted to try to dive into Combat a little further. Perhaps you can walk us through the major moving pieces that drove the larger-than-expected revenue decline in the quarter. And then when you sit back and look at the longer-term view on the segment, it's come down somewhat significantly off the peak, but is still a much, much larger business than it was a long time ago. When you consider all the different inputs to the scenario analysis, maybe you could share with us sort of a range of potential outcomes for where you think this business bottoms, given what could happen with sequestration and what you're expecting internationally, et cetera.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. So revenues for the quarter-over-quarter or the year, quarter -- first quarter '12 versus first quarter '13 were lower. But I have to tell you, that was well within our expectation. And with respect to both earnings and revenue, Combat Systems outperformed their plan. So our plan was built on a presumption of softer orders and sort of softer sales in the first quarter and then building through the year. I've -- I have factored in now the impact of sequestration into Combat estimates, and so we may see a touch lighter overall sales for the year, but not much. So I think we have stabilized with respect to our current order book. And the key for us is executing and delivering into our backlog some of the large international orders that we're continuing to work. Once we get those in, then it will be a little bit easier to give you some additional view and others some additional clarity around the long-term prospects. But Combat, we're not going to chase revenues, and I think I mentioned that to you all on the last call. And we will rightsize our business to the revenues that we have currently, hence, our good margin performance. What we'll promise you all is margin expansion and cash generation, and you got to meet market where the market is. That said, we haven't -- we have very, very nice and robust international orders that ought to bridge until the army begins to recapitalize.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just quickly, I guess, on the Combat is -- I just wanted to ask a question. You haven't explicitly said it, but I assume you're still comfortable with your current earnings outlook that you provided back in January. And when you say a touch lighter for Combat, what -- how does that vary to the minus 6% you talked about back in January? And then I just wanted a little clarification on the international order, because I thought it was really one order. But the way you referred to is multiple transactions. So can you help us think through some of what you're pursuing there?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Sure. We're looking at about -- perhaps around an 8% versus 6% decline for the year, and I'm very comfortable with that estimate. I think we derisked with respect to sequestration. If you recall, it was not part of sequestration, and the impact of it was not part of our original guidance. But operating margins are expected to be higher, and so it's going to leave us pretty much on track with respect to our operating earnings. The -- we have a series of transactions, international transactions that we're continuing to work the Ts and Cs on. And while I'm a little reluctant to give any specificity on when we expect to have them closed, we see no reason that they won't close. And hopefully -- and most probably, it'll be in the second quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","I wanted to pursue Gulfstream a little bit more, a little more detail. I assume there weren't any -- wasn't any forfeiture income this year and if you could compare the jet profit to what it was last year. And then I'm guessing the book to bill was above one, if you just looked at it for 450s and 550s. And then just if you could tell us how many 650 deliveries there were.","Phebe N. Novakovic","We had fewer defaults in this quarter than we did in the first quarter of '12, which then reduced our liquidated damages for this quarter, which is a good thing in my mind. The 450 and 550 continue to be at around 1:1. So we're comfortable in the quarter with where we are with respect to that. And your final question was -- remind me? 650. We're not going to give you breakouts on our large cabin, of what constituted the large-cabin sales by line. I don't think that that's healthy or helpful, because we end up in a giant variance analysis. But I will tell you that the preponderance of orders in the quarter, about 80% of them were in the 450, 550 for large cabin. So I hope that helps you.","George Shapiro","Yes. And then the other part of the question was how did Jet's perform compare to last year's first quarter, the completions business? How much better was it?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Outstanding. We were breaking even last quarter. And this quarter, we made considerable amount of money, so -- for Jet. So I'm very pleased with where they are [indiscernible] just to keep it going.","George Shapiro","You don't want to quantify considerable anymore?","Phebe N. Novakovic","No, sorry.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Phebe, on sequestration, you obviously talked about 2013 not much of an impact, because most is in backlog. It would look like you still got about 25% that you have to secure through the course of the year that could be subjected to sequestration, if you could comment on that. And then as we think about 2014, any initial thoughts on what we could be looking at in terms of a -- the revenue environment for the defense businesses, given sequestration?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Sure. First, for '13, I have given you my estimate of the impact from sequestration. While we haven't had a lot of specificity from our customer, what we've been able to see is we've got a touch softness in Combat. We -- but if you step back, both with respect to IS&T and almost the entirety of our platform businesses, the sales are in backlog. So '13 is looking solid, and I don't see much of a risk to that at all. With respect to '14, the President's Budget Request was good for us in several respects. All of our shipbuilding programs were well supported. And the support for Stryker, the double-V hull exchange over the next 5 or over the 5-year plan, was especially encouraging. Also, the army's communication network modernization appears to be budgeted at a higher level than it has in the past. So while there is no way to estimate the extent of sequestration or additional budget cuts, since who knows how that's all going to play out, but as we stand now, we like what we saw in the President's Request. And I'll tell you something. When I think back -- putting my old budgeteer hat on, there are 2 kinds of programs that tend to be impacted in a down environment, a revenue-constrained environment. Those are troubled programs and developmental programs. And in -- with respect to both, we are in very good shape. Our programs are all green, very, very good solid performance, and that's frankly the best antidote to the budgeteer's scalpel. And in addition, new starts, we are comfortable where we are in the programs that are moving from development into production. And so I've got to tell you, I think we're pretty well positioned. As I said, performance sells.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. So to get back to the Aerospace margins, I mean, pretty clearly, you had -- while you didn't give us the numbers, you're going to have had more deliveries in the 3 G650s you did, so you have had an adverse mixed shift. And just kind of backing through an estimate of the numbers, it looks like profitability would have been better year-over-year, the large biz jets. Maybe give us a little more color. Has that -- given you -- presumably you're in the midst of rework there on the G650, I mean, it looks either the 450 and 550 margins improved for the fourth quarter or the G650 was considerably better. Is that correct, and maybe...","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. Let me walk you through some of that. The 450 and 550 are mature programs that we're continuing to reap the benefits of process improvements. So our margins will continue -- they have increased and they'll continue to increase. With respect to the 650, we're moving down the learning curve in the green manufacturing process, which is exactly what we anticipated. And the uncertainty where we don't have great clarity yet is what is the running rate on margins and completions. But with respect to 450, 550, margins were better. And the 650, on the green deliveries, we're coming down that learning curve, very, very nicely. And then we'll stabilize going forward as we work that retrofit imbalance through the completions process.","Operator","And your next question comes from Peter Arment, Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. I guess my question was very similar to Cai's. I guess another way to characterize it is, I guess, when your rework in balance is completed in the second quarter, should we think that -- and not to get ahead of ourselves on margins, but the mix in the second half of the year should look better than the first? Is that fair?","Phebe N. Novakovic","We will build through the course of the year, yes. But I'm not -- I don't want to get you guys there until we've really worked through this retrofit, because there's still risk out there. We're confident that we'd work through the majority of it. No surprises. But until we rebalance green with completions, we're just not ready to give you a higher -- or change our guidance. We'll take a look at doing that at end of the second quarter.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. If I could just squeeze in one last one. Just on -- unrelated, but is -- what is left on the share buyback authorization?","L. Hugh Redd","9 point...","Phebe N. Novakovic","9-point-something million shares.","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Loomis, Stifel.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Phebe, so just to be clear, the $6.60 to $6.70 guidance you gave, which did not have sequestration in January, that that's post-sequestration and the impact, which you said is mostly some of portion of Combat, that now that would include sequestration?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. Because as I pointed out, the softness was in -- is in revenue, but our margins will expand in Combat. And so our earnings will be -- operating earnings are going to be right on mark.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then on the IS&T side, on some of the shorter-cycle-like services business, you don't see a sequestration impact or any pullback in business on that short-cycle services side?","Phebe N. Novakovic","No. And in fact, our services business is running better than 1:1 book to bill, and I like how they're positioned. Let me give you a little bit more color with respect to services. With -- for the most part, we find competition's very, very wholesome. But there's a phenomenon that's occurring in the service business that can be fairly troubling to the overall customer satisfaction, and that is competition for price. We were not going to be -- participate in a race to the bottom. In those instances where we don't believe there is sufficient price permitted in a particular bid or contract, we're going to walk away. We've done that on occasion, but continuing to provide our customer with very good services and products. And it's awful hard to do in an abnormally-constrained price environment. So in those instances where we can't live up to our promises, we're going to walk away. And I think that's appropriate and healthy.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- fine. Just a quick one on Combat. You said a portion of Combat is going to be impacted by sequestration. Obviously, not the longer cycle stuff. What -- can you just give us a little more detail on which -- what is that portion that might get impacted by sequestration that you're concerned about?","Phebe N. Novakovic","It's going to be in the shorter-cycle products, some that fluctuate with the demand for the war. Those tend to be more at risk if the supply is in excess of the demand. But as I say, it's not material and does not affect our overall performance and operating earnings.","Operator","And your next question is from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was -- I'm hoping you could give us some color maybe on the sequential pattern of revenue to the course of the rest of the year, just so we're on the same page. I think the top line is something we've been struggling with for a few quarters now. Maybe just to baseline what the profile, in particular, of Combat is through the course of the year to get to that $7.4 billion. And then secondly, Phebe, is it fair to think that you're now comfortable with the portfolio and with what sequestration's impact is so that share repurchase would really get restarted here with more aggressive fashion?","Phebe N. Novakovic","So with respect to Combat, we are, as I mentioned in the first quarter, above our revenue plan and our earnings. And what we had anticipated performing to throughout the course of the year was a building quarter-over-quarter of revenue. You may see some lumpiness in margins as we take the rest of our restructuring charges in Europe, but we'll see a nice solid build quarter-over-quarter. With respect to where we find ourselves in the cash and the balance sheet and the risk in the environment, as I said, we had anticipated a very light order for cash. It came in much stronger but toward the end of the quarter. Once we were comfortable that the cash was being generated, as we were anticipating toward the end of the quarter, then we ventured back into the market but fairly late in the quarter. So going forward, I think you can expect us to participate in share repurchases in a shareholder-friendly manner.","Operator","And the next question is from Ron Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe a bigger strategic question around Gulfstream. You had lot of questions, so far, on that. When you think about the 450 and 550 line. as you probably know, there's been some noise that there's been some discussion about updating those planes or replacing those planes with something. How do you think about that? I mean, when's the right time to do it? And -- I mean, if you can give us any color on how you think about that challenge.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, as you know, we, several years ago, instituted a fairly disciplined R&D program to refresh and replace our platforms, our airplanes as we move forward. We'll continue -- we are continuing that. And we will make announcements about any potential new planes when we're ready, when we know that with great certainty that we can give you clarity around what it is and, more importantly, when it'll be available. And that's -- and we're not there yet and I'm not going to speculate. I don't think that does anybody any good.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. No, sure. And then maybe just one last question. On the midsize right, this quarter you delivered 5 compared to 2 last year. Can you give any description around what Gulfstream is seeing in the midsize market? Is there any pickup? Is it just happen to be timing and a little bumpy and that's why we got more? What's going on there?","Phebe N. Novakovic","No. I'll tell you, the 280 is generating an awful lot of customer interest. It is a great airplane that fills that niche. And frankly, we're -- got very, very robust sales pipeline, and we like what we see. So I anticipate 280 is to grow throughout the year.","Operator","And your next question is from Howard Rubel, Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You resized the corporate staff, cut it by about 10%, and we've seen 1 or 2 other business units that have followed suit. Do you expect most of the other business units to take this mandate and run with it as well? I mean, could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what you're doing on the cost side to make the business more affordable?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Both at the corporate headquarters and throughout our businesses, each one of our businesses, we have an obligation to -- through a continuous improvement and some restructuring internally to drive costs out, and we've done that at the corporate headquarters and fairly significantly. Many of our business units are already in the process of undertaking efficiencies in their back-office functions, as well as in their production line. But overhead -- going after overhead is critical to margin expansion in a down environment. So you can believe -- you can better believe that we're going to be very, very focused on taking costs out. And we've done it, and we'll continue to do it.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on that. Does that lead to more business opportunities? And maybe you could highlight 1 or 2. Or does it end up just showing up on the bottom line?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, I think it's both. It clearly helps margins. But the extent to which you can bring down your prices, you're increasingly competitive. And we have done that across every one of our portfolios, across all of our portfolios in almost all of our lines of business. So I see cost cutting and continuous improvement efficiencies as central to our ability to win more business and increase our margins and, frankly, provide a superior product to our customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neal Dihora, Morningstar.","Neal Dihora - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess my question is more of long term. But I think GD is one of the few companies that sort of has headcount reductions over the last 5 years. And I guess -- just wondering if the next 3 to 5 years is going to be materially different from that perspective.","Phebe N. Novakovic","We reduce headcount in response to the business environment that we're faced with. So I certainly won't preannounce any restructuring, but you can rest assured that we will tackle our -- all aspects of costs as we go forward.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3583.","Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Rocco, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks, Howard. And good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We reported EPS of $3.14 per diluted share, $0.25 a share, better than the year ago quarter and $0.37 per share, better than the second quarter of this year. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $667 million or 7.3%. By the way, we have enjoyed top-line growth every quarter for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis.","Earnings from continuing operations of $913 million were up $49 million or 5.7% on a 7.1% improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower pension income. Operating margins return to the 12.5% level. Sequentially, revenue was up $206 million or 2.2% and operating earnings were up $126 million or 11.6% on higher operating margins. In short, we had significant sequential margin improvement. With respect to consensus, our margin rate was 40 basis points higher than forecasted by the South-side. This was offset in part by below the line items, leaving our EPS $0.07 better than consensus, the difference was provided by stronger operating earnings. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $1,091 million and free cash flow of $847 million. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a good quarter with a 1 to 1 book-to-bill.","Total backlog of $67.4 billion, decreased $258 million or about a third of 1%. I have more to say about order intake if I discuss the separate operating segments and Jason will give you some color about cash and backlog in his remarks. Let me turn very briefly, the year-to-date 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. Revenue was up $2.8 billion or 10.7% against the first three quarters of 2018, driven by strong organic growth, plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. To say it another way for clarity, CSRA attributed revenue was in every 2018 quarter, but the first. Operating earnings were up $89 million or 2.8% EPS was $0.31 better.","In short, we delivered good sequential improvement and a good first 9 months. As such, essentially, we are on track to our internal plan and external expectations. So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the year-to-date. First Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.5 billion was 23% higher than the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $393 million were $17 million or 4.5% higher on lower margins related to mix as fully expected. Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning -- concerning earnings and operating margin. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a strong third quarter last year with 18.5% operating margin against 15.8% this quarter. This Delta is driven only in part by mix. The third quarter of 2018 contained a positive non-recurring settlement with the supplier. On a sequential basis, the story is even better revenue was up $359 million or 16.8% and earnings were up $62 million or 18.7% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin; excluding pre-owned sales from both periods, results in a 70 basis point sequential improvement in Aerospace margin. The past quarter saw the first G600 deliveries and in the quarter. Over 30% of our large-cabin deliveries were comprised of new product which is notably higher than the second quarter 2019. So despite the challenges of mix, we are making good progress. We are focused on aligning our costs with our operating cadence.","The G600 earned both its Type and Production Certification on June 28, 2019. We have commenced deliveries and expect to approach double digit total this year. This will help both revenue and earnings in the balance of the year and improved working capital turns. EASA validation for the G500 was received on October 11 and the 600 validation is targeted for December 12. With respect to orders, we had a book-to-bill of 0.7 to one in the quarter. Activity and interest ranged between very attractive to robust, but the process and time to closure of transactions was slower. We expect as you would guess, a very strong order activity in the fourth quarter. You are undoubtedly aware of the announcement of the all new G700. The materials related to this program and its specifications are publicly available. It is an expansion of our product line, that brings advances in Avionics and Aerodynamics to create an industry leader. The G700 incorporates the new engines, new winglets and brand new avionics from the G500 and G600 series. The development of this plane is quite mature and we expect first flight in December. The announcement of the G700 have cleared up some of the mystery and has in some respects stimulated G650 discussions. All in all we are doing quite well at Aerospace.","Turning to Combat Systems. We had a good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicates. Revenue of $1.74 billion was up $217 million over the third quarter of last year or 14.2%. Similarly operating earnings of $264 million were up $23 million or 9.5% over the third quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, the story is similar revenue was up $81 million or 5% and operating earnings were up $22 million, a 9.1% increase. Combat Systems margins return to the 15 plus neighborhoods. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $538 million or 12% against the same period of 2018. However, operating earnings are only $11 million or 1.6% higher. Mix and a one-time settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter explain why profits is expanded more slowly than revenue. We expect a very good operating leverage in the final period of the year. I think it's worth noting the Combat Systems has enjoyed a year-over-year growth in the 11 of the past 12 quarters. Our existing US-based programs continue to perform well with Abrams volumes up strong Stryker business and nice growth in the Ordinance and Ammunition portfolio. In the advocate, our US government volume accounted for 57% of revenue year-to-date, compared with 49% in the first three quarters of 2018 underscoring this shift in mix. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming year is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the Tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Furthermore, we've recognize the Army set a high bar for the OMSD program and we are focused on delivering a superior solution to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.","Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the UK AJAX program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live fire testing has been successful and we entered into reliability testing in the third quarter of this year. We expect to enter steady state production this year and continue through 2024. Combat Systems enhanced their backlog this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3 to 1. The Government of Canada ordered 360 armored Combat Support vehicles to $1.3 billion. Work has begun on the program and we expect to begin deliveries in Q1 of 2021. ELX is negotiating the contract with the Spanish government to deliver the first tranche of 348 Piranha V vehicles. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement in all businesses in this segment. We are trending in the right direction at combat systems. Every one of our businesses in this segment is on the move. With respect to the marine group, revenue of $2.24 billion was $232 million or 11.6% higher than in Q3 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $40 million or 23.7% against the year ago quarter, due in part to the progress to closing out Virginia-class Block III and better year-over-year earnings at NASSCO. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $19 million due to timing, operating earnings were up $12 million. For the first three quarters of the year, revenue of $6.6 billion was up $413 million or 6.7% against the same three quarters of 2018. Operating earnings were $38 million better on a 10 basis point improvement in margin rate. ","Similar to Combat Systems, the marine group has enjoyed year-over-year growth in 9 of the past 10 quarters. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia-class construction and engineering on Columbia Ballistic-Missile Submarine continues to make good progress. We have completed the design of Columbia and are 54% complete on the production drawing, which reflects good progress. Virginia-class Block IV work remains steady, volume has been driven by early work on Virginia Block 5 and Columbia. We expect the Block 5 applied contract to be awarded this year, resulting in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG 1,000 Ship and the DDG-51 Restart Ships are behind us with nice performance on the 1,001 and 2 and the follow-on DDG-51 Ships. We have 11 DDG-51 ships in backlog with a very good opportunity to prefer improve performance steadily across this large backlog. Finally, revenue at NASSCO, for the quarter was up due to higher repair volume.","Similarly, year-to-date volumes were up due to higher repair and work on the TAO Class Oiler program. We also expect the first two Matson ships in the ESB 5 to deliver in the fourth quarter. In all, the Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. Our focus going forward is operating efficiency and margin improvement over this very large backlog. For Mission Systems; Mission Systems had revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter, flat with the year ago results. Earnings of $187 million were up $6 million against the third quarter last year. Margins were an impressive 60 basis points higher. Sequentially, margins of 15.2% were up on even more impressive 250 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $190 million or 5.2%. Earnings for the 9 months were up $17 million versus the first 9 months of June of last year.","Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1 to 1 in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and stands above 1 to 1 at the three quarter mark in 2019. Its business have been broad base reflect its capabilities in space, communication and sophisticated command and control solutions. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down $236 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment. Operating earnings were $146 million, down $11 million despite a modest improvement in margin rates. The results were somewhat lower than expected as the company entered into a termination settlement related to its exit of a non-core line of business. Absent that charge, earnings and margin would have been more appropriately reflected or would have more appropriately reflected the progress we have made in combining CSRA with GDIT. Our integration of CSRA and GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule.","Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergies and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good booking. In the quarter, we generated $2.38 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2 to 1 for the 9 months, our book-to-bill was 1.2 to 1. Our 9 months bookings for 2019 are nearly 80% higher than those captured during the first three quarters of 2018. Our total backlog of $9.16 billion is up 15% from the start of the year. The strong order activity comes in the face of a protracted procurement cycle. GDIT has close to a billion dollars in awarded contracts that have been delayed by protests and over half of the $65 billion in outstanding awards that the customer had expected has slipped to the right. The underlying metrics of this business remains solid, cash flow continues to be strong. GDIT generated robust free cash flow to imputed net income up over 190% this quarter, despite controlled investments and customer infrastructure and restructuring expenses. So to offer a summary on the performance of all of the defense businesses, operating earnings have grown over 8% in the quarter on a nearly 3% advance in revenue.","Excluding the divestiture of the call centers business, the organic growth rate for revenue and operating profit are about 1 to 2 points higher. Book-to-bill for the defense operations was 1.1 to 1 in the quarter. Orders are just shy of $8 billion on a revenue of $7.72 billion for the quarter. For the 9 months defense bookings have essentially kept pace with the approximately 8% in revenue growth. So I don't think I have any changes to make with respect to our prior guidance. We seem to be right on track with the comprehensive outlook I gave you last quarter. And finally in closing and as tempting as it may be at this time a year for you to ask about next year, let me just remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you in January as of last January is grounded in that process, and as a result will be full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from the end of tail in January and our customers for many, many years.","Let me turn over the call to our CFO, Jason Aiken.","Jason Aiken ","Thank you Phebe and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in 2019 is due primarily to the debt we issued at the end of the first quarter of 2018 to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We've also been carrying a higher than anticipated commercial paper balance through the first 9 months as we continue to work to resolve an outstanding receivable balance on one of our large international vehicle programs, that's been outstanding since the fourth quarter of last year. As Phebe mentioned, our cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion and our free cash flow was $847 million a 93% conversion rate. The cash performance in the quarter reflected some progress on the international receivables I just mentioned. That said, we still have work to do to resolve the balance of the arrears.","We're continuing to work this issue with the customer and expect to have the matter resolved by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year we still expect full year free cash flow conversion to be well in excess of 100% of net income. Notwithstanding the progress made in the quarter, cash flow continued to be impacted by OWC growth at Gulfstream for reasons you now know and at Electric Boat. EB has been operating under an Un-definitive Contract Action or UCA, on the fifth Virginia-class Block, as we continue to work with the Navy to get that effort under contract. Until we get that contract executed our progress billings are temporarily limited.","We expect that situation to unwind with the receipt of the Block V contract in the fourth quarter. On the Capital Deployment front, capital expenditures were $244 million in the quarter or 2.5% of revenues, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We also paid $295 million in dividends in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $974 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.7 billion. We expect to use our free cash flow to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. In addition, we have a tranche of fixed and floating rate notes maturing in the second quarter of next year. So our focus in the moment beyond internal investment and the dividend will be repaying this debt. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2% reflecting greater foreign tax benefits than previously expected, driven by the strength of our international operations. With a rate of 17.5% for the first 9 months, we are lowering our anticipated full year tax rate by 50 basis points to the mid-17% range.","As a result of current market conditions, we've adjusted our assumptions for pension costs and recognized in the third quarter, an increase in the expense associated with our non-qualified plans. The impact of the increased pension expense and a lower tax rate I just discussed, offset each other relative to our full year outlook. And one last point of color on the backlog at the end of the quarter, specifically at Combat Systems, we continue to experience a drag on that groups backlog balance due to the FX impact of the strength of the US dollar, Specifically, Combat Systems has experienced a reduction in backlog of more than $400 million in the first 9 months of the year. Despite this headwind, the Group's backlog remains very strong at more than 2 times annual sales. Howard that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Howard Rubel","Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up question so that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Good morning. Phebe, wanted to one, touch on the G700 and how that potentially impacts the prior guidance that you've given, with regard to Gulfstream where I believe you've talked about EBIT growing a little bit in '20, but then growing significantly in '21, and margins approaching the high double-digit range again. How is the G700 all factored into that?","Phebe Novakovic","So in -- no, because we expect the entry into service, several years out. But, but I think it might be opportune just to remind you guys how we're really thinking about the portfolio of our airplanes in our operating strategy. So, as you know, we've had a plan for the past several years to bring down the 650 production and increased 500 and 600 and we're doing that completely independently of the 700. We've been pretty voluble about the fact that G650 production and deliveries will be reduced next year and again the following year, so that will get production and delivery consistent with current demand. And on that score, we've had a very consistent order book for the 650 over the past three to four years. And as you know, we've had the benefit of a large backlog we've been able to work down over time. So listen, to be clear, this has nothing to do with the 700 launch announcement is a planned long ago. Our job is to balance the loss revenue and earnings from the planned reduction of G650 deliveries with an increased flow from 500 to 600 to keep earnings stable. If by the way, the state with that risk but it comes with ample opportunity, and as I said, this has been the consistent plan, and it remains our plan. And then as the G700 enters into service that will then become another factor in our long-range, in our earnings and revenue growth.","David Strauss","Okay. I guess just asking a different, different way the -- that prior guidance that you've given for Gulfstream for '20 and '21, does that still hold?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, I don't think we've given guidance per se, but we've indicated that we'll continue to grow our top line and our bottom line, as we've made that this making this transition. I think the bottom line will be a little , a little bit slower growth simply because we are managing that transition from the 650 to the 500 and 600 but look, our idea is to stabilize earnings with this, with this transition and we've done that and we'll continue to do that. So I think when you think about the business going forward, this is the strategy that has driven our behavior today and driving it and we'll drive that on a going forward basis so that will form how you're thinking about our performance going forward.","David Strauss","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes, thanks good morning Phebe. Just a follow-up, just a question on the G700 you've always talked about the kind of dedicated production for the G500, G600 you started dedicated production facility with the G650. How should we think about that with the G700 is that going to be feathered in? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Well, it won't necessarily be feathered in. But to your question about, do we have a dedicated production facility in line? We do! See to expect that type of learning that we've seen on our other platforms. On the 700 as we come down our learning curve increased production and come down our learning curve that's all post-driven by the result of both our operating efficiency as well as our dedicated line.","Peter Arment","And just as a follow-up related to that on the order front, I know you mentioned you expect healthy orders in the fourth quarter here, and you've had a book-to-bill over 1 for the 9 months year-to-date. How are you approaching the book to -- the bookings for the G700 is it following a similar path to the G500 and 600? Thanks.","Phebe Novakovic","Yeah, as I think you know, we've announced we've got a nice robust backlog for the 700, and as I said, our fourth quarter, we expect to have even better and improved order activity increased order activity across our portfolio. By the way, we had more orders this year as again this quarter as against the quarter, third quarter of 2018. But in our that's compared against a 23% increase in revenue. This is a good quarter for us.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much and Phebe congratulations on the G700 it looks terrific.","Phebe Novakovic","Thanks Cai.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. You've indicated, I guess, first delivery in 2022, given that you're fairly close to first flight. Any -- will your comment, is the hope to be in the earlier part of the year or the latter part of the year?","Phebe Novakovic","So look, we've, I think we're comfortable in the -- in the estimate of certification that we've given you. And we've looked through the prism as we thought about going forward, we look through the prism of the current regulatory environment, but you well know, even better than we do. And so we have factored that into our thinking. If that happens earlier that's great.","Cai von Rumohr","Got it. And then I guess some industry sources suggest that you had been showing this plan for some time under NDAs. Were there any firm orders included in your bookings in the third quarter for the G700.","Phebe Novakovic","We had some bookings on this airplane, that's all I'm going to say on that score. This airplane is going to be very popular with that particular market segment.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Jon Raviv of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hi, thanks very much. Bigger picture question, bigger picture question for you guys actually. Section on capital allocation decisions across the businesses certainly appreciate, Jason, that the focus through first half of '20 is on the payment of debt. Just sort of thinking about, how should we think about things going forward and how you make those allocation decisions across the businesses?","Jason Aiken","You know, John, I don't think we would really articulate any fundamental change to our long-standing approach to capital deployment as it as those priority stand internal investment first, where we have profitable opportunities for returns, followed by the steady and predictable dividend and then it really is about M&A were attractive accretive and in our core opportunities exist and share repurchase, but it and between that as you articulated for the moment the prioritization really is all about getting that debt pay down at least through the first half of next year. Once we get to that point, we'll roughly pay down half of the, the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition will have the commercial paper balance behind us and will have a chance to look forward. But I don't think in terms of prioritizing those various avenues for capital deployment anything on that score has changed for us.","Jon Raviv","Thank you. And then just a follow-up on GDIT perhaps Phebe you had mentioned that some of the dynamics are stretching out then is obviously a pretty heavy protest environment out there. Is there any thoughts about the acceleration previously pointed to heading into heading into next year in the context that peers generally doing mid-single digits, should we expect GDIT to take market share in that environment? Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","So GDIT has been taking market share. I mean if you think about their performance, the performance to set underlying for underlies their outcomes since the acquisition. We've got a 75% --70%, 75% win rate for the trailing 12 months. I mean, that is consistent month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and as you all know, the book-to-bills and 1.2, 1.1 to do you have different year-to-date. So look, we are, we are winning and more than our fair share, but we have seen a protraction. I mean that's a significant amount of money for our contracts be tied up in -- in protest at around $1 billion. Now protests as you all know historically resolved to the benefit of the winner, so we are quite comfortable that that historical precedents will remain. But we've also seen a slowing and the execution of the contract awards and we suspect that will resolve through the course of next year and our rate of growth will be in part and no small measure driven by the increased rate in award volume. So nothing is systemic here. It's really a question of timing.","Jon Raviv","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Myles Walton of UBS, please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks Howard. I'm just wondering Jason, maybe you can give is a little bit more color on the cash flow and in particular, the Canadian advance, was in the numbers this quarter, and also just give is a boundary condition, if you don't make further progress on the Saudi lab. How does that play into the 3.5 billion implied free cash flow for the first quarter?","Jason Aiken","Yes, sure. So, yes, in fact the advanced we received in the quarter is in the numbers that you've seen. So that's in the 90% conversion rate for the quarter. As it relates to the balance of the year, I think the way to think about it is we came into the year with just over $1 billion of arrears from the fourth quarter of last year. That's grown somewhat call it another half a billion dollars through the balance of this year and so that's what we're after right now that's what's currently outstanding. I think you can see in our disclosures, there is an un-billed total, un-billed investment somewhere in excess of $2 billion, $2.5 billion. But that's not necessarily what's factored in here. It's really between $1.5 billion that we're still working to resolve before the end of the year.","Myles Walton","Okay and Phebe that marine margin I think is the best in a number of years. Just curious, is there anything one time and I know you didn't update the full-year projection, but let me just give us a little color to start of the year. I think you said that's the segment that had the most upside opportunity. And does this is this that coming through?","Phebe Novakovic","So what you saw here was the strong and successful finish of Block 3. I mean Block 3 is largely done and that performance and the strong closing of that contract, really drove our margins, but as you all know margins in this business in particular Electric Boat have followed the same path for 18 years. We start a new block and because of the contract structure with our customer they receive some of the benefits of our prior improvements on the previous block and then we reset the bar and come back down our learning curves and that's where we really are on Block IV. But Block III is largely behind us and they -- and they've closed out very well.","Myles Walton","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning everyone. I know I just coming back to the Gulfstream margins. I want to try to ask a question about the progression there because I know there's a lot of investor focus on it. First, please just further the last quarter of the year. If I take the guidance that you had previously provided. Literally, it would imply, it's down sequentially in the fourth quarter. So you're expecting that. And then I had interpreted prior comments to suggest expansion but modest expansion in 2020 because you're feathering 650 lower and you're still early in the 500, 600 ramp. But then, a larger degree of expansion in '21 as you further along in both of those processes. Do I have that correct?","Phebe Novakovic","So look, as you would imagine for a. for a business that has demonstrated the curve operating leverage year in year out on older models, the newer models Gulfstream will continue to march on margin improvement on a going forward basis. Don't forget that pre-own carries no margin. So to the extent that you've got a -- an implied lower margin in the fourth quarter, that's almost entirely reflected by by the pre-owned. As you well know just has no margin and is included in revenue, so there you have it.","Noah Poponak","And am I directionally correct on the beyond 2019 comments?","Phebe Novakovic","Well, I think we've been pretty consistent all along that this business is going to get better and better over time. That's about what we're going to say at this juncture.","Noah Poponak","And the will the G700 be the highest margin airplane in the portfolio, once it's at full-rate production?","Phebe Novakovic","We are so not going there. So look, you can imagine that we do well on our airplanes because we don't compete on price and we have a, unerring commitment to cost reduction and cost optimization, every quarter, every month, every quarter we get better.","Operator","And our next question today comes from George Shapiro Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Good morning.","Phebe Novakovic","Hi, George.","George Shapiro","Hi, your comment about the Q4 margin being lower from higher preowned. I mean, this quarter, it looks like there was for pre-owned for about $90 million. So you have would have earned 16.3% margin on the zero for the pre-own. Are you suggesting the fourth quarter is going to have higher pre-owned and I would have thought we're kind of through the G500 block. So that the fourth quarter margin would still be above the third quarter?","Jason Aiken","So, George taking your premises in reverse order, you're right about the progression on the underlying manufacturing improvements and I think that's what Phebe was alluding to earlier, we'll continue to see that progress quarter-on-quarter for Gulfstream. But yes, it's your first premise, based on the inputs we're seeing right now and the contracts that will deliver in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see at this point more pre-owned aircraft sales in the fourth quarter.","George Shapiro","And Jason that will more than offset the fact that the 500 through its initial block. So the margin should step up some in the fourth quarter?","Jason Aiken","I mean, I don't know that I want to piecemeal it down to that level. Those are two of the many inputs that go into the margins at Gulfstream in any quarter, when we've talked about this many times in the past. There is varying R&D levels, there's different mix of aircraft deliveries in all the different inputs the Jet Aviation service margins and so on. So I think we've articulated a couple of those discrete ones that are clear at this point, but the implied fourth quarter there is a couple of people who are picking up on is, as usual, a blend of a whole myriad of factors. So I think the most important point here for the long-term investor is the steady regular improvement in the operating cadence and margin of the production of the airplanes at Gulfstream.","George Shapiro","And just a clarification for you, Jason. The advance you got this quarter for -- from Canada. Was that just for the new Canadian contract or was there also some from the Saudi receivable?","Jason Aiken","That is strictly related to our relationship with the Canadians. On the new program.","George Shapiro","On the new program. Okay. So when you commented in the third quarter you expected to get some cash in August and in the balance by the end of the year, you were really just referring to this new contract, which obviously hadn't been announced at that point?","Phebe Novakovic","Well that's set we had anticipated that we would get this contract award and there would be an attendant along with that. That is one separate and distinct issue. As you all know, our international, the payments on our international program out of Canada have remained slow. Let me just remind everybody, there is no dispute on quantum, there no dispute on the fact that it is owed. It's simply a question of timing and we are still hopeful that we resolve that by the end of the year, but two distinct elements. Okay?","Operator","Our next question today comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you. You've sort of touched this little bit Phebe but can you elaborate on the comment you made, when you said the G700 has stimulated G650 discussions what you mean by that. And then the second part and I'm done here is, any thoughts on the tariff situation in Europe. Have you heard any concerns from your customer looks like this are going to be exempt, but any any rumblings about that over there? Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","So an inverse order, none on the tariffs and in fact ex-US business continues to be very fulsome. But let's talk a bit about the 700 and frankly the introduction of the 700 clarifies the 650 and let me give you a little bit of an explanation on why and talk to you about what the 700 is and what it is not. The G700 is in a slightly different market space, but in the same market segment as the 650. It is not a competitor. It is an alternative. It is not a replacement for the 650. Customers very clearly understand that and their buying decisions are motivated by a host of factors idiosyncratic and individual factors including the missions they fly, the ramp size, the makeup of the rest of their fleet. So I think it has clearly an ARM in our experience the 700 is clarified the 650 and been helpful.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","And Rocco this is Mr. Rubel -- This will be our last question.","Operator","Thank you, sir.","Robert Spingarn","So Phebe, I wanted to go to GDIT and just talk about the margin progression. You talked about some of the expenses in the quarter a pressure on the margins in the quarter, but otherwise would be higher. If we go back to your prior guide, I think that indicates a pretty robust fourth quarter, so could we talk about that and what normalized margins look like? And then just for a follow-up. Jason, I hear you on the cash deployment and retiring the debt, but given interest rates might it not make sense to look at the share buyback here just doing the math? Thank you.","Phebe Novakovic","But we're comfortable with our leverage and we're going to pay down that debt and we historically have never taken out debt to buy stock. So all sorts of reasons but we have discussed over the years. But look, GDIT margins were consistent with what we anticipated minus this one-time charge as we exited a line of business that we have inherited with CSRA. I don't think I need to remind you because I know you understand this that -- their EBITDA margins are industry-leading so their margin performance will continue to improve.","Howard Rubel","This is Mr. Rubel. Thank you very much for the call today and thank you everybody else for joining us. As a reminder, you should refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and the highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you sir. Today's conference has now concluded.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Erin. Good morning, all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 for fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion and income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus.","Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase, and income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase.","This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter that we've had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.","Sequentially, revenue is up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are essentially flat and operating margin is down 20 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is off $540 million, a 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year.","I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to Aerospace, as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date.","With respect to cash, we have $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% of net income from continuing operations.","In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of 1.5 million options. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts and somewhat in excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year.","As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and spent $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we have spent $2.2 billion on share repurchases and dividend year-to-date compared to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these two years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash.","As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments, with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded.","Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue is down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter of 2015, in line with the production cuts to the G450, G550 and, to a lesser extent, the G280, that we had previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest ever revenue quarter.","On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest ever margin for the group.","On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but a $3 million improvement in operating earnings and 140 basis point improvement in margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1%, a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin.","On the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measure in dollar value of orders. Gulfstream alone was about 1:1 on a dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on a number of units basis.","The distribution of these orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discrete third quarter since 2011 for orders.","Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue is off $15 million but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin.","On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million and operating earnings are flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year, and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue.","All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved. Our competitiveness positions us well for the future and through rest of the year, by the way. We continued to see opportunities for growth both internationally as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats and domestically as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment.","The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion.","Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million are down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis in the quarter as a result of a onetime charge at Bath on their restart of the DDG 115 and DDG 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well.","IS&T, well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.","Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarter. Year-to-date operating earnings are up $75 million, an 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T.","So, what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well, stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate and modestly lower share count enabled us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operation goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance.","And finally in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when these businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which we give to you in January, is grounded in that process and as a result, it's full and thorough. So, I don't want to prematurely piecemeal at this juncture.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations. Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in potential risk to the company.","In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy including the release of some rights to the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we've progressed through the ship building process, we've determined that the cost associated with this settlement is greater than the parties anticipated. Therefore, we recognized an $84 million loss net of taxes to adjust the previously recognized settlement value.","As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015 but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter.","Moving on to interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long term notes, our net debt position remains unchanged from the end of the second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion.","We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plan as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million.","Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range.","Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Chelsea, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Phebe, just a quick question. I know you don't want to get into much detail on 2017. But if I just rewind a little bit, I think in the past, you mentioned a goal, a longer-term goal of getting to double-digit earnings growth. If we think about the margin performance that the company has done this year, how should we think \u2013 is double-digit a reasonable starting place for 2017 when we think about where earnings could go?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Wow, so much for not getting into 2017. Look, we have, as a goal, double-digit growth, but it's too soon for me to tell how 2017 plays out. So, if you want to ask another question, go ahead.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Okay. So, thank you for that. So, maybe just a","follow-up on \u2013 in the quarter, you mentioned that sales at Gulfstream were good, right? And you have book-to-bill of 1 or over 1, depending on how you want to measure it.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Order. Yeah.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you give maybe a little more color on kind of regional distribution and how G650 was doing? Because as you know, there has been worry about sales of G650s, that kind of thing.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think it's worth stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market, and let me try to give you some insight into our market.","Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, including somewhat at Gulfstream, right? So, the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition, discussed with you previously during our transition from the G450 and G550 to G650 or G550 and G600 or G500 and G600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demands.","So, it would appear that we have been taking share from others in our space and as the G500 and G600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about \u2013 not about share but really about profit, but it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So, I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how our position going forward will help you.","It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, any one particular region outside North America. And our demand, consequently, has not been as perturbative as others have seemed to be. So, it gives you a sense of I think where we stand in the market and how we see it in general.","Now, let's dig down a little bit deeper into Gulfstream, and let's just think about this. So, from a Gulfstream perspective, again as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in five years and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and the pipeline are good.","If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timeliness of the certification. The G600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in 2019.","So, why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests and should be certified and entered into service in 2017, as implied by what we've just talked about. The G600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service, and all are on schedule with some forward bias.","Thinking about, again, just broadly, our market in Gulfstream in particular, I've always been of the view that a new plane needs 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production to have a good start. Well, the G500 is going to exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider that our sales force has been incentivized to focus on the G450 and G550. They'll now be incentivized to turn their attention towards the G500.","So, with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a little bit about where we are in the used market. We see, in the G650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, but as we deconstruct and analyze those potential aircrafts, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So, that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some \u2013 203, actually, G650s that we've got into service, and we haven't seen any impact this quarter on our new order activity or our order activity from the used market.","And with respect to the G550, the used market is about 7% of the 700 or so aircraft in service and so, we haven't been affected by that either. So, I notice that was rather a soliloquy, but I think your question about the distribution of our market I think was particularly just \u2013 gave me an opportunity to talk to you guys a little bit more fulsomely about the market. So, I hope that helped.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That does. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Phebe, I guess following up on that. You've talked about Gulfstream EBIT holding flat through this transition period. Is that still the official line given the pull forward on the \u2013 it sounds like a bit of a pull forward on the G500 and G600 and with the G450 going out of production?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, you're quite right. We said that we're going to try \u2013 we intended to keep earnings as flat as we could and the margins as high as we could during this transition period just to be a bit cyclical and frankly, so far, I think we've done a pretty good job. We'll get into 2017 after we set our production rates and got a little more clarity into the market, but that still remains our goal to give you those higher earnings as we possibly can and margins as high as we can.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Quick, quick follow-up. Marine \u2013 how much was the charge of Marine on the quarter?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","It's not material.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","But I wanted to mention it to you so you just at least understood what was going on.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and congratulations. Terrific performance at Gulfstream.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Thanks, Cai.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Can you explain to me, I mean, for the deliveries that you made, which were pretty much in line where we were guessing, we had less profit by $30-million-plus. So, was it lower R&D? Was it supplier payments? Was it forfeitures? Was it better margins? What got you to a number that strong and is that likely to repeat in the fourth quarter?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, as we've talked before, Aerospace margins and Gulfstream, in particular, are variable quarter-over-quarter. But what you're seeing here is a result of the Gulfstream team doing a superb job taking costs out as their revenue has declined. And they've done a very good job at that in the quarter. R&D was somewhat lower. We had some timing issues at Jet Aviation. I don't anticipate that performance going forward in margins, but they will continue to do quite well.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick one on how you think about the transition to the G500, G600 from a margin or a cost standpoint, I guess. Clearly, it's come out that you'll end the G450 production in 2018, and you just made a comment about the contribution you expect from the G500 and G600 and how that layers in, in 2017 and 2018. But with those aircraft being produced in different facilities, how should we think about the ramp down on the G450, and then eventually the G550 and how that impacts the overall cost structure of the segment? Thanks.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Okay. We've talked the last year or so about how we're going to manage the transition as we wind down the G450 and G550 and then bring on the G500 and G600. And the key there is matching the shipsets, the wings, the fuselage, the engines with the number of airplanes that we have left to sell or left to deliver. And so far, with the G150 for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the G450 and I expect the same thing on the G550. So, I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable.","That said, as we, look, think about it. Any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream's going to have, right. You're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic learning curves, as we enter and start to produce and deliver G500s and G600s. But I will tell you, if you look at the G650 by comparison, and let's just use that as our baseline, the G650 margin performance was faster and higher than the G550 before it. So, that means it's coming down its learning curve and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever before.","So, the lessons that we have learned on the G650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the G500 and G600, and that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going hit the ground running. They have some margin compression as we begin to deliver, as we come down those learning curves, but our ability to come down those learning curves as we've demonstrated, I believe is going to go much, much faster. And remember too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the G500 and G600. So, I suspect that the ignition coming down, when we bring that G600 into full wave production, it's going to be pretty impressive.","I got to tell you, I like where we are. I like where we're headed. We're moving through this transition period like I told you we were going to do, and we're in good shape for real revenue and earnings growth as we get these two new airplanes into service.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Phebe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I wanted to ask you about Combat Systems. You made a comment about the sequential growth you're going to see in the fourth quarter. And just to get to your annual guidance, you do need something like a 35% sequential increase. So, can you talk a little bit about what drives that?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Sure. So, the fourth quarter revenue increase is driven primarily by a couple of things. The Canadian, Mid East order and our AJAC programs as they move from engineering and low rate production in the third quarter into full rate production in the fourth quarter. So you're going to see some real \u2013 and by the way, we got this \u2013 Combat has this analyzed down to a fine level of detail, and we have that growth in our backlog and we are positioned on both of those programs. So those are going to drive it primarily. But recall also Combat tends to have very robust revenue growth in the fourth quarter across the portfolio, and we'll continue to see that in OTS and ELS as well as Land Systems. So, there isn't much ambiguity this late in the year with the group that really understands their products and how they're going to then begin to execute.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And if I can follow-up a question just in terms of the other Mid East Abrams order that Congress has been pushing back on. Is there a certain timeframe when","that has to come in until it starts to affect your production?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, I'm not sure why you think they're pushing back on it. Frankly, they approved. If you're talking about the 100, in September, they approved the 133 M1A2 Saudi Main Battle Tank request, so that's good to go, it at contract.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","All right.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. Thank you. Phebe, I'm curious about that comment you made about the sales force having their incentives change around the new programs slipping to the G500 and G600 from the G450, G550. Can you help me understand a little bit how, first of all, when that happened? And how material of a change is this in their own lives? Is this like a significant driver of their compensation structure? Or is this a small thing in their bonus? I'm just kind of trying to think about ...","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well look, I'm not going to get into how we pay them.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","No. I don't want to know how much money they make, but just...","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","But to give you a sense, just in general it's the case here is that the sales force is incentivized to sell whatever products we, at the moment, are focused on. And so their bonuses are a significant part of their compensation and it's up to us to give them the direction of where we're going have them focus. So, this has been a very effective sales force as I think you can see from our order activity.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Oh, sure. Did this change within the last few months? Or has this been in there for six, nine months, something like that? Or is it just like something a change effective at the end of the year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, look, think about it. The G450 we've announced \u2013 that line is going to end, surprisingly, right? These replacement aircrafts, by definition, are going to replace airplanes that we're winding down and the G550 has continued to have very nice order activity. So, we're pretty confident that it's time now to move more robustly to the G500. And let me tell you, even incentivized as they were, as I mentioned in my remarks, we have sold quite a few. So, we're in pretty good shape here.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Hi, Phebe. I'm so inclined to ask a Gulfstream question, but you've answered them all.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Oh, go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","No. I won't do that. Instead, talk a little bit about Information Systems and Technology. I mean, you've stated that there has been a change and it's sort of taking on your growth profile. Can you elaborate a little bit upon what some of the pillars are that are behind this and how you'd like to shape it going forward?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","All right. Let me kind of take that in two parts. And let's start with our book-to-bill because I think that that reflects a lot of different moving parts. In the quarter, we had a book-to-bill about 0.8:1, and that's solid for this short-cycle business. And think about it in terms of the last eight quarters, or eight of the last 11 quarters for this group have had a 1:1 or greater book-to-bill, which is really quite exceptional in the short term for short, these highly transactional businesses.","So, that gives us the platform for some of this ignition. And in terms of where we're focused, on our platform side, we've got a number of growth opportunities across our platform portfolio. In our ISR business and space payload markets, cyber, nuclear weapons and avionics. So, I like where they are there.","On our IT side, we have had nice book-to-bills, and we've got a number of wins that we've had across the entirety of the portfolio. And I'll tell you, if you remember, we also have the census in there, which would be a nice cost plus award fee program for five years, and we like how that fits into our low risk cash generating portfolio.","And then going forward, we've got an awful lot of competitions coming up, and we tend to","announce those as we win them or we put them into our backlog. So, the diving board for our growth is there in our backlog, and because these businesses have really reduced their cost and increased their competitiveness, their book-to-bill has been wholesome for quite some time now and I expect it to be going forward.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","And then actually, I do want to, as a follow-up, you know if you do the flight hours on the G500, you're clearly ahead of schedule. Can you provide us a little bit of an indication of when you think in the first half of 2017 you might get the cert?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","I think first half is a touch ambitious, but I'll be able to give you in January a lot more clarity when we get the full certification timeline from the FAA. But I'm very confident we're going to cert in 2017.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask on Marine, on the Ohio Class Replacement Program, because the scale of that program is so large that one would expect it to transform Electric Boat in the next decade, and particularly if we see Virginia class stay stay at two per year.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","That's my view.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, when you look at it \u2013 can you talk about the general trajectory of revenues and earnings over the next five years as you move toward the first ship? And also, what investments might be needed to really set Electric Boat up for the scale of operations that will ultimately be there?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","All right. Let me give you a little bit \u2013 because this is such a big program, let me give you a little bit of detail on what's going on, on the Ohio Replacement. We have had the design contract now for about five years, and we're proceeding nicely apace. As you know, we're the prime contractor for the design but not the sole contractor, and the prime contractor for the construction.","So, our schedule is right on point to start the conception of the lead ship in 2021, and I would imagine that \u2013 well, I expect that our profile on revenue between now and 2021 where we'll really begin to see the real ignition, will be driven by a couple of things.","One, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio, which will begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer. But starting perhaps in 2019 \u2013 I think we're anticipating 2019 \u2013 we're likely to see long lead production, so we can actualize the ship production construction in 2021. So, as you know, these submarine programs take \u2013 require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule.","So, to give you a sense of where we in the design and the component development. Well, we have proposed a detailed design and, actually, all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer, and they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year.","And you know what, when you think about these large nationally strategic programs, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the costs are well understood. And so one of the things that's been driving our work the last three years is a bottom-up analysis of the full cost of construction. So that'll be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","When you look at Electric Boat though, this will really change what the operations look like up there. I mean, how do you think about planning for that?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well look, I'm sorry, you did ask that, my fault. We have begun making the investments over the last five years. The investments are primarily funded by the Navy, but we will also and have been putting some of our capital in and will continue to because, well look, we invest in lines of business that have high returns for us and good returns for us and this is one of those lines of business, and it is transformative. You put Ohio on top of Virginia and there's going be quite a lot of workload.","So we have spent the last five years both getting our facilities in place. Our design tools are mature. the design to build tools are also very mature, and we need to get our work force because we're going to have this increase in volume. We're going to be bringing in a fair number of green labor. We have a robust education program in the trades with Rhode Island and Connecticut and that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full rate production on schedule on the Ohio Replacement and continue on Virginia class.","Shipbuilding, one of the competitive advantages in shipbuilding is that detailed planning is critical, and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for decades and has demonstrated yet again in their preparation for the Ohio. So we have detailed hiring plans, training plans, CapEx plans with the Navy, and of course our design work that we also have in lock step with the Navy on. So, this is all about preparing for success and so far, so good.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","First one is a clarification. Phebe. I think you said that you were going to do repurchase and dividends slightly ahead of your free cash flow. I just wanted to clarify, and maybe I misunderstood. I thought previously it was the 100% of the net income and you kind of make up the difference for repurchase in cash flow.","Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","So Myles, I think we've used a couple different terms in the past. We've talked about normalizing versus the lower free cash flow in these couple of years. But I think the key point is we had had a tremendous amount of cash on the balance sheet coming into the past couple years. A lot of that was timing for a number of the things that we've talked about over the past several quarters. And at this point, the key is we are committed to using that balance sheet to again sort of normalizing that free cash flow at a lower level to return that capital.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","And look, think about it this way, we've long been talking about these two years of fairly low cash flow. We need to normalize that cash flow and augment it by our balance sheet and we've done that. I think about it more like, where are we in cash flow, where are we on the balance sheet, and what resources do we have to continue to go buy shares and other investments as needed. And I think we've managed that pretty prudently. So I think about it as where our cash flow is and where are our cash deployment, where our cash flow is and what our balance sheet looks like and we've been pretty consistent.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the conversion for 2016 you think can still get close to the 2015 conversion level at 65%.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","We'll have to see on that. But we've got plenty of powder on our balance sheet. So, there's been no material change from the guidance that we gave you back in January about our cash flow.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Think about it that way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.

Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.","Hi.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. On the cash flow, you've had this drawdown on the advances in Combat Systems on the large contracts you talked about before. The Middle East lab and the AJACs and you've got the growth in Q4, but does that trend continue next year? Is there any concern that the Middle East customer might slow the intake of deliveries especially as those cash advances get exhausted and just given lower \u2013 the potentially scarcer resources over there?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, let's talk about the Middle East for a moment in general. And this particular customer, we have had a 50-year productive relationship with the Kingdom. And the vast preponderance of all of our combat programs are government-to-government and the contracts have been \u2013 products have been fully vetted and supported and these all happen to be products that the customer wants and needs. So, we have seen no indication from the end-user customer that there is concern on their part or an intent on their part to change the profile of these \u2013 of our deliveries. And look, we will \u2013 we got these large advances and we've been working those down and then we'll continue to refresh cash flow as we \u2013 from these customers as we increase deliveries. And so far, we're in pretty good shape.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And if I could just ask one more, Phebe, maybe for Jason, but a follow-up to Doug's question. On this design release, on Columbia, Ohio Replacement that's upcoming, could \u2013 if the timing is there and the CR doesn't get in the way, could that be an inflow about $700-million-plus of design money to you by the end \u2013 before the end of the year or maybe early next year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Look, we will work with the Navy. I haven't planned on and haven't looked at the specific timing of the cash flow with respect to that order \u2013 of that contract, because we don't have the contract signed yet. So, as soon as we get that contract, we'll have real clarity about the timing quarter-by-quarter of when we can expect the cash associated with that. But there's no way to estimate at the moment until that contract is signed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. The reason I ask is because it sounds like DoD could be making some kind of decision in early November.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Well, they are. They're making their Milestone B decision, which is predicated on that submission that we just made on the components \u2013 detail design and component design. So, that is a trigger. But once that decision is made, then you got a good contract, right?","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Fair enough. Fair enough. Thank you.","Phebe N.

Your line is now open.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. Phebe, just a quick clarification. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said you have got 50 orders on the G500?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","No. What I said was that it has been my experience that you \u2013 to have a successful launch of a new airplane, you need to have 50 orders before entry into service and we on our way to exceed that amount.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful.","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","That helps?","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, it does. Thank you very much. And then, looking out to 2018, you suggested that the G500 will contribute in that year and then meaningfully \u2013 excuse me, in 2017 and meaningfully in 2018. You've also suggested in the past that you've got some delivery slots that are available on the G650 out there in the second quarter of 2018. Just wondering if you could update us on that.","And what I'm trying to figure out here is whether you're going have enough in the orders on the G650 to hold production flat out there in 2018? Or if the plan here is to begin taking production rates down on that and having any hole from an EBIT perspective that gets created by the G650 decline and then filled in by the G500 and that's kind of the key to the recipe of holding EBIT flat through these transitions?","Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.","Yeah. So look, what we said all along is that \u2013 we use that wonderful word feather \u2013 we'll feather in additional G650s. But that production rate during the transition is not sustainable nor healthy and that we would never intend to keep that production rate up. What we aim for is to keep our backlog on G650s on any of our programs, particularly that one, between 18 months and two years and we're now at two years again.","So, as we think about that, I mean, that order book is there for the two \u2013 we've got now two years next available, so that ought to give you a little bit of color on how we intend to think through as we set our deliveries and our delivery schedule. But I have not set, and we haven't set until later \u2013 late November or mid-November our production schedule for next year. So, on the fourth quarter call, I'll give you copious detail what we plan on","doing. Okay?","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great.

My name is [Whitley] (ph), and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Miss Erin Linnihan. Please proceed, ma'am.","Erin Linnihan","Thank you, [Whitley] (ph), and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Thank you, Erin. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.76 per fully diluted share on a revenue of $8.1 billion and earnings of $624 million. It was a good quarter, consistent with our previous guidance and analyst expectation. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.03 on revenue of $31.2 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.5 billion, a return on sales of 8%. It was a very solid year from an operating perspective.","EPS, after charge in discontinued operations related exclusively to the settlement of the A-12 litigation, is $1.40 for the quarter and $6.67 for the year. The settlement represents significant risk mitigation for the Company and ends more than two decades of litigation with the government on favorable terms.","We had a tremendous quarter from a cash generation perspective. Free cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion or 222% of earnings from continuing operations. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion or 107% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2012 by $429 million and demonstrated our commitment to the efficient conversion of earnings into cash.","Let me give you some details on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Sales are up over Q4 2012 by $274 million, 14.7%, and essentially flat sequentially. Earnings significantly outpaced year ago quarter due to the write-off at Jet Aviation in that quarter. Without regard to the write-off, on a non-GAAP basis, earnings still outpaced the year ago by $88 million or 34%. By the way, the basis for all non-GAAP comparisons could be found on Exhibits K, L and M in the press release.","Compared to Q3, operating earnings are down as anticipated by $21 million, principally due to mix shift. For example, lower margin mid-size green aircraft revenue essentially doubled in the quarter while G550 and G450 green revenue declined. As a result, margins decreased by about 80 basis points as we had predicted on last quarter's call.","G&A expenses were also somewhat higher at Gulfstream as a result of commissions on strong sales activity. Net R&D was similar to the prior quarter. There was also a modest loss on pre-owned sales as well in the quarter.","Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter, but the contribution was not as good as it was in Q3. Nevertheless, margin at 16.3% was slightly ahead of our guidance and analyst expectations.","I was particularly pleased with the order book in the quarter. Orders at a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, as occurs here, not only increased backlog but add backlog where it was needed in the 550 and 450 programs. To help you understand this, let me say that while we continue to sign up G650 buyers, it is nowhere near the rate of deliveries given the duration of this backlog.","For the last year, book-to-bill on this product has averaged 0.4 to 1. Given this fact and aggregate book-to-bill of 0.7 or 0.8 to 1 in a quarter, it is very strong for us. This will of course change as the rate between order and entry into service for the G650 moves closer to 24 months, when the standard should once again return to 1 to 1.","On occasion, it is useful to reflect on the guidance given last year at this time and compare it with the actual outcome. In the Aerospace group, we guided to revenue growth of 16% and operating margins in the mid-15% range. Our actual performance reflects a revenue increase of 17.4% and operating margin of 17.4%, almost 200 basis points better than guidance.","This very good result was attributable to a better than expected recovery of Jet Aviation, a very successful execution of 650 deliveries, and better than expected performance in Gulfstream's large service business. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace.","At Combat Systems, it is a story of disappointing revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. In the quarter, sales were down $325 million or 16.4% but earnings were materially better because of the large write-off at ELS in Q4 of last year. Even if we disregard those write-offs, earnings are only down 8.2% on the strength of improved margins across the board.","The story is much the same for the full year. Sales are down $1.9 billion or 23.4% but earnings are up $241 million or 36.3%. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings are down $164 million or 15.4%, once again demonstrating positive operating leverage with improved margins year-over-year in each business.","As you all know, we had extreme difficulty predicting revenue in this group throughout the year. Our initial guidance was to expect revenue to be down 6% for the year. We retreated from that initial forecast quarter-over-quarter but never did catch up with reality, which was a revenue decline of 23.4%. What made us so wrong?","The difference between the initial guidance and the final revenue result is $1.4 billion. Of that, about $500 million is attributable to the impact of sequestration and the shutdown. This was the only group to be affected materially, in no small measure because of the Army's response to both the shutdown and sequestration. Army spending slowed during the year which hit us hard in the fourth quarter as they worried about the potential shortage of funds and its impact on their ability to take care of the war effort. Our service set moreover reacted very cautiously to disruptions in their funding stream.","Another roughly $500 million was attributed to a large international order expected early in the year that kept slipping to the right in very protected negotiation. The balance was from various programs where funds were appropriated but not obligated by the customer or obligated in smaller amounts as well at several additional international orders. Fortunately, this revenue shortfall was offset in part by dramatically improved operating performance resulting in higher than anticipated margin rate.","Marine Systems, revenue was off 2%, $34 million, compared to the year ago quarter and down $67 million to 3.9% sequentially. However, revenue was up almost 2% for the year, about $120 million. Operating earnings were down $37 million, 18.9%, against the year ago quarter, and down $11 million, 6.5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were down $84 million or 11.2%.","The earnings decline against last year and last year's fourth quarter is due entirely to the end of the profitable T-AKE program. This group was highly consistent in both revenue and earnings throughout the year with a 9.9% margin rate for the year. All of the shipyards performed well in the quarter and for the year.","In the Marine group, we guided you to a revenue increase of 2%. We were very close with an actual increase of 1.8%. We forecasted margins in the low to mid 9% range and wound up at 9.9% on the strength of very good operating performance in each of our shipyards. All in all, a very good year for the Marine group.","IS&T is the business group that held up well in a difficult environment. Revenue in the quarter was up $114 million or 4.4% against the year ago quarter. It was up a similar amount, 4.3%, sequentially, and up $251 million or 2.5% for the year, really quite good for a short cycle business in last year's turbulence.","Operating earnings of $196 million in the quarter were materially better than the fourth quarter a year ago, because if you will recall, significant charges were incurred in that quarter. However, even on a non-GAAP basis, in other words without regard to the write-offs, operating earnings improved quarter-over-quarter by $68 million or 53.1%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were off by $20 million. For the year on a non-GAAP basis, earnings were within [$3 million] (ph), so essentially flat.","On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance for this group that forecasted a decline in revenue of 5% and operating margins in the low 8% range. It turned out that revenue was up 2.5% and margins were 7.7%. Margins were pressured in two of the businesses units by severance and other restructuring costs as well as the failure of the business in the U.K. to meet its plan. All in all, the end result was consistent with guidance but achieved in a different way.","On a Company-wide basis, we provided EPS guidance of $6.60 to $6.70. We wound up at $7.03. About $0.09 of that improvement came from share repurchase, another $0.09 from a slight rate lower than planned tax rate, and the balance from operating performance.","So let me give you a few thoughts about 2014 initially by business group. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $9 billion, up around 11%. Margin rate should be around 17%, somewhat down from 2013 on continuing mix shift. However, operating earnings will be up 7.3% to 7.5%. I should add that margin rates will be lower in the first three quarters with a dramatic increase in the fourth.","In Combat Systems, we expect a more modest revenue decline of about 4% to 4.5%. Embedded in this plan is about $1.2 billion of revenue for the same international program that slipped to the right last year. We anticipate a first quarter order. If not received on that schedule, we will have further erosion of revenue from this guidance and we will address its impact directly with you in the second quarter.","The majority of next year's domestic revenue is in our backlog and has been de-rated. So, absent more delays on the international front, we should be pretty close to our estimate of revenue. Margins are expected to be around 14%, still very respectable.","The Marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very modest slip in operating earnings, entirely the result of mix shift.","Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of almost 20%, but an improved margin rate of 8.2%, 50 basis points better than last year. Almost all of the anticipated revenue is in backlog and our plan shows this year is the low watermark for revenue.","All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $30 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12%, and a return on sales of roughly 8%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 31% tax rate and assumes we buy enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercises.","This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 per fully diluted share, that compares with last year's guidance of $6.60 to $6.70, at the same time on the same basis. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the plan and the use of capital to repurchase shares.","With respect to share repurchase, as is obvious, we did not return all of our free cash flow in 2013 to our shareholders despite our intention to do so. This was because we were constrained by a pension funding rule that our CFO, Jason Aiken, will explain to you shortly. It is our intention to make up for last year in the first quarter.","With that in mind, we are establishing imminently an accelerated share repurchase plan for the repurchase of 11.4 million shares, the remainder of our current authorization. We will seek additional share authority at our February Board of Directors meeting for a share repurchase plan throughout the year.","I would now like to turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.","Jason W. Aiken","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to review a few financial items with you before the question-and-answer period, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","The full year's interest expense in 2013 was $86 million, which was in line with our guidance. This was down $70 million from 2012, reflecting the impact of our $2.4 billion debt refinancing completed in December 2012 that lowered the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 2.2%. For 2014, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $90 million.","At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, and by that I mean cash in excess of debt, of approximately $1.4 billion, an improvement of more than $2 billion over our net debt position last year.","Moving on to taxes, our effective tax rate was 30.7% for the quarter and 31.1% for the full year. The fourth quarter and full-year rates were slightly lower than anticipated due to a tax benefit associated with the shutdown of a product line in one of our IS&T businesses. That said, we expect an effective tax rate in 2014 and for the foreseeable future in the range of 30.5% to 31%. So you can consider a rate in this range to be the new normal. This is driven by a variety of puts and takes, but primarily by higher expected foreign earnings.","In the quarter, as Phebe noted, we recorded a charge in discontinued operations for the settlement of the long-standing dispute with the U.S. Navy regarding the termination of the A-12 program. This charge reflects our agreement with the Navy to provide $198 million credit toward the design and construction activities on the DDG-1000 program. We expect that this amount will be expended through 2017 as the program progresses.","This agreement puts behind us litigation that's been outstanding for over 20 years, and recall that following the Supreme Court's ruling a few years ago, we faced the prospective years of more costly litigation without the possibility of any upside beyond a walkway. The charge is shown net of the related tax benefit of $69 million for a net loss in discontinued operations of $129 million.","A quick point on pensions. During 2013, we contributed approximately $600 million in cash to our pension plan. And for 2014, our funding expectation is about the same, just slightly lower, with most of that funding expected to occur during the third quarter.","And finally, as Phebe alluded to, I'd like to address capital deployment in the fourth quarter. As you'll recall, our intent in 2013 was to deploy essentially all of our free cash flow in a shareholder friendly manner while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through the first three quarters of the year, we were headed down that path and up to that point we had refunded 87% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","As we entered the fourth quarter, we got tripped up by a pension funding rule that constrained our ability to deploy any more capital through the end of the year. Under the funding rules of the Pension Protection Act, the substantial charges we took in the fourth quarter of 2012 placed limits on the amount of capital that we could deploy to shareholders. Once we hit the cap, any additional share repurchases or dividend payments would have to have been matched dollar for dollar with over and above contributions to our pension plan. This would have made any additional share repurchases highly inefficient given our planned pension funding profile and the timing of our recovery of pension contributions under our contracts.","As a result, we refrained from executing any additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter after we hit the cap. At the end of the year, we sit with $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and anticipate another year of strong cash generation in 2014. That leaves us well-positioned to embark on the capital deployment strategy for 2014 that Phebe outlined for you just a few minutes ago.","Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan","","Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. [Whitley] (ph), could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Phebe, I had a question about the capital deployment that you just outlined, and I know it's a little bit more than one question because it's a little bit multipart, but if you're going to have an accelerated share repurchase program of 11.4 million shares in the first quarter, won't that reduce the number of shares for the full year right away, and so why would you guide to a flat with the fourth quarter number? And then just in general, can you talk about your thoughts about $5 billion on the balance sheet and what the right number for you to carry in terms of cash is?","Phebe N. Novakovic","So, we have built our plan like we did initially last year, and that is, assuming we cover dilution. We don't know the full effect of the cost or the timing of that, once we put in place the accelerated share repurchase. So, as we go forward, we will clearly adjust the guidance to reflect the impact of that plus additional share repurchases.","So with respect to the balance sheet, we have accumulated a fair amount of cash, a lot of cash on that balance sheet, and we are very comfortable with seeking additional authority from our Board, both with respect to dividends and share repurchases. So we are mindful of that cash on the balance sheet, we fully recognize that that is not the best use of cash, and you will see us very actively this year returning a lot of that cash to our shareholders, keeping in mind that we cover and protect our debt rating. So, I hope that gives you some color.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan","Could you give a little more color on demand at Gulfstream? It sounds like you're pleased with the order intake in the 450 and 550 in the quarter, but maybe just give us a sense as to how far your backlog extends and how many deliveries you're planning on this year?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Okay. We are expecting 118 large-cabin deliveries and 40 mid-cabin. So, that's up from next year. Our fourth quarter, as you noted, Gulfstream was our strongest quarter in the past two years across all of our product lines and was particularly strong on the 450, 550 and 280. Going forward, our pipeline is robust which harbours well I think for our performance going forward.","I think you can also \u2013 to think a little bit about where we are in our backlog, I think it helps to understand that the next available slot for the 280 is in the 9 to 12 month range, for the 450 and 550 in the 12 to 15 month range, and 650 in the 45 month range. So I think that gives you a little additional calibration.","And you may have also noticed that we had a significant number of options in the quarter across all of our portfolio products. Consistent with our past accounting treatment, we did not treat those as orders. Let me tell you how it works. Where you exercise \u2013 when you exercise the option, then you get a slot and then we book the order with sufficient down payment. So we are confident in the reliability of these options but we are booking them according to our previous practices.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","With the latest budget deal, Phebe, I think we have a little better visibility at least into the total DoD authority on the top line, which seems to be flattish I guess through fiscal 2015. So based on your comments or in concert with your comments on Combat and on IS&T, should we look at calendar 2014 as the bottom for those businesses, and if you don't get the international order, then how do we look at Combat?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, okay, let me take that in two parts. It's really quite a blessing and a definite upside, both for our customer and for us to have some stability in program funding, reducing the uncertainty which is very, very difficult to manage to. So that is, the Congress are very grateful for their attempt to get back to regular order.","Our programs, the Marine group, we're fully funded in anticipation of what we anticipated. Combat Systems, we received funding again in line with our expectations. And the same is true in IS&T. So all in all, I think we've got a pretty solid funding base.","Now let's talk a little bit about the bottom, okay, because this is kind of where your \u2013 and I'll take that also in two parts. Let's talk about Combat. We believe we're almost there and that the major slide is behind us. Let me give you a sense of the internal dynamics of that group.","Two of our three businesses have Army exposure, OTS and Land Systems. OTS has maintained very stable and consistent revenues. Land Systems, with its exposure to Army demand and combat vehicles, have seen their revenue decline substantially. On the other hand, we see increasing orders in Canada and the U.K. on the SV program. So, the Army is becoming a smaller source of revenue for us, and as I noted, we have significantly derisked our Army revenue for this year based on the experience we had with the Army last year and how they responded to the needs of the war and the available funding.","So, one of the things I think that's important to understand is, these businesses are earnings and cash powerhouses. So, that gives me a lot of confidence that we'll continue to manage through whatever changes we have in revenue. But I think we're getting close to the bottom. Now, let me give you a little bit of context.","I gave you the estimate for our international order of about $1.2 billion and I'll address that with you if that doesn't come-in in force during the second quarter, but let me tell you, I wouldn't have \u2013 based on last year's experience, I wouldn't have put it in this year if I weren't very confident that that is imminent on the horizon.","And I think finally, just to add a little bit of textural context for you, if you think about GD at large, our Army exposure declined significantly during the course of 2013, which shouldn't surprise you given what happened on the Combat Systems side in revenue, from about 16%, and going forward for this year, across all of GD, the Army is now down to 10% which I see as another risk mitigation factor in thinking through our revenue.","So IS&T, C4 is the primary business in IS&T that is affected by the exposure to the Army and we have again derisked that plan, and that's in part what's driving some of the revenue decline. So I think I've given you sort of a multifaceted answer.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So, it sounds like it's this year, the timing could vary between the segments but\u2026?","Phebe N. Novakovic","That's my view, and look, we learned \u2013 and this is new territory for both our customers and us in understanding how they were going to react to their funding pressure. So we have taken that learning and incorporated it into our thinking about sales going forward, and that's why we have derisked those plans.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","And you feel pretty good about tactical comms and the IT services area as compared to the ISR?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, so let me give you a little bit of color because implied in your question drives us to a related issue of the decline in revenue at IS&T.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Right.","Phebe N. Novakovic","So, first, let me say that last year was better than expected revenue year, right. We had predicted we'd be down about 5% and instead we're up 2.5%. So some of the decline we anticipated last year is showing up this year. Second, as I noted, we built an IS&T plan in which the majority of our revenues in the backlog have been derisked. So there's very little additional risk on the downside. Let me give you, to your question, a little bit of color by business unit so you can understand some of the changes.","GD IT last year had a particularly great year in revenue as a result of their increases in the commercial wireless demand business and their call center operations in healthcare. So in 2014, we're seeing their revenue decline of about 10% come from the slowing in the call center revenue but a considerable slowing in commercial wireless, and I would remind you that our wireless business tends to be pretty lumpy. On intel, for our intel business, they're looking about at 10% revenue decline, which is largely driven by a mix across their lines of business that have more to do with the anticipated start times of new contracts. So where does that leave us?","The real story here is in C4 where our revenues are declining by about a third. So let me help you think about this business to put this in some context. Think about it in four buckets, U.S. Army, Canada, U.K., and U.K.-based international. We held out pretty well in 2013 in C4 Systems because a majority of our sales were in our backlog, but the challenge is that the U.S. Army sales last year showed up in considerably lower volume in 2014 across our product lines, networking, communication and encryption. And it is in those lines of business that we have significantly derisked our plan going forward. Hence, part of the drive of the primary determinant of the third, 33%, reduction in sales. So, all right, that's that one bucket.","As for Canada, our business is strong and I'm very optimistic about the future of the MHP program. We're very pleased that Crown has agreed to go forward with that program and we have a very strong and cooperative working relationship with our customer, Sikorsky. I also like how our Canadian commercial business looks.","Finally, U.K. and international, you'll recall last year that we were pretty disappointed with the poor performance of GD U.K., and as a result we moved all the non-vehicle business under C4. Remember that Combat Systems, Land Systems in particular, picked up the SV program, which is where it belonged. And C4 has done a great job. It's taken cost out in stabilizing that business. So I think, to be just real clear here, there is considerably more upside here than downside on the revenues, but I would ask you not to get too far ahead of me.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Right. Well, that was tremendous color. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","Phebe, I wanted to go back to capital deployment for just a second. In particular, the 2014 cash flow that you'll generate, if you can give us some color on net income to free cash flow conversion? I know you tampered that expectation a bit for 2013, you overachieved it to the sort of 400% plus, just curious your outlook for 2014. And then, to 2013 you had committed to returning it to shareholders a vast majority and you're fulfilling that here in the first quarter. Is it the same commitment for the cash generated in 2014?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes. So look, I don't want to give you an exact cash number but I can tell you this. We anticipate cash for 2014 in line with our previous history. We may see some puts and takes on timing with respect to payments but we are \u2013 you'll see cash conversion that's very similar to our prior experience and our full intention to deploy almost all of that, not all, of that free cash flow to our shareholders. Okay?","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Yes, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.","David Strauss - UBS","Following up on Myles' question, Phebe, could you maybe just address working capital and how you view that? I mean over the past couple of years, inventory has been a significant drag, I think receivables have been a drag as well. Just how you see the opportunity there to generate some cash out of working capital? And then on M&A, I know you took a break here in 2013 on the M&A side, but just how you're thinking about that relative to what you're committing to in terms of cash return to shareholders?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Sure. So, you may recall at the beginning of last year, I told you we were returning back to basics, focusing on operations. A key part of that focus on operations is a wholesome cash generation capability, and I think we've demonstrated that, and we do that by working our working capital hard and we've done that. We also had a great collection year. So, you'll continue to see us work our working capital. Each one of our business units is focused on that like a laser. So I'm confident that we'll do well on that regard.","So M&A, look, I'm going to tell you exactly what I told you last year. I don't have anything on my horizon at present, and so I don't anticipate our behaviour with respect to M&A to be any different this year than it was last year. Okay?","Erin Linnihan","","Let's take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","Phebe, I wondered if you might address, in just sort of a general commentary, I mean a year ago at this time you said you were very internally focused on the business, you did a good bit of restructuring, you moved some town around, you made some organizational changes. I guess from a high-level, how did things play out in 2013 relative to your plan and how are you thinking about 2014 and how might that be different? I mean I can appreciate you never really finish driving improvements in the business, but what sort of opportunities do you think will be created this year from the improvement you tried to undertake last year?","Phebe N. Novakovic","So let me take that in a couple of parts. Referring back to my answer in the last question, we had our back to basics which focused on margin expansion, ROIC, and good cash conversion, and I think with respect to each one of those metrics, we performed very, very well. We had 11.8% operating margins, 107% free cash flow, return on sales of 8% and an ROIC of 16.6%.","So, wholesome directionally correct, and that doesn't happen without the blocking and tackling on operations every single day. So the team did a fantastic job living up to their opportunities and we're going to do the exact same thing again this year. We have talked to the management team about the need to continue to focus on doing well by our shareholders and creating value. So I'm very comfortable that you're going to see more of the same.","To give you kind of a sense of where we are, and I think embedded in your question is, so kind of how do we see GD, right. So, let me give you what I think about the value proposition for us and let me explain it to you in this way. For me in my mind, Gulfstream is the primary growth engine for both earnings and revenue. Marine is the steady producer of earnings and cash with growing revenue at about 5% over the next few years. So, pretty good and pretty solid. Combat is a strong operating business, as is C4, but in both instances they are exposed to the U.S. Army. The rest of IS&T remains stable.","So, think about this, let me give you a little bit of granularity on this one aspect. Only two of our 11 businesses are in a significant down cycle, Land Systems and C4, from Army exposure. So our imperative there as well as in the rest of our business is to extend our margins, we're going to reduce our PP&E and working capital to the minimum required to support our revenue and manage for cash. So that is \u2013 and I think when you think about the composition of the businesses within GD, I think that gives you sort of an overview of how I'm looking at it and how I bound the risk.","Finally, I would add that international revenues are increasing from 25% in 2013 if you include, which I do, three FMS to 30% in 2014. So that again is another driver of the value proposition in GD. We don't make a lot of noise about our international sales but we have year-over-year improved that percentage. So I think \u2013 I hope that gives you a little bit of the color at 50,000 feet.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","No, it does. I just wondered if there was anything sort of lesson learned as you sit down and craft a set of plans again a year on in this year's plan and say, what do I wish I would have known or implemented last year that I didn't?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Well, so I think one is obvious, we were wrong about when our fairly large international order was going to happen. So, as I said, I wouldn't be forecasting that for this year if I weren't particularly certain that it was coming [indiscernible] I got in some places on this subject. But I think the most profound lesson learned here is that we had unprecedented and unforeseen behavior by our Army customer, all for good and valid reasons, but their reaction to the changes in their funding stream were not anticipated by us. So we've got a year of learning of that under our belt and that is why we have derisked our U.S. domestic Army exposure in all of our businesses that have that exposure. Does that help?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed, sir.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","I wanted to ask a question about the G650 because I assume you just had a great year of margins at Gulfstream and when you go forward here, I'm assuming you still expect the G650 to be a strong contributor to margin improvement over time. But I'm interested in the timing, when you expect that to be additive to margins, can that happen in 2014, and how should we think about the margin trajectory for that program?","Phebe N. Novakovic","It's additive now. So in terms of clearly earnings, it's slightly dilutive to overall margins simply because we continue down our learning curve. And remember, last year we had a fairly lumpy learning curve on green deliveries because of the disequilibrium that I explained to you last year at this time on the 650 retrofit. But we're through that and we're continuing to see learning improvements on 650 green and on completions. So the margins are going to get better on 650 and I expect throughout this year and into next. I'm not going to give you a real good sense of what the terminal value may be of our margins on that. We don't know yet. So what we led you \u2013 what we've guided you to is what we see, what we anticipate in our 650 margin performance, and it's wholesome and it's improving as we would hope and expect.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","And as you move down that learning curve, you said earlier that the first slots are available about 45 months from now, presumably if you took rate up, you would move down even faster and you would have more operating leverage. I mean how are you thinking about that? 45 months is a long time to not add to a production rate.","Phebe N. Novakovic","So, as you well know on us, we set our production rates at the beginning of every year based on what we believe the supply chain can handle, what our manufacturing, the optimization of our manufacturing efficiency. So as we have factored all of that into setting the 650 production rate, and to the extent that we have any \u2013 if that time compresses between order and delivery, we'll notify our customers first of earlier opportunities, but I don't anticipate any significant time compression, at least in the near-term.","And look, what we want to be able to do is plan our manufacturing green and delivery that are consistent and improvable and repeatable every single year. So we could pull through, assuming that supply chain could handle it, make that assumption, we could pull forward additional slots and production slots but that is not necessarily good for the long-term. I think it gives us a pop and a pop that's not necessarily repeated in the next year.","So, when you're manufacturing complex platforms with a robust and diversified supply-chain, you want to be very mindful of what your supply chain can handle without driving up their cost, which then are reflected in your price. So look, this is a \u2013 there's not a year that goes by or even on a quarterly basis that we don't look at, have we set the right production rate, and we're very comfortable where we are now.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Is limiting factor here confidence in the longer term demand trajectory or is it getting part of your supply chain fully up to speed, and so you're comfortable with then being able to go to a higher rate?","Phebe N. Novakovic","We are very confident in the long-term prospects for this product. I think it's proven itself and we've seen increasing demand over time, because of all the niches that that product serves. You know, you've got to be careful when you start up a new line, both of which is tough [indiscernible] and this is a primary consideration that you structure your supply-chain. And you can't \u2013 the perturbation from a break in your supply chain is very, very difficult to recover from. So that's why we have thoughtful, predictable, managed production rate on the 650, but we are very confident in the demand profile for that airplane.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please proceed.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Phebe, I guess I just want to follow up on kind of Doug's question a little bit. First I guess maybe a clarification. I thought you mentioned that G650 green deliveries potentially doubled year-over-year. Was that for the full year or for the fourth quarter?","Phebe N. Novakovic","I think what I said was that we had a mix shift from \u2013 at least what I said in my remarks \u2013 was a mix shift from the mid-size deliveries. That was really one of the key factors. And then we had some increase in our \u2013 considerable increase in our 650 green deliveries but it was a little slower, you might recall that we had anticipated, because of that retrofit issue we have. So next year going forward, we see 650 production ramping up slightly, and that's one of the reasons for the margin performance in the fourth quarter, as we've got a whole \u2013 we have a number of deliveries across the board, across our portfolio in the fourth quarter really driven by, by the way, customer demands and preferences and then additional 650 green deliveries.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay, and if I could just squeeze in related to that, just the question that I was trying to get at was, it sounds like the disconnect has been eliminated, especially between green completions that you talked about are essentially worked down quite a bit\u2026","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","And then going forward, the 650 sounds like it's back on what was its original plan, where we stop green deliveries would be modestly increasing [indiscernible] I think back in 2011, it was talked about at every 10 to 15 aircraft a year. Is it fair to assume that kind of we're back on that case?","Phebe N. Novakovic","We are but we're going to set our expectations based less on the past and more of our assessment of the future.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Hello there, Jason, welcome to the earnings call. Just one quick clarification question and then one on Combat Systems. Phebe, you mentioned that the 450, 550 deliveries were down in the fourth quarter. Does that mean you were carrying some inventory into the new year that's going to get worked down, so that's the clarification question? And then I would love to, if you would, just a couple of extra minutes on the outlook for Combat Systems. First, what's changed, what gives you more comfort now on this international deal, so if you can just kind of qualitatively speak about why we're so close now? And then maybe a little bit of commentary about the opportunities and risks in other areas of Combat Systems that you see over the next couple of years. We've got some debate going on about the ground combat vehicle, this chatter about the potential cancellation of program up in Canada, so those will be risks, and I was curious if there are any other opportunities out there?","Phebe N. Novakovic","All right, let me try to get them in order and if I forget one of your sub-questions, you can remind me. Inventory, we don't have any on the 450, 550, we don't have buildup that we're carrying into next year. So let me give you a little bit of color on this international order. We are essentially done with the negotiations and we believe that we're going to move forward pretty quickly, but I am not about to get ahead of our customers here. But I can again reassure you that there is no way I would have put this into the plan had I not been confident that we wouldn't be repeating last year.","So look, with respect to opportunities and risks, let's think about that. Land Systems, and again this is largely we're talking about Land Systems, Land Systems have opportunities both in Canada across the whole variety of programs that we were not even materially affected by Canada or affected at all by Canada's cancellation of that program. They also have increased revenue opportunities and earnings opportunities on the SV program in the U.K. Both are very comfortable with our performance on that program.","GCV, we factored hardly at all into our plan. We've got Strykers factored into our plan at a derisked basis, reflecting how the Army executed the funding. Take for example what we used as our predicate is the funding profile for the third Stryker brigade. It kind of came in lumps, little lumps, as funding became available. The Army is dedicated to modernizing its Stryker fleet with these double-V-hulled that have enormous advantage in survivability of our troops in the event of attack. So it's a life saver for them literally and they are committed to making that happen. They're just going to have to execute funds as they become available. So we have assumed going forward that we're going to get lumpy orders and I think that's appropriate.","Tanks, for our Abrams tank program, we got about 100 million in this last build that we're going to continue to work in U.S. and international orders to bridge Lima until \u2013 which is where, as you well know, we do the tank manufacturing \u2013 until the 2018 timeframe when the Army begins to or expects to begin their modernization effort. And by the way, with respect to that, I think that the loss of critical skills and the very high cost associated with the production break at Lima are very well understood, and I personally am very appreciative for the leadership and support that we've received this last year from the Congress.","So I think that we have taken a very, very candid, realistic look at each one of our programs, and the ones that we think are vulnerable, we have had very, very, very small portion in our \u2013 our sales estimate represent a small portion, and we have adjusted our expectations on our more mature programs in line with our experience over how Army is executing its funds. Okay?","Jason Gursky - Citi","Okay, great. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","Looks like I can get two like everyone else, so I'll see what I can [ask] (ph). You have down revenues but you have up headcount. How do we square that?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, so here's the thing. Our headcount went up \u2013 and let me parse that for you \u2013 our headcount went up primarily because in the last few months, GD IT hired about 8,000 new employees to cover the ramp-up of the demand in the call center in their healthcare portfolio. And by the way, those are cost-plus contracts, so people equals revenue, right. So offset by that \u2013 and what that does is sort of camouflage the fact that we've had a 30% decline in our employment at those two businesses where we crossed actually, across Combat and within C4, of their employment. So, part of it is that we've got that smaller businesses but one of our business is adding a lot of employees to it. Okay, does that make sense to you?","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","Yes, totally. And the other thing is, when you sort of gave us this outlook for the world for your business, you didn't include the benefit from either the ISR, if I'm correct, and also whatever else you might do. So how do you put sort of your EPS growth as part of the overall operating metric that you'd like either your business units or in fact the Board sort of ask of the officers of the Company? And then just balance that against ROIC, both of which are very important.","Phebe N. Novakovic","Yes, so we are \u2013 we built our plan and I gave you the original initial guidance on where our EPS is based on, what we almost always do, and that is anticipate a share repurchase sufficient to cover the dilution, we didn't anticipate or we didn't put into our EPS estimate at this juncture what the results of the share repurchase are going to be, in part because we have to work out some of the cost structure and timing around that. So I think you can rest assure that going forward, probably even in second quarter, we'll give you an update of what was that looking like to us.","So with respect to ROIC, as you know, we drive that, there are two components, the numerator and the denominator. Our business units are responsible for the numerator and in no small measure. Our corporate headquarters is responsible for the denominator. So we anticipate an ROIC improvement against our plan for the remainder of the year but there are an awful lot of moving parts here. I would tell you that we significantly outperformed our ROIC against our internal targets for last year. So I anticipate that the guys will get at it working hard, bring down working capital and increase [indiscernible], okay.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company","Thank you very much.","Erin Linnihan","","[Whitley] (ph), I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Please proceed, sir.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.","A quick one on Gulfstream. You're going to be up eight large aircraft, I assume that's got to be 650s, and that looks like it's at least 60% of the revenue growth and it has above average margins today and the margins are improving, and I assume the mid-size aircraft, the margins also are improving. How come the overall margins are down?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Largely, a question of the mix shift between the 450, 550 and new 650 and 280, and we're making a calculation about what we see in learning in margin expansion in those two new lines. Also offset in part by, as we talked about before, the significant increases in 450 cost as a result of some of our supplier \u2013 renegotiation of supplier contracts for major parts of that airplane. So, I think that Gulfstream has the opportunity to outperform but we're going to take that one step at a time.","I would also note that while Jet continues to be profitable in 2014, the contribution is likely to be less as they ramp-up on some of their new revenues that they have in-house. So all up, I think we're looking at some margin compression but we'll work hard to outperform that.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.","Thank you. And a quick one on pension. How did you do last year in terms of investment performance and the discount rate because I would assume, given your heavy asset focus on equities, you would have had terrific performance, and given all of that, how come you still have to put $600 million into the plan?","Phebe N. Novakovic","Let me ask Jason to address that but we're going to put about $550 million in, but Jason, why don't you give some color on that.","Jason W. Aiken","Sure. Your presumption is correct. We did perform well in our returns last year. It was somewhere in the ballpark I think of 16.9% return. So we are very pleased with that. As you also alluded to, discount rates did edge up, so our funding status saw some significant improvement. The amount of contributions for the coming year are based strictly on the Pension Protection Act minimum funding requirement and that's what we'll stick to, is funding at those minimum levels for the foreseeable future.","Erin Linnihan","","Thank you for joining our call today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff VP for Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Candice, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you Erin, and good morning. As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion, and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the self-side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margins, and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher margins, $10 million less in taxes, resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance.","Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30-basis point improvement in operating margin, and 140-basis point lower effective tax rate. I should note that our earnings in the year-ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our Commercial Cyber business. Excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million, or less than 1%, and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margins, and a lower effective tax rate.","Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 and compare it to the first half of 2015. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million. EPS was $0.36 better. In short, we are off to a good start, ahead of both our internal plan and external expectation. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year, and wrap that into our EPS guidance.","First, Aerospace; Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million were only $5 million less on a 90-basis point improvement in operating margins. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4%, and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the G450 and the G550, offset in part by increased delivery of the G650. However, earnings at $845 million are off only $25 million on a 60-basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, we are well-positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goal for the year.","By the way, recall that last year we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supplier settlement. Absent that contribution, earnings would actually have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter, and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical or unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book-to-bill was not much better. About a third of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin.","Activity and interest level were good throughout the quarter. But at the end of the quarter when many transactions typically closed, activity almost ceased as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away, and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month, slightly improved economics stories in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction, seemed to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective.","You may recall that the G500 made its first flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mach. Flight test is going very well, and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year.","Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 60-basis point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All-in-all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3%, and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million, or 6.6%, against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130-basis point margin expansion. Pretty impressive operating performance.","Work is progressing quite well on our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our AJAX program and our Canadian Mid-East (8:08) contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast ceiling (8:13) of the up-gun Stryker. With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter, and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on submarine material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10-basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million, or 4.4% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us, and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half.","Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year-ago quarter $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20-basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the Commercial Cyber products business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6%, on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is the strongest in nearly five years. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $23 million, 0.5%, and operating earnings were up $38 million, or 8.4%, on a 90-basis point improvement in margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book-to-bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book-to-bill equal to or greater than 1:1. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half.","So turning to guidance. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, and then compare it to what we told you in January, and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year or even slightly better. Despite all the handwringing by some, these two businesses will continue to perform well.","So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion, and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion, and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between $8.1 billion and $8.2 billion, and margins around 9.2%. For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double-digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure, and that operating margins would be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year.","So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion, operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion, and a return on sales of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, but higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate, and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second quarter, but much like the first quarter, followed by a very strong fourth quarter.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year, and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group, and when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million, had the exchange rates that prevailed in the first half of 2015 remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher.","Moving down the income statement, our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million, versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover in just a minute. We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, though more weighted to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion, and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature, and we're in the process of refinancing that debt as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million from general corporate purposes to include share repurchases.","Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock options and restricted stock. In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We're at a rate of 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full-year rate right around 29%. On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first six months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than two times our free cash flow for the first half.","Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Candice, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. And our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, Phebe. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe, thanks for all the color on Gulfstream, but maybe just a little bit more color on the large cabin market, and how you saw it evolve in Q2, both from a used inventory perspective, how you're competing on the G450 and G550 with the used inventory that's out there, and the G650, and then what you saw regionally? Did North America hold in there pretty well? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So I think I gave you a pretty robust response in my remarks, but let me parse this, our market, in a couple of ways. First, let's talk about the G650 pre-owned market. So I've seen some folks saying there are going to be 20, or there are 21 used airplanes in the market. We simply do not see them. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with one pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5% of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a G650 used market, so in my mind, this should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near-term availability rather than wait.","So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So G650, so if you talk about by model, the G650 demand remains quite active. In our subs market, sub-sections of the market, the G450 and G550 are, as we anticipated during this period of transition to the G500 and G600, complicated the touch by competitors' overproduction. By the way, I might tell you that the G500 and G600, a lot of those positions are sold in 2016 and 2017. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America, and I think the rest split between Mid-East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order.","Okay?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. I wanted to switch to Marine for a moment, Phebe. You guided for us earlier, but you have a lot going on there. You've got the Block IV pricing going up, there's growth in ORP (20:33) funding. When would we start to see some real improvement in sales from all of these positives?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've been experiencing that improvement, but when we look at the Navy's plan to continue with the Gulfstream, or the Virginia-class deliveries, as well as other (21:00) replacement, we see that we get some real nice ignition starting in 2019, when we have long-lead delivery \u2013 how we're anticipating, based on the Navy's plan, long-lead delivery in 2019. But let's not forget, this has been a very nice, steady quarter-over-quarter performer.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","True. And how would the TAO(NYSE:X) factor in, and does that impact NASSCO's margins later this year, next year, the win there?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the TAO(X), let's remember that our award was for one ship, and multiple, I think with five options, subject to the request, authorization and appropriation. So those oilers are right in our wheelhouse, and we ought to be able to perform very nicely on those. And it positions us well for the 17 ships in the Navy contract. It was an unusual award, but it has \u2013 there were no surprises, and I think, from (22:06) was an unusual contracting process, but from my point of view, there were no surprises, because sort of lined up with, who does what well.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Phebe, you talked a lot about the earnings and the revenue for the year. In the past, you've talked about free cash flow conversion relative to last year. So now with a higher net income, should we still see a similar conversion? And somewhat related, we knew you were going to be eating into those international combat advances, but really, what should that advances line look like when we get to the end of the year on the balance sheet?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sam, so as I addressed in my remarks, we do continue to see full year free cash flow for this year looking similar to what we had last year, although as I said, a little bit inverted toward the second half of the year, slightly different profile than we had last year from a timing standpoint. As it relates to the advances, we'll continue to draw down on those, so you'll see that balance \u2013 you've seen it come down throughout the first half of the year, and we'll see that continue, as we continue to make progress on the production side of those contracts through the balance of the year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But coming down at the same rate?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't have the exact specifics on that. We can perhaps talk after the call on that. But directionally, yeah, we'll see it continue to come down.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to try and understand a little bit of the margin situation at Gulfstream. I mean, the margins have been great, at around 20% level, even with declining production. So, can you talk a little bit about what's enabled you to achieve that as you're going through a transition to the new programs? You have a lower rate on the G450 and G550. And when you roll that forward, do you expect, if you have to take rate down perhaps even more on the G450 and G550, can you keep that margin level through the product transition?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let's talk about this year, and I don't want to get into too much specificity in 2017 and 2018. But the margins are driven by \u2013 and this is true year in and year out \u2013 they're driven by our managing of costs and our cost reduction, in addition to the G650's nice contribution. So when I think about that, that and our performance on service has been quite nice through the course of the year. So I have a great deal of confidence that we can continue to maintain our profitability as we go through. We'll have to modify it somewhat, but with our profitability, going through this transition period.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And that is \u2013 but even as you take rates down and you, in theory, would lose some operating leverage.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've pretty much planned in the rates on the G450. I don't see any more reductions. In fact, I don't see any more reduction on the G450. And the G550, we see very minimal changes going forward. So looks, our job is to keep earnings up as high as possible during this transition period, and manage our margins. We're going to continue to do that. I think we've demonstrated that track record the last six quarters, and we're going to continue going forward.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. First, Phebe, I have a clarification.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thank you. Sorry. I think you said G500, G600 sold in 2016 and 2017. Did you mean that you're largely sold out in 2017 and 2018?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm sorry, if I wasn't clear on that. The G650 is sold out in its entirety through the first quarter or through 2016, and also in its entirety through 2017. So when we look at the order activity on the G500 and G600, what I'm saying is, is that our expectations for entry into service would remain the same. In that projection, we have sold an awful lot of our both of those G500s and G600s. So that positions us very well, I think.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","So I'm sorry, again, so 2017 and 2018 for the G500 and G600 are largely sold. Is that how I'm hearing this?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We've got a lot of sales","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","And then just to follow this, it sounds like, though, there were some adjustments to the large cabin delivery schedule. Could you articulate where you are for this year? And I guess, you probably won't. And then maybe if you can address some elements of how you're thinking about 2017.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I don't want to get into 2017 at the moment because, as you know, we provide that to you in the fourth quarter of the 2016 call by tradition. So that said, let me give you some color on where we are in the moment. First, production rates this year have not changed. So we've kept them the same as when we set this plan. Revenue is impacted in 2016 by a couple of factors; one, we have one less screen (28:12) airplane, I think it's the G280, and six fewer completions. We're moving these completions from this year into next, largely because of customer preferences on when they want to take the plane. And then we got a mix of other smaller puts and takes.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Phebe. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up on the G500 and the G600 really quickly. I think, at the launch event a few years ago you suggested that the book-to-bill, or the bookings that you take on that aircraft would be kind of barbelled. You take some at the beginning, would have a lull until you got closer to the entry into service of the aircraft. I'm wondering, if that's still the way that you're thinking about that. And at what point historically do you see the second into that barbell begin to pick up? Meaning when (29:16) we see some more orders for the G500 and G600 begin to come in relative to the entry into service? How much before entry into service do we see that to pick back up?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I don't have perfect clarity about the precise timing of when orders will pick up, but it's our expectation building on the good sales we've had (29:39) that the closer these airplanes are to entry into service, our sales will pick up.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Phebe, can you comment on the capital deployment strategy and where your head is currently in terms of M&A? The market's gotten richer or cheaper in property, availability has gotten better or worse, and also the repurchase slowdown, is there anything to read there?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So on M&A, I really don't have any update for you, but if and when we do something, we'll let you know. We'll advise you. Jason, do you want to talk through the share repurchase?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think, Myles, for the balance, when you think about the year, our objectives, our targets for the year on deployment haven't changed. As you know, we were fairly on the active side in the first quarter of the year. And so we looked at the second quarter, and we feel like by the balance of the first half of the year we're right on track and doing exactly what we had hoped to do. We've deployed, as I said, two times our free cash flow on share repurchase and dividends. So I don't think you should see that as a signal of any directional shift for us at any time.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So the full year return on capital still targeted to be 100% of net income then?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's correct.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, and nice quarter.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a clarification and a question. I know, Phebe, you said the production plan didn't change, but I just wondered if you could clarify whether or not your cost plan changed at all. I know you had some cost reduction actions and furloughs. I didn't know if any of that changed from what you initially planned on. And then one for Jason, just on the FX front, I mean, you've called out the UK impact. I think, you've got a little bit of Swiss impact as well. What should we be thinking of in terms of forward impacts, if currencies stay where they are? Are there any transactional FX exposures that we should be aware of going forward? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So look, as I mentioned earlier, our margins at that level really aren't sustainable each and every quarter. But the G650 is contributing, and really it's cost management, cost reduction that's driving our margins. And so it's hard with perfect clarity to estimate the goodness that you can achieve until you're really in the moment. So we're continuing to manage our costs. I think we've got more way to go. And then at the same time, by the way, we've got to continue to improve the G650 and G280 operating margins, which we will do and are doing. And then we've got to ensure that the G400 and G500, or G450 and G500 maintain their profitability. And so I think that (33:05) very nice on track, particularly with respect to the latter.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So Carter, with respect to your foreign exchange question, you can think about our exposure as this way, in order of magnitude, if you will. It's really Canadian dollars, euros, pounds, and then Swiss francs sort of, in terms of magnitude. But the updated guidance that Phebe walked you through earlier was actually predicated on the latest rates we have at hand projected through the balance of the year. So that is the latest look at the impact, and it's not \u2013 I wouldn't call it material through the balance of the year, but we also don't necessarily take a bet on rates moving further one way or another. So if there is a further movement in the second half, we would obviously tell you about that and it could have an upside or a downside impact to that guidance. The last thing I would say is that there's no, absolutely zero, from our perspective, transactional exposure. This is all strictly, as we've discussed before, the translation for U.S. dollar reporting. Everything from a transactional perspective is hedged in, and has been working effectively up to this point.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ron.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Phebe, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update where we stand on the Ohio-class program, in terms of what's going on actually at Electric Boat, and then what you're looking for over the next coming quarters.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So if you've been following this, the Navy and Electric Boat have been active in a number of discussions. Most recently we delivered our Ohio Replacement Integrated Product and Process Development plan, and think about that as the detailed design and long lead material portion of the procurement process. So the Navy is reviewing that in the moment. I think their plan is to get back to us sometime late summer, early fall. But that's kind of their call in terms of the cadence of the timing. But that will provide, and should provide, depending when we close on that, some upside in this year. And then again, as we've talked before, this is a very strong growth engine for us over time.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So Phebe, how far are the G450 and G550 sold into next year? And I think, at one point you said you'd rather take down production than take down price. How large is that period between when that backlog ends and when we might see initial deliveries of the G500?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'm comfortable that we can manage this transition, and we are in good shape to either \u2013 we sold a fair number of the positions going into next year, particularly on the G450, and also on the G550. So the transition, the trick to the transition is, we've got to bring down the production on the G450, G550 while ramping up the production on the G500 and G600. The ease of this is somewhat benefited, or somewhat benefits, from the fact that these two sets of airplanes are built in completely different facilities. So, if you're suggesting that we have a gap, that's not an altogether bad thing, as long as we stay on schedule for our deliveries on the G500 and G600, which I see no reason why we can't at the moment, but we're in good shape for next year on the G450, G550. Got a little ways more to go, and then we'll set the production rate for the G500 and G600 as we move forward. So does that get to the essence of your question?","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us, maybe Jason, of the shortfall in cash flow, free cash flow, relative to net income this year, maybe in kind of qualitative terms, how much of that is related to the construction of flight test articles for G500 and G600? And do all those flight test articles go to customers, and so do all of those costs go into inventory?","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So the flight test articles do go into inventory, and eventually they'll go into long-term product design use or to customers. I would say, from a qualitative standpoint, the outsized impact on the cash flow differential is really more about the international program advances being drawn down. There's some impact on, not so much the flight test aircraft impacting Gulfstream so much as just inventory build toward production, but that's the minor share. The larger share really is about the international advance drawdown.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Hi, Phebe. Good morning.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","I wanted to pursue, you had four used sales in Gulfstream. Could you give us the revenues and approximate earnings? And I would assume that that would have deflated the margin you reported, as high as it was. So when you go to the second half and you have higher revenues, why does the margin be somewhat less than what it was this quarter? Thanks.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So George, I'll take that. The revenues for the quarter were right around $40 million, I believe, is the number for pre-owned, and as is typical, it's right around breakeven, maybe a $1 million or $2 million loss associated with those, which is pretty typical. If I understand your question, for the balance of the year we do have profiled, as we've talked about before, an expectation of additional pre-owned coming into inventory and being sold, which actually is consistent with the point Phebe made before, with a little bit of a downtick in margins, particularly in the third quarter. So I think those are consistent, unless I misunderstood your question about the balance of the year.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","No. I think it's right, Jason. I just thought that, to deliver four used planes in subsequent quarters, you're probably not going to do that much, maybe you will. So I was kind of figuring the used planes would be less, so you got a little less pressure on the profit and you got higher revenues.","Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Actually, a little bit more color on that, the planes in the quarter, there were four of them, but the mix of them, they were pretty modest in terms of revenue per unit. So that's not the assumption necessarily going forward. There are a lot of different mix in there, in terms of the inventory that we take in.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah (40:48). So think about it this way, George. We sold four in the quarter, which you know. We took in three and have sold one, so today we have two in inventory. But remember that the margin impact can vary depending on the aircraft itself.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. No, that's a good answer. And one quick one, Combat margin is usually the biggest in the fourth quarter, and yet your guidance is implying that second half won't be as good as the first half. So if you had a little explanation on that.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So we are in the third quarter and more importantly, in the fourth quarter beginning to move from our \u2013 as the domestic land forces contract, some of those begin to taper down, we are increasing our international production. So we've got \u2013 that's really the margin pressure. It's simply a question of mix. As long as operating performance is good, these guys have done very well, but they've got to come down their learning curves, right?","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Very good.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Phebe, can you give us any color on the customer mix or geography on all those mid cabins in the quarter that you sold? And was that order activity in line with your expectation on a dollar-based book-to-bill basis, or would you say you're slightly surprised with the upside? And sort of to that, can you talk about how wait times on the mids change in the quarter? Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So if I understand your question properly, our sales on the G280 were a little different, or a little better than we had anticipated. And I think that's just reflecting the strength of the North American market. So with respect to wait times, and let me give you this opportunity or take this opportunity to give you a little bit of color on the wait times, on the G650 and G650ER, we're about 24 months; G550 and G450, nine months to 12 months, no change; G280, nine months to 12 months; and the G150, we've got onesies and twosies left to sell there. So the first available there is a year from now.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. So on the G280, better than expected, that wasn't just timing, that was actually just \u2013 maybe you just won a few more awards that could have gone either way.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that, that's right. And it wasn't \u2013 that's always the case. We understand our customers' needs, but the order in which they want to execute the placement of their fleet will kind of depend on their imminent needs for the mission that a particular airplane serves. So the good news is, they're selling well, the G280s, but it does impact book-to-bill.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. Thank you.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Candice, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah, Phebe, I guess, I'll ask you one on the Navy subs program. I'm wondering how you think about \u2013 there seems to be some emerging chatter from the Democrats about the affordability of nuclear triad recapitalization. And I know you have some potential CapEx bills to pay as you think about what the rates are going to be. So how do you decide out of your CapEx profile there at Marine, given kind of the sizable bills the Navy is going to have to pay, and if they can pay those bills or not?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there is often chatter when we \u2013 and this has been true from the last time that we recapitalized our nuclear fleet, about the affordability of it. But this is really a national policy issue, and to the extent that the United States wants to maintain a nuclear deterrent, they've got to build this submarine. So that's number one. And that's my view. And I think that that's supported by many people in the government on both the Executive and the Congressional side. So I wouldn't say that Democratic \u2013 some chatter in the system suggest walking away from this requirement. So I think in terms of \u2013 the Navy has budgeted here a revenue flow to us that we can easily accommodate the CapEx and the other improvements that we have going forward in terms of the ability to build these. I might also tell you that we've been spending CapEx over the last few years to position ourselves, particularly at the Quonset Point, on the Ohio replacement. So we work very carefully with our Navy customer to determine what they need, what we need, the funding allocation, who's responsible for what, and we're certainly not going to get caught long.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Do you think ultimately you keep the Virginia rate at two per year?","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's the plan. In fact, we like that plan.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","I hear you. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today.
