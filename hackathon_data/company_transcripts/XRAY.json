Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. ","At this time I will like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. ","Derek Leckow","Thank you, Kyle. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. ","I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides and information relating to non-GAAP financials are available for download in the Investor Relation\u2019s section of our website, www.DENTSPLY.com under the heading quarterly results.","And don\u2019t forget the Safe Harbor language and U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today\u2019s release also pertain to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make today.","The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. ","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret. ","Bret Wise","Thank you Derek and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us again on the call this morning. I have just a few opening comments on the state of the markets, our strategic priorities, and then briefly on our results, and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim and Chris who will provide more details.","First on the markets, generally the trends that we saw earlier in the year continued in Q4. Overall, the global markets were reasonably stable with the exception of the CIS region which continued its steep decline. U.S. markets certainly is showing signs of life, probably at about the same pace as in Q3 or may be a little bit better. ","The European market, ex-CIS, remained flattish with some markets growing slowly and some contracting a bit, however, I will say there is a slight bias towards improvement there. The markets that we\u2019re growing, there are more of them and they are a little bit more robust and there are fewer markets that we are contracting.","The rest of the world was of course a mixed bag. The growth markets continued to be China, select countries in Asia; India, Middle East, and Canada, while Australia was stable and Japan and Brazil declined modestly. Overall, I\u2019d say the market trends are very consistent with what we saw earlier in the year, may be with a slight bias towards getting better.","Moving to DENTSPLY, we entered 2014 focused on new project launches and growth, but also on improving our efficiency in terms of operating margins, asset churns, and cash flow as priorities. We also established a target to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 20% by 2017, and that was off a 17.6% base in 2013. So, we are looking for approximately 240 basis points of improvement over that period of time. ","We made some good progress on these priorities in 2014, significantly increasing our operating margins, our asset churns, and our cash flow generation. We also are now moving several elements of the efficiency program from planning to implementation and thus we expect to see more improvements, substantially more progress over the next eight quarters or so.","It\u2019s also important to remember that this program is not only about efficiency and cost, but it\u2019s also about reducing fixed cost in favor of variable spending and investment in growth initiatives, in particular opportunities we see in research, clinical work, and customer facing areas of our global platform. Overall, there are some good signs of our progress in our reports this past year and we expect to build on those as we move through 2015 and 2016. ","Separately, based on our cash flow in 2014, we are now in a good position to re-deploy cash to benefit shareholders. You already began to see this in our share repurchase program in 2014, which accelerated notably from prior years, and we\u2019ll give you more details on that this morning. Of course, acquisitions also remain a high priority for us to the extent we can find attractive returns through acquisition growth as we move forward. ","Looking at the numbers, sales growth ex-PM was up 1.8% constant currency for the year, and the fourth quarter came in at a positive 2.1% constant currency with 1.9% of that being internal growth.","Regionally, internal growth in Q4 was strongest in the rest of world at a positive 3.4%, followed by Europe which was up 2.0%, and U.S. was up 0.7% in the quarter. Although retail growth was higher than that in the U.S. and you\u2019ll hear more about that this morning from Chris and Jim. Looking at underlying demand trends, we expect to see the U.S. growth pickup as we move through 2015 at this point.","Europe was up 2% and although this is a good number in and of itself considering the economic conditions, this was still significantly depressed by the CIS region. Internal sales growth in Europe ex-CIS was up 3.8% and that\u2019s the strongest growth we\u2019ve seen in that region since the beginning of the recession in 2008.","This builds on a pretty strong third quarter for us as well in Europe, which is of course encouraging at this point. However, we continue to believe that our growth there is quite a bit above the market growth, and although we see market improvement in 2015 as a distinct possibility in Europe, the risk of economic stability in the region remains very, very high. Sales in the rest of world were led by strong growth in Asia, modest improvements in Latin America, Canada, and Australia, and we\u2019re down in Japan and the Middle East. ","On a product category basis, our healthcare and dental specialty sales growth was the strongest, while chairside consumables including small equipment were low-single digits and lab was negative low-single digits. ","On earnings, operating margins expanded by 50 basis points in the quarter and were up 80 basis points for the full year. We\u2019ve shown a pretty consistent trend of improved operating margins throughout the year here, and I think that\u2019s a good sign for the impact of the programs we have instituted. ","Cash flow also improved significantly growing to $560 million for the year; that\u2019s up 34% compared to the prior year, and again I think both the margins and the cash flow generation reflect well in the efficiency program and our ability to turn earnings into cash flow as we work towards our long term ROIC target of 12% to 15%.","Going forward, we are emphasizing new product innovations and launches, a strong platform that we have for clinical education and procedural selling and investment in our sales force to ensure that they are the most knowledgeable group in the field. This combined with our efficiency program and reinvestment of our cash flows set the stage for growing shareholder value over time. ","Looking ahead to 2015, we are facing rather severe changes in currency exchange markets, which at the current rates will impact our results significantly. Derek\u2019s included a slide on currency, the change in currency exchange rates that he posted this morning on the website for you to see. We have programs in place to mute or offset some of the effects of the rate movement, however with 66% of our sales in international markets, the impact is still very substantial.","At current rates, we estimate the currency impacts net of hedging activities is approximately a $0.14 per share drag on earnings in 2015 versus 2014, and again that\u2019s net of our hedging activities. With this in mind and considering the market conditions and what we can achieve in our efficiency program net of the investments in that program, we are establishing initial expectations for adjusted earnings per share of 250 to 260 per share. ","So before I turn this over to Jim, overall operationally we believe the underlying performance of the company is moving along the trajectory towards the goals we\u2019ve put forth, namely operating margin expansion, improving our cash flows, and improving ROIC and we\u2019re optimistic about market growth expectations in certain key markets for 2015 to help boost results. Jim.","Jim Mosch","Thank you Bret. I would like to comment on operational highlights for Q4 in 2014 and provide some perspective on 2015, and I\u2019ll then turn it over to Chris. ","2014 saw lower than expected internal growth in the first half of the year and we saw improvement in Q3 and Q4. In the U.S. we saw good retail growth of our chairside consumables in the mid-single-digit range, although wholesale growth was muted. ","More specifically, our resources business saw continued performance from new products such as TPH Spectra, Prime&Bond Elect, and the Class II marketing campaign, all supporting excellent growth. In addition, our prevention hygiene businesses has leveraged new product launches such as NUPRO Varnish and Cavitron FITGRIP driving growth above consumables overall. This was somewhat offset by lab, which was negative driven by declines in traditional lab products.","Outside the U.S., we saw a real acceleration in the chairside consumable categories. In Q4, Western Europe internal growth was up mid-single digits and Asia was up double digits, which helped to counter very slow growth in Latin America and contraction in CIS. ","Looking to our healthcare business, we continue to leverage previous launches of the Origo male catheter and Sense [ph] female catheter and healthcare grew nicely in the quarter in both Europe and the U.S.","Of the products launch in Q4 we have been very pleased with the success of both the Midwest E Electric handpiece and the TRUSHAPE dental retention endodontic system. The Midwest E has provided an entrance into the growing electric handpiece segment. Response has been excellent and sales were XXX expectations in Q4. In addition, TRUSHAPE has been well received by the endodontic community and the minimally invasive and dental retention attributes has resonated with clinicians.","Turning to our implant business we\u2019ve had excellent acceptance of the new Astra Tech EV implant system, which now represents greater than 50% of our Astra Tech implant system, all which was occurred in the first year of launch. As indicated, we had a delayed start in the U.S. and Germany as the conversion rate exceeded demand, leading to inventory liquidation as clinicians transitioned to the new system.","We forecasted recovery in the back half, which we saw in Q3. In Q4 total implant performance improves sequentially to mid single digits constant currency growth. Our implant performance was driven by growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world and Europe was positive despite the 200 basis point headwind from Russia CIS.","In 2014 we completed the integration of our digital businesses, which is Atlantis Abutments, Isus bars and bridges and materialized surgical guides. These products are now being sold by the DENTSPLY implant sales organization. Through this effort we have seen high single digit growth of our digital portfolio and solid growth in each product group.","As we discussed throughout the year, operational effectiveness was a key focus area. This came in a form of several facility consolidations in U.S. and Europe, cost reduction initiatives and networking capital improvement. These efforts delivered cost savings, gross margin improvement, operating margin expansion throughout 2014.","In Q4 we had solid networking capital improvement with the six-day inventory reduction and operating margin improved 50 basis points and we also had record cash flow. These results added to a good performance throughout the year. Chris will discuss these in more detail. ","As we enter 2015 we will continue our operational initiatives and we will work to deliver operating margin expansion and networking capital improvement. Commercially we look forward to the IDS in Cologne, German in March as in the past we will have the DENTSPLY village with all dental divisions represented, new products will be the theme and we expect to launch 12 new products at the show with some strictly important launches in our lab and endodontic businesses.","In addition to innovation, we will focus heavily on expanding and developing our sales organization and increasing our clinical education initiatives, which we believe are all directly alighted with our success in the market. ","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.","Chris Clark","Thank you Jim. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and our full year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also providing some additional color on our balance sheet and cash flow. ","The fourth quarter sales excluding precious metals decline 3.2% compared to the prior year, as internal growth of 190 basis points and net impact from acquisitions of 20 basis points were more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 530 basis points.","Internal growth was 0.7% in the U.S. and was negatively impacted by the headwind from channel inventory contractions associated with purchasing ahead of our October price increase that we mentioned on our third quarter call, as well as the 180 basis point headwind from lower small equipment sales compared to a very strong prior year base that included a major new product launch. ","From a retail standpoint our growth in the U.S. was much better than this and we expect this to continue as we move into 2015. European internal growth was 2.0% in the quarter including 3.8% excluding Russia CIS, which continues to contract well into double digits as a result of the economic and political situation there. ","For the quarter Russia CIS was a headwind to our global internal growth figure by approximately 80 basis points. Our rest of the world internal growth of 3.4% in the quarter was led by particularly strong performances in the Pacific Rim as Bret mentioned. ","Gross profit on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 57.4% of sales excluding precious metals, which was an improvement of 90 basis points over prior year and reflects the favorable impact of price, mix, FX and some of our recent operational improvement efforts, partially offset by lower absorption as we took out inventory in the period. ","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.6% of sales excluding precious metals. That\u2019s up 30 basis points compared to our rate in the fourth quarter 2013 and includes some heavier spending associated with our operational improvement initiatives, consistent with our comments on the third quarter call.","Operating margin for the quarter improved by 50 basis points to 17.7% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, and that compares to 17.2% in the fourth quarter last year and reflects the gross margin SG&A impact that I just described. ","Currency represented a headwind of earnings in the quarter of between $0.02 and $0.03 per share and that was approximately three quarters of $0.001 worse than what we anticipated on the third quarter earnings call, and the U.S. dollar strengthens subsequent to that call and drove an incremental unfavorable translation headwind. ","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9%, while our operating tax rate was 22.1%, which was 130 basis points above our fourth quarter rate last year. You will recall that we mentioned on our third quarter call that we anticipated an unfavorable comparison to prior year quarter in the tax line, primarily as a result of unfavorable geographic mix.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the fourth quarter was $84.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share and that compares to $74.4 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the release. ","On an adjusted basis net earnings were $86.6 million in the quarter, down slightly from $87.9 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50 per share, down from $0.61 for last year.","Our results include the headwinds that we anticipated on our third quarter call including currency, tax, incremental investments to support our operating and margin improvements and our modest contraction of channel inventories as a result of purchases ahead of the October price increase. Although the net impact of these items was probably a bit worse than what we anticipated. ","Transitioning now to the full year results for 2014. Sales excluding precious metals were 0.8% compared to the prior year, including 120 basis points of internal growth, 60 basis points from net acquisitions and negative currency translation impact of 100 basis points. The headwinds in CIS had a negative impact on the internal growth of 70 basis points on our global number for the year and after providing a pretty nice benefit to the internal growth in 2013. For the year the U.S. comprised 34% of our global sales, while Europe represented 45% and the rest of the world region represented 21%. ","Operating margin for the year improved 80 basis points to 18.4% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis. That compares to 17.6% last year. We are pleased with this improvement in operating leverage, particularly given the slower than ideal market conditions we face during much of the year particularly in Europe.","On an adjusted basis net earnings for the year increased to $361 million from $341.2 million in 2013 and adjusted earnings per share grew 6% to $2.50 per diluted share from $2.35 per diluted share in 2013. ","Our results for the year include a negative impact from currency of approximately $0.04 per share, which is generally in line with what we anticipated in our initial guidance for the year. Based on current rates, currency is a much larger headwinds for us in 2015 and I\u2019ll describe that in more detail in a moment. ","Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the year was a record $560.4 million. That\u2019s up 34% from $417.8 million last year. While free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures grew 45% to $461 million from $318 million a year ago. This improvement reflects earnings growth and the improved working capital performance and also continued tax benefits associated with recent acquisitions. As a result, our free cash flow conversion was strong at 143% of reported net income for the year, while our trailing 12-month free cash flow yield now stands north of 6%. ","Our cash flow performance allowed us to continue to take a more balanced approach to capital deployment as we move through the year, including acquisitions and share buy backs. In the fourth quarter we completed one acquisition in Europe, as well as two small divestitures, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, none of these were material to our financial results.","In the fourth quarter we also accelerate our share repurchases by buying back over 1.7 million shares in the quarter at an average cost of $52.88 per share. For the full year the company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares. We ended 2014 with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 32.4% compared to 35.2% at the end of 2013 and 48.2% right after the Astra Tech acquisition. ","Looking forward, our balance sheet provides us considerable flexibility to deploy capital through acquisitions and share buybacks. ","Inventories now standard at 113 days, which is down six days compared to September, down 10 days from June and down one day compared to December 2013. For the year our inventory pattern was pretty consistent with what we anticipated as we had indicated that inventories would drop in the second half of 2014, after increasing previously as a resulted transition plants associated with anticipated operational changes.","Looking ahead, we anticipate continued progress in this area recognizing that there is some seasonality to our inventory patterns, as inventories will tend to increase a bit in the first half of the year. ","Accounts receivable days were 55 days the ended December, just down seven days from the prior quarter to down one day compared to December 2013. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $100 million, while depreciation was $81 million and amortization was $48 million. ","As we move into 2015, we are pleased with the operating performance of the business, particularly the improvements driving our operating margin rate and cash flow performance. Well our assumptions for 2015 include continued improvements in both these areas, we are also reflecting a series of unprecedented moves in foreign currency rates over the last 60 days, including significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies, as well as the significant weakening of the Euro relative to the Swiss Frank. ","The U.S. Dollar is now 14% stronger relative to the Euro than it was on average in 2014, with similar strengthening across other key currencies, including the Swedish Krona, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and British Pound. At current rates these movements would create an unfavorable impact to our sales results for 2015 of about 800 basis points. ","With respect to earnings, at current rates the impact to adjusted EPS for 2015 would be approximately $0.14 per share, reflecting a substantial benefit from our cash flow heading program. Absent the impact from the hedges, the earnings headwind from FX would be about double the $0.14 that we are currently facing. These hedges helped to partially blend our FX impact over a rolling 18-month period. While they do not eliminate or reduce the long-term impact of currency changes they do reduce the volatility by essentially gradualizing rate changes. ","Longer-term, one target benefit of our operating margin improvement initiatives is a standardized production processes across similar facilities, allowing us to flex a portion of our production between plants and geographies based on the number of factors, including currency movements. In the near term we are accelerating targeted actions to address specific costs and pricing opportunities as a result of the currency challenge. ","As we provided our 2015 earnings guidance I want to point out that this is on a non-GAAP basis, and excludes the impact of amortization, restructuring related activities and fair market value adjustments on derivatives, financial instruments and pensions. ","As Bret stated, we are establishing our 2015 earnings per share guidance as $2.50 to $2.60 on an adjusted basis. Our guidance reflects the impact of the incremental current headwind of approximately $0.14 per share and the non-GAAP adjustments that I mentioned earlier. ","In addition, our guidance reflects an anticipated 50 basis points headwind in our 2015 tax rate compared to 2014\u2019s rate and that\u2019s a result of projected unfavorable geographic earnings mix. There may be some opportunity to prove on the tax rate as we move through the year; we\u2019ll just have to see. ","That completes our prepared remarks. We certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019ll now be glad to take any questions that you might have. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob today. Chris, first question for you. You just mentioned the ability to maybe shift manufacturing and costs across geographies to offset some of the FX impact. I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail on how big of an opportunity is this, and is there an benefit from doing this assumed in your guidance. ","Chris Clark","Yes, Nathan. As we look at that, that\u2019s certainly one of the longer-term objectives associated with the operating margin improvement initiatives. As we look at it, we have plants that make similar products, not always necessarily the exact same product or using the exact same process in terms of manufacturing process. ","So one of our objectives of the initiative is frankly to standardize that on a much more common basis allowing some plants that are producing similar products to actually produce the same products in the same manner, and that would allow us over time to flex production back and forth based on a number of different factors, including FX. ","I would say that we have some limited capability to-date to do that. I would say that that is a longer term objective, and while there may be a little bit of help in that in 2015, I would say that\u2019s really more of a longer term benefit that we see from the program. ","Nathan Rich","Great. Thanks and then Bret you talked about U.S. growth being a little bit soft, and I understand I guess there was some pull forward ahead of the price increase in October. Could you just maybe talk about your expectations for 2015 in the U.S. Do you see that internal growth rate kind of improving throughout the year and then also internationally just kind of any impact on kind of the sales and earnings cadence around the IDS Show?","Bret Wise","Okay Nathan, quickly our U.S. growth was muted for the reasons that both Jim and Chris covered. I do think that the U.S. market has accelerated somewhat as we move through the year, and there is no reason not to expect it won\u2019t accelerate going forward, and that\u2019s why in our comments we said we expect our own internal growth in the U.S. to accelerate as we move through 2015, so we are reasonably comfortable with that. ","On international and the effects of the IDS, the IDS is not a big selling show for consumables. Meaning, we go to the show, we demonstrate our new products, and then over a subsequent month or subsequent quarters we try to get back to those dentists or those customers and re-engage on the new technology. So, we don\u2019t usually see a big boost in short-term growth from the IDS, in fact what we see is a big boost in spending for the IDS. It is quite an expensive show. ","So if we look at first quarter, our first quarter, it\u2019s probably going to be the most challenging quarter we have for the reasons stated there, that we are likely \u2013 I think that U.S. growth will accelerate its growth through the year that will help us. It\u2019s probably more back-end loaded than front-end loaded, and spending will probably be front end loaded, both on the efficiency programs and on trade shows, the IDS being the largest. ","But it usually doesn\u2019t resolve in a quick ramp-up in sales, it\u2019s more a precursor to sales later in the year. ","Nathan Rich","Great, thanks for the color. ","Bret Wise","Thank you. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. ","Jeff Johnson ","Thank you. Good morning guys, how are you?","Bret Wise","Good morning Jeff. ","Chris Clark","Good morning Jeff. ","Jeff Johnson ","Good. Just wondering Chris maybe we could just start on the Russia CIS. You\u2019ve been helpful the last few quarters providing the breakout there, but we are starting to bump-up against the much easier comps there. Should we still expect down -- on top of down comps over the next few quarters or just what\u2019s going on in that business. Obviously the geo-political stuff is still an issue there. ","Chris Clark","Yes I think you have a couple of factors going on. Obviously, it is very unstable from an economic situation. We think that the demand levels are continuing to drop. Certainly, we are not seeing any sequentially improvements if they are continuing to decline in double digits, and so from that angle, I think that\u2019s an indication that it really has not stabilized. ","First quarter, we began to run-up against the base. So, from that angle, we are running against a base that declined as opposed to a base that improved, but I guess I would say that, that base has continued to decline the subsequent three quarters. ","So again, I guess all I can say at this stage is it\u2019s highly uncertain and certainly we would hope that it stabilizes, and that\u2019s historically been a nice growth market for us, but it\u2019s been a pretty significant headwind, and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to flip around anytime soon. ","Jeff Johnson ","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then Bret going back to some of your comments on the first question there around margins, you know margins continue to impress this quarter. I think it\u2019s seven straight quarters here that you guys have put up some very solid margin improvement. Is it fair to think though, we have to think of those margins kind of flattening out. I\u2019m just trying to read your comments on the IDS spending and the kind of improvement on the U.S. organic throughout the year. Would it be kind of flat to start the year and then some nice expansion as we exit the year or how to think about that margin gating?","Chris Clark","Yes, thanks Jeff. You know, I think for the full year, we are comfortable in saying we are going to see continued margin improvement in 2015. Part of that\u2019s our self-help program and part of that\u2019s I think the opportunity for faster growth in the U.S. in particular. I do think quarter is always hard to predict. First quarter, I think is going to be the most challenging for the spending that you commented on. So I don\u2019t really have high expectations for the first quarter for margin improvement. I think it will be more backend loaded in the year this year.","Jeff Johnson ","All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then just Chris back on the FX, issues for the year. It sounds like you are saying that about 50% of the impact flows through this year and obviously currency is going to be volatile over coming months and quarters in that, I\u2019m sure. So is that kind of a flow though rate we should be thinking of. I know its varied anywhere from 50% flow-through to a 100% flow through over the last few years. But is that \u2013 with the hedging in place kind of 50% the right number at this point. ","Chris Clark","Yes, at this point in time Jeff, that\u2019s correct. I mean recognize that the caveat for this is highly volatile, right. I mean these rates are flipping around significantly, constantly almost hour by hour. ","So yes, as we sit here today, we think the headwind in approximately $0.14 in terms of earnings at current rates for the impact on 2015. But that includes about that size of benefit in that net number from the cash flow hedges. ","Those cash flow hedges again, I guess they anniversary themselves, they go away. So again, the gross impact is basically close to double that $0.14. ","Jeff Johnson ","Yes, okay. Thanks guys. Yes got it thanks. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. I have one longer-term cash flow question; I guess that would be for Chris. You guys have given us a pretty helpful roadmap for how you think about margins improving over time. The cash flow improvement in 2014 was obviously very strong. Would you be willing to speak to a longer-term view, maybe through 2017, just to be consistent with the commentary on the margin improvement? ","You know thinking about how you can grow, either operating a fee cash flow over that period of time. We know margins keep improving, but obviously you\u2019ve had some improvements on the balance sheet as well. Can you give us a sense for how that flows from here? Thanks.","Bret Wise","Yes, I guess I would say Steve that as we think about the objectives of our self health program as Bret describes it, obviously margins are certainly one of that and the other piece frankly is to continue to improve our ROIC and by basically addressing the asset base, including working capital. ","We think we have opportunities over time to continue to improve in the working capital side. Again, that\u2019s going to be a gradual improvement, but we think that we showed some improvement, solid improvement in 2014. We\u2019re hoping to continue to, we expect to continue to drive that in \u201915 and beyond. ","So I think that as we think about the cash flow opportunities, I think the cash flow opportunity is really too full. No one, it improved earnings as a result of the operating margin improvement and then secondly the improvements in networking capital over time. So I mean again, I think that growth certainly drives it as well I guess would be the third factor in the context of as today\u2019s markets improves and internal growth improves and then that\u2019s obviously a factor as well. So those three things would cause me to say over time we would expect that to continue to improve.","Steve Beuchaw","And then I want to follow up on implants. I wonder if you\u2019d be willing to give us any geographic and deconstruction of how the growth was looking in your implant business towards the end of the year. How do you see it into next year? ","And then while we are on the topic of implants, given the amount of strategic activity going on in the implant market, are you seeing any opportunities for commercial traction, incremental share gains or maybe a bit of opportunity to capitalize on attrition given the amount of activity out there? Thanks.","Jim Mosch","Yes Steve, this is Jim Mosch. As I mentioned in my comments, I think one of the things that we relied on significantly in 2014 was the EV launch. As I mentioned, we\u2019re probably ahead about 50%, a little more than a 50% conversion level of that system and I will also say that that\u2019s been pretty evenly distributed. We saw continued sequential growth in the U.S., so we\u2019re kind of pleased with that position. I think we recognize that we needed improvement in that area from early in the year. We saw that in Q3 and Q4 and we expect that to continue into 2015.","Likewise Europe was strong ex-CIS. CIS has been a challenge. That\u2019s a pretty sizable market for us and we don\u2019t expect to see a lot of improvement in that situation in 2015. As Chris mentioned, it\u2019s very, very volatile. From the rest of the world situation we\u2019ve seen improvement in the Pacific Rim through 2014. ","So as I look at it I believe that we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019re seeing nice growth in our digital portfolio. We have continued traction in the EV system and we would expect to continue to improve in the overall implant business.","On the commercial side, I think we\u2019re going to be absorbing EV really throughout 2015. We do have some new opportunities. We will have some product additions that we\u2019ll show at the IDS as it relates to Atlantis and our digital portfolio and we expect to kind of get some continued growth from that segment, but as far as a major commercial shift, I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon.","Steve Beuchaw","Very helpful. Thanks Jim.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. ","Brandon Couillard","Thanks, good morning. Bret, back on the U.S. business, just to make sure I heard this right, did you say that the hand piece comp was a 80 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter and then could you parse out just the tier side consumables trend and how that shaped up in the fourth quarter relative to sort of the runway we see in the last three periods.","Chris Clark","Sure Bran, I\u2019ll take a shot at that and Chris may need to interject here as well. On the small equipment decline year-over-year there\u2019s a couple of factors there. One is that we had a large launch last year. It was Aquasil Cordless was the launch and so that\u2019s a piece of equipment that goes along with an impression material, suite of products that\u2019s called \u2013 that was very successful last year and it created a big baseline for us to get over this year.","But secondly we saw small equipment generally slow down in the fourth quarter and diverge from the growth rates of consumables. That happens from time to time, but not that often and when it does diverge significantly we call it out. I would assume that that\u2019s temporary and its probably going to play itself out here over the next few quarters as those two growth rates, consumables and small equipment kind of return to a common norm. ","As far as consumables themselves, the chairside consumable component of our business grew retail quite nicely in the fourth quarter. I would say at a kind of an accelerating pace. Now it was [indiscernible] hidden by the small equipment impact and also the slight destocking coming out of the third quarter price increases. ","But I think Jim commented that we\u2019re in mid single digits in those products. We had some encouraging reports on that market from one large distributor earlier in the month and like we mentioned, we think that that consumable segment is going to continue to accelerate going into \u201915 in the U.S. So we\u2019re reasonably optimistic about that market.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks and then Chris, in terms of the outlook for next year, can you give us some parameters around operating cash flow in CapEx and then just to clarify, does the guidance contemplate any contribution from incremental share repurchases?","Bret Wise","The guidance at this point basically includes the share repurchase that had been done as well as offset of future equity dilution. So from that angle that\u2019s pretty consistent with the way we typically provide guidance at the beginning of the year. ","CapEx, at this point I would estimate that we\u2019re forecasting in the $110 million range for the year and relative to cash flow I would expect I mean obviously we\u2019re coming off an enormous base. I would expect a modest improvement, slight improvement for the year as we continue to make improvement in terms of working capital. But again, it actually would probably not be the same level of improvement that we saw in terms of 2014 over 2013.","Brandon Couillard","Super. Thank you.","Bret Wise","You bet.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. The 1.9% organic constant dollar growth that I think you had in the fourth quarter, can you give us a sense about what the price component of that was?","Bret Wise","Yes, as we look at it, let me ask the question John via the margin line, which did improve obviously about 90 basis points in the quarter. Price was a component of that. We did typically take our price increases on many of our businesses October 1. Our price increase overall was in the 1.5% range and we think that most of that appears to have stuck at lease in the quarter. So again, that\u2019s not on all of our businesses globally, but that\u2019s on again I guess our U.S. consumables business and several of our international business. So again, there is no doubt that price is a component of the 1.9% growth, but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s every bit of it.","John Kreger","Great, thanks. So Chris given that, can you just talk a little bit more about this destocking effect that you saw in the U.S. I assume that\u2019s behind you. Do you feel like inventory levels out in the channel are pretty reasonable and stable or might we see any more of that as we move through early \u201915?","Bret Wise","Yes, I know. We think at this point John we\u2019re kind of entering the year at a pretty normal basis. We called out on the third quarter call that we thought that again, a few of the distributors might have gone in a little bit deeper if you will in terms of price increased pre buy activity in the quarter. Interest rates were low and that gives us obviously as we take price increases, that\u2019s how they put it through their models and make a determination in terms of what the return in terms of going deeper on key products might be and we call that out in terms of it being a potential impact. ","Obviously it\u2019s always a little bit hard to tell in the exact amount of that, but again that was pretty much in line I would say in the fourth quarter with what we anticipated on the third quarter call. And again, we think we\u2019re entering unbalanced, entering the year again in a pretty stable position. Again, there\u2019s going to be individual businesses, plus and minus and individual geographies plus and minus, but I think overall pretty balanced.","John Kreger","That\u2019s all for it, thanks. Maybe one last one; particularly in the U.S. and Europe, do you have any visibility to the underlying customer type and what sort of growth your seeing into lets say the kind of smaller practice versus larger or\/and corporate accounts. Are you seeing any differential in growth rates into those two classes.","Bret Wise","Yes, as it relates to that, I mean we certainly recognize that in certain geographies, we see it in the U.S., we see a little bit in the UK. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of activity in Canada, this kind of this rise of Corporate Dentistry. I would say that we\u2019ve had very favorable impact in those type of customers, because we have such a broad portfolio and we are able to leverage that portfolio and our clinical education programs to be able to address the needs of those types of practices. ","I wouldn\u2019t say at this point in time we\u2019ve seen such a shift and it\u2019s a major, major change where we see a major shift between group or corporate customers versus individual practices. We haven\u2019t seen that phenomena as of yet.","John Kreger","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Block with Stifel. ","Ethan Roth","Hi, thanks. This is Ethan Roth on for John. The implant business was up mid-single digits over the second consequently quarter. Last quarter you provided some commentary on the Astra Tech EV system. You mentioned that one third of conversions were coming from new customers. Are you still tracking towards similar levels of competitive conversions?","Bret Wise","Yes Ethan, I would say that that\u2019s probably fallen off a little bit and that\u2019s primary as we\u2019ve gotten into the larger markets of the U.S. and Germany where we obviously have much larger businesses, much larger number of customers, so there is really a capacity issues of our ability to address the needs of those customers. However, we are still seeing a good number of conversions of new customs with our EV system. But I would not say it\u2019s at that one-third level. ","Ethan Roth","Okay, great. And then just on the 2017 operating margin goal of 20%, what impact if any has the current changes in the FX had on that and since you are still maintaining that target, does that imply modest improvement you are thinking, just on the core margin expansion. Thanks. ","Bret Wise","Yes, as we look at 2014 FX was actually a little bit of headwinds, by headwind overall for the year in terms of operating margin rate. As we looked at 2015 at current rates its actually going to flip around and be a bit of a help as the drag on the top line is going to be a little bit more than the drag on the bottom line. ","As we think about the 20%, our objective is 20% in 2017, regardless of the FX situation and so you know again, I do think there maybe a little bit of noise give or take here as we have individual periods with FX changes. But again, I think the key core for us is to keep on focusing on the underlying improvement of business and obviously we are pleased with the progress in 2014. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette with UBS. ","Steven Valiquette","Yes thanks, I literally had the exact same question that was just asked. So I\u2019m all set now thanks?","Bret Wise","Okay, thanks Steve. ","Chris Clark","Thanks Steve. ","Operator","And we will take our final question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America.","Erin Wilson ","Great, thanks for taking my questions. In implants have you seen any sort of meaningful changes in pricing or the competitive dynamics across the implant business in light of industry consolidation and how do you envision that market evolving over the next year, but also longer term and you can speak to high end versus value as well?","Bret Wise","Certainly. From a standpoint of meaningful change pricing wise, we\u2019ve not seen that to-date. In fact as we look at the premium implant segment, one phenomena we have seen is that implant unit growth has increased and certainly it\u2019s taken a couple of years for that to happen. The other thing we see is that average sell prices are fairly stable and in some cases we are seeing increases. So from the standpoint of the premium implant segment it is defiantly improving and I think you see that in the performance of certainly asking some of our competitors. The industry consolidation you speak of, obviously that is actually happening as we speak. So I don\u2019t think \u2013 we\u2019ve yet to see the full impacts of what will happen with Nobel and Zimmer 3i. I think that will come down the road. ","As far as the longer period of time, I think that\u2019s a little bit difficult to predict. Certainly we recognize that in certain geographic segments value is very important, value implants are very important and you need those systems to have access to broader market. And certainly we will look at those opportunities. ","Erin Wilson ","Okay, great and on capital deployment what you are looking at from an acquisition standing? Do you anticipate greater opportunities in 2015 relative to 2014? What types of acquisitions would you be potentially targeting here and on the flip side of that should we anticipate any further divestitures or the emphasis of certain product lines as part of your operational initiatives and would that be incorporated into your guidance. Thanks. ","A - Bret Wise ","Okay Erin, on acquisitions, both acquisitions and divestitures we haven\u2019t done yet, are not incorporated into our guidance at all. I would say that we are a little bit more optimistic about acquisitions. The ability to execute acquisitions in \u201915 than we were in \u201914, so we are activity involved in that. I think predicting how much and when is the dangerous game because there is huge timing risk and execution risk on acquisitions. ","But I think its fair to say that we are interested in growing by acquisition, our balance sheet is in pretty good shape right now. We said in \u201914, we are repeating in \u201915 to the extent that aren\u2019t acquisitions, we\u2019ll likely be more active in share buybacks. You say us pick up the phase in share buybacks in 2014 as well. ","So to us its kind of an either or type equation right now, to the extent there is transactions available, we\u2019ll probably transact them. Its important that they fit into the our timing for the efficiency program as well, meaning they are stable enough that we could leave them outside the efficiency program for a while or they could easily be integrated while we are doing the efficiency program as well. So we take that into account as another factor. But I think we are more optimist about the ability to pull cash, to create shareholder value that we have been for some time in the business. ","Erin Wilson ","Okay great, thanks so much. ","Bret Wise","Thank you. ","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. ","A - Bret Wise","Okay, thank you all for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. If you other questions I\u2019m available today for follow-up, and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming dental shows in Chicago and at the IDS . ","Thanks a lot. Bye.

At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. ","Derek Leckow ","Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s third quarter 2014 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. I\u2019d like to point out that a copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides and information relating to non-GAAP financials are available for download in the investor relation\u2019s section of our website www.DENTSPLY.com under the heading events and presentation.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and US GAAP reconciliation contained in today\u2019s press release also pertains to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements regarding risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings. It is possible that the actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make today.","The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the day of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise.","Bret W. Wise ","I\u2019m going to start with a few observations on the market and our own performance and then hand it off to Jim and Chris for more details. Starting with the markets, overall we would say that the global dental consumable markets are stable, not accelerating a lot at this point but also with a few notable exceptions, no real slowing. The US market is showing some signs of life, particularly in chair side consumables which may be picking up a bit. That\u2019s important because this is a very large category with many industry participants and frankly, it\u2019s an area where we\u2019re having a very good year.","In Europe, Q3 is of course, a tough benchmark because of the summer holiday period tends to be a one month quarter, but we would say that generally we\u2019ve seen some slight improvements with notable exception of the CIS region Russia and Ukraine are still quite negative. But ex CIS we saw modest improvements across a broad range of countries and a broad range of products throughout Europe. This was a broader kind of improvement than we\u2019ve seen for some time in Europe and we realize this is a bit contrary to the recent economic news coming out of the region so it\u2019s not clear whether this is indicative of a broader market trend or simply an improvement of our own performance over this period of time.","Rest of world continues to be a mixed bag, looks pretty strong in Asia and the Middle East. Australia seems to be better despite a significant weakening of the currency while Brazil remains slow and Japan remained modestly negative, I think still suffering a bit from the excise tax hangover that occurred in March. But overall, we would say there\u2019s no big news in the market conditions one way or the other. Pretty stable conditions throughout the globe. ","For our own performance, internal growth picked up a bit in the quarter. We were up 2.4% and we were positive in all of the US, Europe, and rest of world. Overall, we had sales growth ex PM of 1.8%, that was helped mostly by the internal growth which I mentioned was 2.4% and acquisitions added a modest 0.6% so constant currency was 3.0% in the quarter. Currency translation was more negative than when we entered the quarter, we ended up down 1.2% because of currency so constant currency 3.0%, negative currency 1.2% yields the 1.8% growth.","Internal growth was 2.0% in the US, was positive 1.0% in Europe and interestingly, it was up 2.4% without CIS in Europe. As I mentioned, that\u2019s a pretty notable improvement. Internal growth in rest of world regions was 5.9%, that was led by strong performance in the emerging market countries. Growth by category and these are global categories was strongest in the chairside consumables followed by the dental specialties and medical while lab continued to be slightly negative driven by weakness in Europe.","On operational execution we continued to implement changes to improve our margins in this low growth environment. We saw good market expansion for the third quarter running. We were up 80 basis points this quarter and at this point we\u2019re also up 80 basis points in the year-to-date area so pretty consistent margin improvement throughout the year. This gives us an adjusted EPS growth of just under 9% in the quarter which is up nicely against a 12% EPS growth, that\u2019s adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter last year. So we were up against a reasonably tough base period. Adjusted EPS is also up 8.5% to 9% for the year-to-date, so through nine months.","When we entered the year we had stated that margin expansion and improving asset turns were important objectives for this year while continuing to invest in future growth initiatives. I think the margin expansion that we see here is good evidence that we\u2019re making strong progress on margins while asset management has also been quiet strong with operating cash flows growing close to 40% year-to-date. We\u2019re pleased with these results given the low growth environment. We believe the actions we\u2019re taking today will facilitate stronger earnings growth even in a low growth environment like we\u2019re in today but much higher earnings growth when markets return to more normal growth rates.","We\u2019re moving forward on a number of fronts to improve the operational execution. This quarter we announced that we\u2019re in talks with the Works Council in Germany to improve the performance of the European lab business. This initiative will become more clear over the next couple of quarters based on the progression of those discussions. Another area of emphasis is consolidating or reducing certain product lines and eliminating SKUs where it\u2019s optimal to our operating performance. This will likely result in our discontinuing some low margin product lines but also will result in improved asset returns and returns on invested capital. We\u2019ll update you more on that as we move through the fourth quarter here and into next year.","Of course with a strong cash flow comes improvements in our balance sheet giving us more flexibility for external investments such as acquisitions and also returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, and Chris is going to speak more to that. So, as we execute three we\u2019re updating our earnings guidance for the full year to adjusted EPS of $2.49 to $2.53. We have some very good opportunities but also some significant currency and tax headwinds in the fourth quarter and also some cost headwinds based on some reinvestment plans that we have and Chris will give you more on that in a moment.","As far as 2015, we\u2019re going to defer discussing or giving guidance on 2015 until we report our fourth quarter and the full year results and that\u2019s the normal schedule that we follow, so we\u2019ll give that to you in February. That concludes my prepared remarks, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Jim now for some operational comments. ","James G. Mosch ","I\u2019d like to provide a brief perspective on a few operational items and then turn it over to Chris for the financial review. As indicated previously, we have undertaken several initiatives to improve our operating performance. In September, we announced that we had proposed steps to reorganize elements of our German laboratory business and the associated manufacturing capabilities. We are seeking to realign our portfolio of laboratory products with increased focus on innovative prosthetic materials while deemphasizing the [inaudible] the business. As required under German law, the company has entered into a statutory co-determination process with the appropriate labor groups. ","Last quarter we outlined the consolidation of our RINN and Sultan divisions into DENTSPLY\u2019s professional based in York Pennsylvania. Our objective was two-fold, first to create a global preventative and infection control business and second, to drive operating efficiencies. In October, this consolidation was completed, operations have been transferred and the new structure is now operational. ","It\u2019s important to note that on a year-to-date basis, both of these businesses are growing above market, both Sultan and RINN and the RINN business in particular has benefitted from additional sales focus from the professional division. This is important given that as we go through a restructuring that we maintain topline growth. ","In addition to above, we have also launched a global strategic sourcing initiative. We recognize that given the nature of our global business with multiple manufacturing facilities and distribution locations, we have created a complex supply chain environment. While we\u2019re at the very early stages, we believe that there are significant opportunities for improvement in both asset management and cost reduction.","Turning to the performance of our business groups, we are pleased with the performance of our consumable business specific to restorative and preventative and infection control portfolios. In both portfolios we are growing above market and increasing market share. Restoratives has benefitted from a string of new products such as TPH Spectra, Aquasil Cordless, prime and bond elect, and smartlite. These products in combination with the market leading SDR bulk-fill composite, and the palodent plus matrix system has supported an innovative marketing campaign focused on Class II restorations, one of the most commonly used procedures in dentistry. This is resonating positively with clinicians. ","Similarly our preventative and infection control business has also grown by entering new categories with products such as new pro fluoride varnish and new pro freedom cordless prophy system and the expanding of leading brand portfolios such as Cavitron and Sultan. ","Our lab business has been challenged after a decade long decline of precious metal alloys. Although this decline has slowed and maybe near bottom. With this, we see some good opportunities to meet the needs of our lab customers by improving our traditional lab portfolio and providing a broader suite of next generation materials and digital services that help our customers perform their work more efficiently and better outcomes for the end customers and their patients. ","Turning to our implant business, it has improved sequentially as competency and effectiveness continues to improve at the field level. In the quarter, implants grew mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in line with the overall implant market. Growth has been driving by the launch of the Astra Tech implant system and double digit growth of our digital implant portfolio. In the quarter we saw all three regions: US; Europe; and rest of world show growth in our implant business. ","We anticipate that XiVE will continue to fuel growth as we further penetrate the larger markets. To-date the feedback has been very positive and the conversion rate is greater than anticipated. In addition one-third of the conversions are coming from new customers. ","In regards to new products our Midwest division which markets and manufacturers high and low speed dental hand pieces and dental burs launched the Midwest E Electric handpiece at the recent ADA. The new electric handpiece has several unique features which allow our Midwest business compete in the important and growing electric handpiece segment. This is a category where we have not been competitive in a meaningful way historically so we believe there is a good potential for this product line addition.","While the Midwest business is a market leader in dental handpiece and the bur business in North America, it is not widely marketed outside this region with the earlier launch of the Midwest automated handpiece station and now Midwest E we plan to further develop Midwest into a global business. ","As we enter Q4 we will launch several new products. First TRUSHAPE, a new endodontic file system which is a shape adjusting file that preserves dentin and supports the emerging trend of minimal invasive dentistry. This is a new approach endodontics and as the market leader we believe we are well positioned to demonstrate its clinical effectiveness. ","Second, we\u2019ve launched a new guided surgery kit for the Astra Tech ED implant system. This is based off our market leading Simplant guided surgery system and will further support the launch of the Astra Tech ED System. Finally Miyabi, Miyabi high strength composite intended for the fabrication of anterior crowns. This is an additional indication for the potential in innovation in non-metal crown and bridge materials which is a key focus of our prosthetics business. Miyabi has been recently approved for the Japanese public market and is in launch with excellent acceptance.","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris Clark for the financial review. ","Christopher T. Clark ","I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our financial performance for the third quarter including our efforts to improve operating margin, cash flow, and asset utilization. As Bret mentioned, internal sales growth in the quarter accelerated from the levels we saw in Q2 both globally and in all three major geographic regions with the US growth particularly notable given the 4.3% growth in base line in last year\u2019s third quarter.","Our results included combined headwinds of about 75 basis points from a discontinued non-core non-dental product in the US that was insourced by a customer and also from ongoing headwinds from Russia CIS. Consistent with previous years, we implemented price increases across many of our businesses effective October 1st. We estimate the pricing impact to be generally similar to previous years, although in a lower interest rate environment we believe customers may have pulled forward a modest level of incremental purchases in advance of the pricing change. While it\u2019s difficult to quantify, we estimate this impact to have been approximately 40 to 50 basis points in sales growth in the quarter. ","Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 57.7% of sales excluding precious metals which represented an improvement of 110 basis points over last year\u2019s third quarter. The impact here is primarily price and mix effects in the period. SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.1% of sales excluding precious metals. This was 40 basis points above our run rate in Q3 2013 and reflects increased professional services spending in the quarter. ","Operating margin for the quarter improved 80 basis points to 18.7% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis and that compares to 17.9% in the third quarter last year. I would add that currency was a slight headwind to operating margin in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with our operating margin improvement as adjusted operating margin for the first nine months of 2014 is up by 80 basis points over prior year despite a 30 basis point headwind from currency over that period. ","We believe that we are solidly on track towards our objective of reaching a 20% adjusted operating margin rate in 2017 and believe our margin improvement strategies are gaining traction. Jim spoke to a number of the initiatives here so I won\u2019t repeat those but I do want to comment while progress towards the 20% goal will not be linear, we are very much on track against the objectives and we\u2019ll continue to provide perspective on key events and strategies as we move forward.","Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 21.8% and our operating tax rate was 22.8% for the quarter. As anticipated tax represented a bit of a headwind in the quarter as the operating tax rate was 70 basis points above our 22.1% rate in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date our operating tax rate of 22.6% is a 60 basis point headwind to last year\u2019s rate. That\u2019s consistent with the guidance that we provided for the year. I should also note that this is also consistent with what we expect for the operating tax rate in the fourth quarter which will be a negative comparison of last year\u2019s fourth quarter tax rate by about 180 basis points. ","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the third quarter was $75.3 million or $0.52 per diluted share and that compares to $79.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the third quarter 2013. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the press release. On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew to $89.3 million from $82.2 million in the prior year quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8.8% to $0.62 per diluted share compared to $0.57 per diluted share in the third quarter last year.","While we commented on the Q2 earnings call that then current rates would have minimal impact on earnings for the second half of the year, exchange rates moved against us as the quarter progressed with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro being particularly acute. As a result earnings in the third quarter were negatively impacted by currency by approximately $0.01 per share. While rates are highly volatile at present, we anticipated currency being a headwind in fourth quarter earnings by about $0.02 per share as we enter the quarter with a euro rate that was 7% weaker versus the US dollar compared to the prior year. ","Moving onto cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $147.5 million which represents a 17% increase over last year\u2019s $126.5 million. This represents a record third quarter cash flow performance for the company, as our third straight quarterly record. For the first nine months of 2013, our operating cash flow of $367.8 million represents an increase of $109.5 million over prior year which is a 42% increase. ","Our free cash flow yield has increased to well above 6% on a trailing 12 months basis. We continue to focus on driving better cash conversion and while we\u2019re pleased with the progress we continue to see opportunities to improve them even further moving forward as we continue to drive working capital improvements.","With respect to working capital, I had commented previously that after strategically increasing inventories for several quarters to support anticipated operational changes, we anticipated that inventories would start to decline in the second half of the year and then gradually return to more normal levels. We are executing to that plan as inventories dropped by four days sequentially in the quarter and now stand at 119 days on a constant currency basis compared to 123 days at the end of June and 118 days last September.","Account receivable days were 62 days at the end of September down two days from last year and up sequentially. Capital expenditures were $24 million in the quarter while depreciation was $21 million and amortization was $13 million. We anticipate cap ex to be approximately $110 million for the year and this reflects incremental investments in initiatives to support our 20% operating margin goal including continued investment in our common ERP platform initiative. ","Net debt improved by over $117 million in the quarter and our net debt to capitalization ratio now stands at 32.2% compared to 35.8% a year ago and 48.2% right after the Astra Tech acquisition. Given our rapid deleveraging of strong cash flow, we view capital deployment as a catalyst moving forward with focus on reinvestment in growth initiatives, acquisitions, and share repurchases. We remain highly engaged on the acquisition front and continue to see opportunities to strengthen the business through M&A. ","From a share repurchase standpoint, the company repurchased approximately 345,000 shares of common stock in the quarter and that brings our year-to-date total to approximately 1.5 million shares. Through September we\u2019ve returned almost $100 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and as I mentioned we continue to see capital deployment through both M&A and share repurchases as opportunities to accelerate value moving forward. ","As we look to the fourth quarter we\u2019re assuming generally similar market trends to what we\u2019ve experienced recently. We\u2019re also anticipating comparative headwinds of approximately $0.05 per share as a result of the currency impact I mentioned previously, a modest contraction in channel inventories as a result of purchases ahead of the October price increase, incremental investments to support our operating margin improvement initiatives, and also the continued year-on-year headwind in our operating tax rate that actually increases in the fourth quarter. Based on these factors, we\u2019re narrowing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.49 to $2.53 for the year. ","That completes our prepared remarks. We certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019d be glad to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","In terms of the organic revenue growth acceleration in the quarter, can you speak to the improvements on a sequential basis? What exactly changed to go from a modest decline in Q2 to up about 2.4% in the third quarter? Could you speak to any variability you saw month-to-month through the period and particularly how you exited the quarter, especially in the US.","Bret W. Wise ","The improvements we saw were pretty broad across the spectrum of both countries and products. Europe in particular was broad, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. If I had to point a finger at things that have improved from a product category basis, it would be the chairside consumables have been strong for us but continue to be particularly strong for us in the third quarter. We saw our performance in implants improve in the third quarter and again, on a regional basis we saw Europe improve pretty notably in the quarter so that\u2019s a couple items.","I\u2019d also say the things that were dragging our performance became less of a drag in the third quarter as well. As far as improvement throughout the quarter, I\u2019m going to tell you that September was by far the best but you know, the third quarter, particularly in Europe, is a one month quarter, September is basically all you get and in this September there was an extra selling day. We were short a selling day in August but we had an extra selling day in September so we would have expected it to be strong.","With respect to the US market, I don\u2019t know that I saw a huge variance throughout the quarter so I would say we exited the quarter at about a pace we saw throughout the quarter, not notably stronger or weaker. ","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Chris, I guess a two-part question for you, on the working capital front could you speak to what you perceive as the incremental near term opportunity on the inventory side? Should we expect those levels to decline on an absolute basis over the coming quarters? Secondly, without sort of getting into guidance for next year but just to give us a benchmark, at current rates can you quantify what the EPS headwind would be from currency in 2015 for us?","Christopher T. Clark ","Relative to working capital and specifically inventory, I mean, we commented previously that we had increased strategically inventories in advance of some operational changes and we anticipated in the second half of 2014 for that to begin to gradually come down and continue to come down in 2015. Again, as I commented, I think we\u2019re very much on that plan we came down four days sequentially in the third quarter. We\u2019re pleased with that. We would anticipate some continued progress in the fourth quarter.","Typically our fees in terms of inventory through the year typically have this increasing inventory slightly in the first half of the year and then bringing it down. But again, I think four days coming down in a quarter is pretty strong for us. As we look at it, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate Q4 continuing to come down a bit and as we look to next year I think we\u2019ll continue to come down. We may not come down quiet as sequentially or quite to that same degree or that same rate, but we\u2019re sitting at 119 days which gives us significant opportunity yet to bring this down to a far more reasonable number.","Regarding FX, I\u2019m not going to quantify what the FX headwind would be for next year but obviously, as we enter Q4 we see a pretty significant strengthening of the US dollar against a number of factors, a number of other currencies. I mean, against the euro we\u2019re basically \u2013 we came into the quarter about 7% stronger in terms of the dollar against the euro. That\u2019s pretty consistent among other major currencies. Obviously, we have a cash flow hedging program in place that helps to moderate that if you will or gradualize that but there\u2019s no doubt that in general a weaker dollar is certainly helpful to us relative to a stronger dollar. We\u2019ll provide more flavor on that if the rates stay where they are. In any case wherever the rates are we\u2019ll provide more flavor on that on the call in February.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Unidentified Analyst \u2013 Goldman Sachs. ","Unidentified Analyst \u2013 Goldman Sachs","If I could just ask on the performance you saw in implants in the quarter, definitely better than we\u2019ve seen for the last several quarters. I\u2019d just be curious to get your thoughts on how much of the improvement might have been tied to just stronger growth in the overall implant market versus what was maybe related to share gains that came with the launch of Astra Tech EV system.","James G. Mosch ","I would say that when we look at the overall implant market we believe that\u2019s growing at mid-single digit levels. We feel that we\u2019re in alignment with that. The performance in the various markets obviously, CIS continues to be a very significant drag. We saw improvement in Europe ex CIS probably at the best level we\u2019ve seen since the acquisition. We actually would like to think that that\u2019s a little bit better than market within Europe. As far as the rest of the geographies, I think we felt that we were pretty much in line with that. It could be a little bit stronger in North America.","Bret W. Wise ","I\u2019d add to that, the EV launch really took hold with full inventory in September for us in North America so we\u2019re just getting into that.","Unidentified Analyst \u2013 Goldman Sachs","If I could just shift gears to the efficiency initiatives that you\u2019re working on and the margin expansion that you\u2019ve seen. I\u2019d just be curious to get your thoughts on does that allow you to invest in your competitive positioning in the market and try to go after share more aggressively? Maybe overall, kind of your thoughts on investing some of these savings back into the business.","Bret W. Wise ","That\u2019s a great question and the program is designed to take cost out in certain elements of the business and reinvest a portion of those savings in variable spending for growth. So we are now and we will be, as we move through the next two years on the margin expansion program, redirecting some of the savings \u2013 and the margin target is a net target, it\u2019s net of the reinvestment. But we\u2019ll be reinvesting some of those savings in four or five areas that we think can facilitate stronger growth going forward. So, that is part of the program.","Operator","","Your next question comes from [Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.","[Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.","You mentioned implants a few times, how did the other specialties fair in ortho in the quarter?","Bret W. Wise ","I\u2019d say it\u2019s a mix bag. Endo quite well, you know, we\u2019ve got a full bag of innovation both that\u2019s been launched in endo and that\u2019s coming so we\u2019re quite optimistic about that business. Ortho, is a business that is under repair for us still and we\u2019ve commented on these calls before, and I think it\u2019s still true that that\u2019s an area where competition is just really fierce meaning there\u2019s a lot of discounting, a lot of packaged deals, people trying to load up customers, etc. Probably the most competitive area of dentistry right now and the one area that I would say is under price pressure. Those circumstances continue from what we commented on over the last couple of quarters.","","[Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.","How far along are you in the process of regaining some of those clients that you lost a few years back?","James G. Mosch ","We\u2019ve consistently worked over the last couple of quarters on regaining those customers. I think as Bret has described, it has been somewhat of a dog fight. We believe that we got the initial two-thirds back pretty quickly. Obviously, capacity has increased in the market. The price pressure is there, market indications may be that [K] starts are probably flat at best so it\u2019s a very challenging market environment. I think we are putting programs in place, we are making the investments in the field organization and we are actively working to regain those customers.","Bret W. Wise ","I might add that I think we commented earlier or previously that we\u2019re managing this business for customer count at this stage. So again, we\u2019re very, very focused on basically an account-by-account war or battle if you will and again, obviously competition is doing what they can to keep those accounts as well.","[Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.","One more if I could. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there\u2019d be some discontinued products over the next couple of quarters. Will we see an impact to the topline from those or will it be too small to notice?","Christopher T. Clark ","It depends on timing and in part this is subject to what we\u2019re doing to the lab business in Europe so that\u2019s subject to discussions with the Works Councils. To the extent it\u2019s significant we\u2019ll call it out for you. I don\u2019t expect it to be material to the company any way, probably some trimming around the edges but if any one period is notable then we\u2019ll comment on it for you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America.","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America","Can you just go over kind of what are the next immediate steps to your cost savings initiatives that you\u2019ve laid out? It sounds like you\u2019re progressing according to plan but has anything surprised you there and can you quantify how much were incremental costs associated with those initiatives that may have offset some of the profit margin improvement in the quarter as well as what\u2019s embedded in the guidance for the fourth quarter?","Bret W. Wise ","I\u2019m going to start by talking about the initiative itself, I\u2019m going to let Chris address the impact in the second and third quarters and the impact we expect in the fourth quarter. The program is pretty broad, it\u2019s designed to take advantage of the global footprint we have, become as efficient as we can and then direct resources out to growth areas in the business model. The areas that we\u2019ve commented on thus far are procurement initiative and that\u2019s well under way. That\u2019s an area actually that we\u2019re investing in right now. ","We\u2019ve talked about consolidation of certain business units, Jim mentioned those in his remarks. Those are important, we\u2019ve had a total of three manufacturing facilities be consolidated since we initiated the program. I don\u2019t want to get into forward-looking statements on the program at this point because in part where this program goes will be subject to things like discussions with the Works Council that we\u2019ve mentioned in Germany so far. ","But I think from a broad perspective it\u2019s based on and we\u2019ll see savings in both the gross margin line and the SG&A line and the reinvestment will probably be more in the SG&A line. Chris, do you anything to add?","Christopher T. Clark ","In terms of the external costs, if you will, incremental costs associated with the program you should think of it probably in the terms of half a penny headwind to the third quarter and probably closer to a full penny in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s embedded in the $0.05 collective headwind that I mentioned earlier. ","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America","Can you elaborate on that pull forward in the quarter that you mentioned that benefitted revenue and if that\u2019s something that carries forward into the next quarter or how we should think about that?","Christopher T. Clark ","This is an annual occurrence if you [inaudible] agree in the context of we go out and many of our businesses have annual prices increases October 1st. We telegraph those price increases to our distributor partners that basically allows them to make the necessary changes they need to in their systems relative to their pricing, their catalogs, etc. That also provides them an opportunity to look at the price increase and make some buying decisions on their part relative to what they want to pull in, in advance of that. ","In a lower interest rate environment \u2013 we took \u2013 our price increase overall was pretty similar to normal years but obviously, in a lower interest rate environment some dealers may have pulled in a little more year-on-year than they did last year. Again, I don\u2019t think this is that significant but it may be 40 to 50 basis points in terms of the overall internal growth number in the quarter and obviously, that would be a temporary impact that would then come out in the fourth quarter. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Most of my questions have been answered at this point but let me circle back to one implant question if I could and then maybe just one quick modeling question. On the implant side, a number obviously above what a lot of us were expecting. I was wondering if maybe you could give us some EV details by geography? You said it was more robustly launched in September, I think that\u2019s probably a US and maybe a German comment but where else could we see that launched here in the next six, to 12, to 18 months and any comments on when you might be able to get that into Japan?","Bret W. Wise ","Let me let Jim deal with the timing issues on that.","James G. Mosch ","From a standpoint of the launch, the majority of our launch impacts have occurred really in Europe and some of the larger geographies, Germany really started up in summer and then in the United States we\u2019ve been managing capacities on this launch. Conversion process has been very strong, as a result we started some of the larger markets fats. So quite frankly, we\u2019ve seen good growth really from the European markets and then the North American markets quite frankly are just getting started. So we expect to see favorable impacts from them over time. ","I would say the North American market is challenging. It\u2019s a large market, it\u2019s heavily referral base and as a result the conversion process can be a bit more demanding but we\u2019re seeing good uptake from that standpoint. As it relates to Japan, we\u2019re in the very \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve gone ahead with the registration process. We don\u2019t have a good timeframe on that right now. If I had an expectation I would expect more towards the end of next year at the earliest for Japan.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","On the North American comments, I think probably even Europe to a certain extent with EV, we\u2019ve heard in some of our conversations that there might be some channel abutment issues you\u2019re still kind of going through and obviously, I think some of the Atlantis specialty abutment business maybe facing a little bit of pressure in general over the last year. But generally speaking, have you been dealing with some channel inventory issues there? Is there reason to believe that over the next quarter or two if you\u2019re already growing back in line with market that we have a chance to see kind of some above market growth out of your implant business here over the next few quarters?","Bret W. Wise ","I think that\u2019s a little hard to predict right at this stage. I would say on our digital business, on our Atlantis businesses, it was in my prepared comments, we still see double digit growth globally in that business and we continue to integrate some other portfolios in that business such as our Essix products line. So we\u2019re seeing some good movement in that portfolio.","The abutment issue is probably stronger in the referral based markets because you have a situation where you have general practitioners and labs that obviously have liquidation of abutment inventories and as those recover we should see improved growth.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Then Chris just a couple of modeling questions here real quickly. We talked a little bit about that pull forward effect that\u2019ll impact fourth quarter a little bit, it doesn\u2019t sound like from Bret\u2019s comments that the product rationalization issues will create much of a headwind going forward or at least not a sizeable one. How do we think about then as that customer insourcing issue comes off, I was interested to hear your lab comments that maybe that business starting to bottom out. I think that\u2019s maybe a 50 to 100 basis points of drag here for the last couple of years so is there \u2013 as these new products launch and those issues come off, it seems like there\u2019s some tailwinds here going into \u201915, and I know you\u2019re not providing \u201915 guidance, but is it right to think of some of those things coming off as providing some incremental tailwinds into next year?","Christopher T. Clark ","Obviously, you [inaudible] we\u2019ll give some thoughts on \u201915 a little bit in more depth here on the next call but I think there\u2019s a number of pluses and minuses here. Jim spoke, I think, to the implant momentum and obviously any additional momentum there is certainly helpful. Relative to the non-dental product in the US that\u2019s being insourced that\u2019ll be a headwind here for a little bit yet but sequentially a little bit less for the next couple of quarters. Obviously, a big factor for us is Russia CIS in the context of basically how that looks.","That continues to be a headwind of about 140 basis points on the European number so from that angle any improvement there is certainly going to help us. You hit it in terms of new products. I mean, innovation drives our business, Jim hit several of those and obviously, as we have stronger innovation cycles, that certainly should help us as well. So again, I think there\u2019s a number of pluses and minuses with it but I think that overall we certainly are pleased with the little bit more momentum that we had in Q3.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel","Maybe just two or three questions, Christ the first one, the gross margins were really big and I know you called out good mix but you had that performance in light of no longer benefitting from sort of a build in inventory. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen gross margin expansion north of 100 bips since early 2012 so can you just maybe parse out for us in your opinion what level of the expansion is sustainable? Then when we look out at the 20% out margin goal, maybe going forward from here how do you see that mix between op ex leverage and further gross margin expansion?","Christopher T. Clark ","Let me answer the second part first and then we\u2019ll kind of come back to the quarter. As we look at the 20% operating margin goal, we see opportunities both on the SG&A side as well as on the gross profit side. Relative to the gross profit side specifically, capacity utilization and obviously the procurements leverage that we think we can get out by acting in a far more coordinating manner globally is certainly helpful to that gross profit line and obviously, we\u2019ve anticipated that gaining more momentum moving forward.","On the SG&A side obviously, as look to leverage our SG&A base more effectively across our businesses I think that certainly is most helpful there. So I think I would characterize the improvement to the 20% operating margin goal as really hitting both lines pretty materially. In terms of the quarter, on the gross profit rate we were up 110 basis points. We had the two largest impacts there were price and mix in that order. ","I think that certainly we also did have a bit of improvement in terms of underlying manufacturing costs. But again, we certainly focus on both price and mix on an ongoing basis. We\u2019re pleased with the result in the quarter and again, I don\u2019t know that I would say that I would anticipate 110 basis points every quarter in terms of gross profit rates but I also think these are strategies in place by our businesses in terms of being aggressive where they can be on price and also focusing on what they can do particularly through innovation to drive to higher margin products.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel","Bret, for you the efficiency that\u2019s been impressive and quite honestly a little bit quicker to materialize than we thought especially in light of still modest growth in the industry and I believe you even got a little bit of an FX headwind on the op margin so you\u2019re up or tracking towards probably 70 basis points here in \u201914. I think you initially said you expected the cadence to be somewhat consistent to the 20%. Is this something where as you sit here six months post putting some of the initiatives in place you feel very confident about getting 20% in \u201917 and if market growth returns you could even see going north of that?","Bret W. Wise ","I think the easy answer to that question is yes, we\u2019re very confident we can get to the 20% by 2017. I mean, it\u2019s ingrained in all of our planning, we\u2019ve got a number of initiatives underway to make sure we achieve that so I think you should view the confidence as high that we\u2019ll get there. As far as the phasing or the timing of that, thus far this year it looks a little bit linear. I don\u2019t think it will be linear throughout the three year period because some of it will be event driven. So there will be some periods where we get greater margin expansion, there may be some periods where we give a little bit of that back as we make reinvestments or for whatever reason.","We\u2019re pleased with where it has gone so far. It does look linear so far but it\u2019s unlikely to be linear going forward and I think the entire organization is fully engaged to make sure we make that 20% target in \u201917.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel","Last one, if I can just quickly get one additional one in there. Bret, I think this one is also for you, just on the implant side more than implant mix I\u2019d go more down the road of channel mix, you had [inaudible] and sort of getting a new implant out here recently approved in the US and then yesterday\u2019s announcement between Patterson and Straumann, it seems like some of your competitors are getting a little bit more aggressive in the US specific to the GP channel and maybe you could just give us your thoughts on how you see that evolving and will you change your selling effort specific to that channel in the incoming quarters or years?","Bret W. Wise ","Let me comment on the model that has existed in the US for some time which is a referral model, I think Jim mentioned that. Typically, in implants because one it\u2019s difficult, two there\u2019s a fair amount of risks including legal risk, by far it\u2019s the most litigated area of dentistry that we know of, and the consequences of an implant failure are of course much greater and much more obvious than almost anything else we do. We believe the current model has developed because there\u2019s a fair amount of expertise required in placing the implant, placing the screw but not as much expertise required in restoring the implant.","Jim mentioned, this makes product conversions a little bit harder in this market because you\u2019ve got to convert both the specialist and the general practitioner that is going to restore the implant. That model has worked pretty well. We\u2019ve seen failure rates well under control and that is a model that we continue to reinforce. You mentioned a couple of competitors, I don\u2019t want to talk specifically about what any one competitor is doing but we\u2019ve seen the models evolve over time, we\u2019ve seen different competitors try different strategies and frankly, we watch those closely to see if they\u2019re indicative of a market shift of any kind that we need to participate in or react to.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now like to introduce your host for today's conference, John Sweeney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John P. Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, Ashley. And good morning and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. I'll remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available on our website at dentsplysirona.com.","Our earnings call presentation and many of the numbers discussed on the call today will be non-GAAP financial measures and there are reconciliations provided in our press release and in our earnings deck. The earnings call will be a little longer than usual today, as Don and Nick would like the opportunity to tell you about the diagnostic they've completed on the business and details of the upcoming restructuring plan.","But before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results and we base those statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.","John P. Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, John, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. We have a lot to cover, and appreciate you taking time with us this evening. Before talking about the specific results, I wanted to offer some perspective. After spending nine months here, a few things are very apparent. The first is that the dental industry is a great place to be with positive underlying trends relating to demographics, technology and economics.","Further, I believe, that Dentsply Sirona is well-positioned to succeed with a strong global footprint, important brands that have a loyal following, a strong track record of innovation tracing back over 100 years and, most importantly, a dedicated, passionate workforce.","But it's equally clear that our current business performance and trajectory over the past three years is not where it needs to be. We are not living up to our potential to deliver for our customers, investors and our employees. Our results in this quarter further highlight the need to take decisive action to better position the company for long-term value creation.","As part of the call today, we will outline the results of an extensive diagnostic and offer a major restructuring plan that we've begun executing against. Key components of that plan will focus on how we deliver sustainable 3% to 4% revenue growth and an operating margin of 20% by 2020, with further improvements targeted through 2022.","We plan to simplify the organization and have developed an aggressive cost-cutting savings target of over $200 million today. Just as we are disappointed in and fully accountable for our results, as we go through the presentation today, you will see that we are optimistic about the future of the business and that we are committed to taking the necessary steps to deliver attractive financial performance going forward.","Let's begin with the summary review of the third quarter. As you can see on slide 7, our top line was down 6.5% on internal basis in the third quarter. The revenue decline was significantly impacted by planned changes in our dealer inventory stocking levels in our Technologies & Equipment segment; and a $20 million reduction in Consumable revenues, resulting from a startup challenge in the new central distribution hub in Europe.","Our lower top line and increased expenses drove an adjusted operating income margin of 13% and adjusted EPS of $0.38. Operating cash flow was $126 million in the third quarter, reflecting the strong underlying cash flow generating capabilities of Dentsply Sirona.","Before I go into more detail on our restructuring plan, I will now turn the call over to Nick Alexos, who will go into more details on our financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, Don. And for everybody's reference, we're on page 9 of the slides, the segment performance for Consumables. As you know, we report across two segments: Consumables and Technologies & Equipment. Our Consumables segment accounted for 47% of our revenue for the third quarter and represents a diverse portfolio of products that provide steady growth at stable margins.","However, in Q3, as Don mentioned, our Consumables segment had an internal revenue decline of 3%, as we had a $20 million revenue shortfall resulting from operational issues at our European distribution center in Venlo, the Netherlands. Venlo is our centralized European distribution site.","As a result of the move to Venlo during the last year, in Q3, we experienced startup shipping delays for some of our product lines. We've put systems and a team in place now to fix these particular issues, and have seen improvement back to levels required for hitting our fourth quarter shipment forecast. While this was unfortunate, the facility will provide us with the infrastructure to more efficiently serve our customers in the European market.","Excluding the Venlo impact, Consumables revenues actually achieved low-single digit growth. The lower shipment volumes for Venlo, however, which caused also an unfavorable mix shift on our product sales, were the principal driver of our Consumables segment margin decline by 370 basis points as compared to the 2017 third quarter.","If you now go to page 10, segment performance for Technologies & Equipment. This segment accounted for 53% of the revenue for the third quarter. As you all know, our T&E segment has a number of unique technologies and includes our implant and healthcare businesses.","Q3 revenues in this segment declined by 11.3% and were down 9.3% on internal basis. Here, we had planned for and previously discussed some of the significant revenue reductions during the third quarter due to the dealer inventory restocking (00:06:37) of our equipment.","We had $34 million of dealer destocking in the third quarter, as opposed to $35 million of dealer stroking increases in the prior-year quarter for a net reduction in year-over-year revenue growth of $69 million.","Excluding the year-over-year stocking and destocking, T&E would actually have posted commendable growth for the quarter. In partnership with our primary dealers, we had actually a very successful DS World in October, which evidences good retail demand for our full range of products.","We did also see positive traction in implants and in our healthcare business, Wellspect, which serves the hydrophilic catheter market. Healthcare showed strong performance, up mid-single digits. This is a business that continues to realize revenue and profitability growth.","Technologies & Equipment margins were down 1,330 basis points as compared to prior year. This is significant margin compression as a result of a variety of factors. The year-over-year changes in Technologies & Equipment revenue due to the destocking that I mentioned versus stocking the year before, reduced T&E margins by about 600 basis points through just lower absorption in our fixed cost structure.","Product mix and pricing in certain businesses in Technologies & Equipment further reduced margin by approximately 300 basis points. And we also had some investments in marketing and sales capabilities, which we've talked about previously, in order to drive the continued growth that we're seeing in retail demand. And this impacted margins by about 200 basis points.","If you now go to slide 11, we can speak to the regional revenue performance. Looking at our business performance on a regional basis, U.S. revenue declined 10% on an internal basis in the quarter mainly due, once again, to the inventory destocking in our CAD\/CAM and imaging business, which is principally in the U.S. Looking to the balance of 2018, we expect our revenues will continue to be lower versus prior year for the same reason.","Going to Europe, revenues declined 8.4% on an internal basis, primarily driven by the revenue shortfall we mentioned with regards to Venlo and some softness in the equipment markets in Central Europe. As we move into the fourth quarter, we're beginning to see signs of normalized growth in the European equipment market suggesting that the downturn was temporary. Rest of world revenues increased 1.5% on internal growth.","Now, why don't we go to slide 12 for our consolidated non-GAAP financial summary. Revenues on a consolidated basis, excluding precious metals, declined 7.7% in the third quarter and were down 6.5% on an internal basis.","Of the $77 million of year-over-year decline in revenues, as you reconcile back, $69 million was due to the differential in stocking versus destocking for CAD\/CAM and imaging; $20 million was due to the problems we encountered in shipping for our Consumables business at Venlo; FX reduced revenues year-over-year by $70 million; and then, acquisitions added $5 million; with the remainder of approximately $20 million driven by organic growth.","Gross profit was $512.1 million or 55.4%, down 360 basis points, as compared to the prior year. Net destocking in our T&E segment accounted for about 200 basis points of this gross margin decline. And then, other factors, including Venlo, mix in price, accounted for the remainder of the gross profit margin compression.","Total operating expenses, which includes R&D, were $391.8 million, up $12 million as compared to prior year or $18 million on a constant currency basis. While our operating expenses benefit from our cost savings program during the quarter, these savings were more than offset by increased marketing and selling expenses and expenses related to restructuring and the building out of our new organization, as well as additional R&D expenses ahead of IDS and the timing of certain other costs.","Adjusted non-GAAP margins consequently declined to 13%, down 812 basis points, as a result of the gross margin declines that we discussed and the increased SG&A expense.","With regard to the targeted $100 million cost savings initiative, we've already achieved year-to-date about $50 million of actual savings and expect to achieve another $20 million for the remainder of the year, with the balance flowing into our new restructuring program. On a net EPS basis for Q3 were $0.38, compared to $0.70 in the prior year.","Let's go to slide 13 on cash flows, which shows that cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter were $125.6 million, down 24%; and cash flows from operations, less capital expenditures, were $76.2 million versus CapEx of prior year. In 2018, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $200 million or slightly less.","One additional cash flow initiative we have is a detailed program to reduce internal inventory levels. At the end of the third quarter, we continued to hold inventory at higher levels than 2017 due to the elevated requirements in Venlo. And we are now targeting a reduction versus our Q1 level peak of $20 million versus the level that we had targeted previously of $30 million.","Lastly, in terms of guidance, page 14. On an income statement basis, at this point, based on our Q3 performance and our view of Q4, we continue to expect revenue of 2018 at $3.95 billion or a 2% constant currency decline over 2017. As we are seeing better retail demand for T&E products in key markets, our estimate for the dealer destocking for 2018 is now $110 million to $115 million, slightly above our previous guidance range of $100 million to $110 million, which we think is a quite healthy achievement for this year. To-date, we've incurred $69 million of destocking, which means we are planning approximately $40 million to $45 million of destocking in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our revised guidance.","As a result of the weaker performance expected or resulted in the Q3, we now are looking at an OI margin of 15% to 15.5% for the full-year 2018. Given the lower-than-expected level of performance, adjusted EPS is now at or slightly below the bottom end of our previous range of $2 to $2.15. The new guidance includes the impact of Venlo, as well as some of the noted Q3 SG&A variances and the higher anticipated level of inventory burn.","Our tax rate assumption for 2018 remains at 22%. I want to reiterate our disappointment in our results, and I would also highlight the clear necessity to undertake the actions of our planned restructuring which are long overdue. At the same time, I share my appreciation for all our employees' efforts in working to improve the financial and operating performance of Dentsply Sirona.","And with that, I turn the call back over to Don, who will give an overview of our restructuring plan.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. As I mentioned in the opening, over the last six months, we've conducted an extensive review of our business. This involves our board, leadership team, customers, partners and outside advisors. The conclusions have reaffirmed our thoughts on the positive long-term prospects for both the market and that of Dentsply Sirona. The analysis shows that the dental market is an attractive category with sales in excess of $25 billion. It is one that has consistently grown in the mid-single digits, with 2018 being no exception.","Growing economies, favorable demographics and new procedures will continue to fuel the market, more than offsetting some of the category consolidation and pricing pressure that has been seen over the last few years.","New innovations can drive growth and create entirely new platforms. As we've seen with CAD\/CAM, imaging, implants and clear aligners, technology can transform dentistry and improve patient outcomes while making the dentist more efficient. The technology also allows general dentist to develop capabilities to perform procedures that were historically done by specialist, expanding care options for patients and enhance revenue streams for the dentists. All of this underlines the growth potential of dentistry.","Our assessment also highlighted Dentsply Sirona's unique positioning within this market. We have a truly global footprint that allows the company to maximize the sale of our innovations. Our company has major brands that serve as anchors in many of the critical procedures. These brands are well-recognized and have a very loyal following, and will service platforms for us to expand from and to cross-sell solutions.","Our tracking study shows the company and many of our marquee brands have a well-deserved reputation for innovation and quality. We have an experienced and committed workforce of over 16,000 people today that carry on the legacy of serving customers for over 100 years. But reputation and legacy are no guarantee for future success, and our diagnostic has helped clarify critical areas where we need to improve. These areas include: inconsistent growth, margin compression, and organizational complexity.","Starting with growth on slide 17. Today, our analysis identified four major causes for our lack of consistent growth. The first is that our R&D program has not delivered a consistent level of substantial innovation needed to increase sales. The second is that we have not created scale with the customer. Our individual businesses have viewed the customers as unique and distinctive, resulting in multiple approaches to often the same customer. They would be Tulsa customer or a CEREC customer, not a Dentsply Sirona customer. This diminishes our impact, while increasing costs.","The third is the need to improve our sales and marketing execution. Our analysis shows it will be important to take greater responsibility for our own demand creation. The major change in the U.S. Technology & Equipment area over the last two years highlighted that we've historically relied heavily on partners to create demand for a number of our products. While we think that is a very important part of our sales and marketing model, they also highlight the need for Dentsply Sirona to do a much better job supporting our own products with demand creation activity.","The second area of improvement in sales and marketing execution is being more rigorous around decision-making and the measurement criteria. By bringing greater discipline and evaluating our sales and marketing programs, we will generate greater impact and improve returns on this investment.","Finally, given the breadth of our platform, we believe it is imperative that we move from a product orientation to a customer focus in order to deliver meaningful solutions. Our margin compression can be attributed to several factors. The first is that we have a high fixed cost structure. Whether on our manufacturing network or sales and marketing organizations, we have a high level of fixed costs mainly related to human capital. This does not allow us to react quickly to changes in the market. Our results in 2018 highlighted this as we faced significant dealer inventory reductions without the corresponding reduction in our cost structure.","The second factor has been an expansion in sales and marketing spending at both the country and the strategic business unit level in anticipation of growth that has not been generated. The final area is pricing compression in some categories, like imaging. This pricing compression is a function of shift to lower price parts of our lines, as well as promotional efforts designed to maintain competitiveness.","The diagnostic also highlighted an unnecessarily complex business model. With 10 dental strategic business units interfacing with over 50 individual countries and over 200 legal entities, our current business matrix creates challenge that is expensive to maintain and makes clear accountability and prioritization very difficult.","While various restructuring programs have started in the past, they've not been completed. The result has been a partial evolution of the organizational structure that now needs to be addressed. Based on the review of our business, we formulated a comprehensive program to enhance growth, improve margins and simplify the organization. We believe that this program will enable us to deliver 3% to 4% revenue growth, and operating margins of 20% by the end of 2020, and a return to pre-merger levels by 2022 with continuous improvements thereafter.","In order to deliver this improvement, five new operating principles are being incorporated into the company that will help us achieve our aspirations. These operating principles include, first, approaching our customers as one across the entire organization. By understanding all the ways that we have a relationship with that customer across the entire company, Dentsply Sirona will be better able to serve that customer.","Second, we recognize the need to take full responsibility for creating our own demand. As we launch new technologies that can transform procedures, we have a response ability to educate dentists and their staff on how to use them and why our products are unique. And while our dealers do a wonderful job, it is our role to bring KOLs, clinical education and unique sales and marketing programs to help successfully sell our solutions.","Third, innovation is our lifeblood and, going forward, we have to ensure that our innovation is substantial and supportive. We need to prioritize our R&D spending across the entire company portfolio, rather than looking at each of the individual business units that have been driving their own innovation plans.","Fourth, Dentsply Sirona is the leader in clinical education, but we must take that to a new level. As there is more and more technology and product innovation, we believe that we can play a unique role across procedures by providing best-in-class clinical education, whether it's through our state-of-the-art training facilities in places like Charlotte and Bensheim, or regional and local training events, or through our online presence. This will be a differentiator for us.","And, finally, we need to operate at scale. Our history of loose integration has not allowed us to get the operational efficiencies we need, whether in procurement, logistics, manufacturing, sales force or other marketing programs, we will look to create cross-company leverage going forward to take full advantage of our scale.","Under our plan to accelerate growth, there are four key programs. The first is a significant consolidation of our commercial organization, starting with the strategic business units. We will be moving from 10 dental SBUs to 4, while forcing them on strategic marketing and innovation.","Moving to a more focused approach here will allow for the creation of centers of excellence, elimination of duplication, and can allow the organization to better prioritize R&D and marketing programs.","As part of this consolidation responsibility for supply chain, we'll move from the SBUs to a newly created central supply chain organization. While we're keeping the current reporting segments, we will have five product groups. They're: healthcare, which will continue to stand alone; we will then look at digital dentistry, which is composed of CAD\/CAM and Orthodontics; next comes equipment and instruments, which will include treatment centers, instruments and imaging; implants will be stand-alone; and finally Consumables, composed of our restorative, preventive, endodontics and lab businesses.","In addition, we will be consolidating our regional commercial organization to focus on common country clusters. This strategy puts the customer at the center of how Dentsply Sirona is organized and, importantly, leverage sales and marketing infrastructure across multiple countries. This also serves to eliminate the duplication of resources at the corporate, regional and country level.","While we will continue investing in R&D, with spending in 2018 exceeding $160 million, going forward innovation will be prioritized across all the businesses to focus on the large initiatives that can generate the most benefit to the entire company.","As noted earlier, our current model relies on each SBU developing their own R&D priorities, and this has hampered the company's ability to capitalize on the largest opportunities and allocate resources accordingly. This approach will lead to bigger ideas that are delivered faster with more complete support.","One of our biggest assets is our sales force. In addition to maximizing our return to this critical area, we are making some important changes. To become more customer-centric, all countries will move to a single unified sales and marketing structure.","Today, resources in the countries are mixed between some commercial efforts run by the SBUs versus other run by the countries. Further, we've recently concluded a major segmentation study in the sales force effectiveness diagnostic in the U.S. The results will allow for a much more analytically driven approach to targeting and call planning.","This will be enhanced by a single view of the customer, a single CRM system, and a single sales operation platform. It will also facilitate cross-selling opportunities and more pricing discipline, and we will bring this process to the globe.","Our experience in places like Latin America and China have also shown the importance of the emerging markets. In these developing economies, we have seen high-single digit growth opportunities. Applying our model of focused support to other areas of the world will continue to be an important part of our growth strategy. All of these activities will contribute to restarting our growth engine.","I will now turn to margin improvement and organizational simplification. In addition to the structural changes mentioned before, we'll be looking at several other programs to improve our margins. A major initiative is moving to a centralized global supply chain.","Our supply chain has historically been run at the business unit or country level. This does not allow us to leverage critical areas for scale, including manufacturing, global demand planning, logistics, distribution or procurement; all areas that, given our size, should be a competitive advantage for Dentsply Sirona.","Moving to one supply chain will allow for scale, improved costs and more reliability. It's important to note though that this movement will happen over two years as we build the structure necessary to accept this organization and avoid supply chain disruption.","As part of our diagnostics, several opportunities to shape our portfolio have been identified. Going forward, our focus will be on looking to address businesses that are non-core, not profitable or underperforming. There will be a strong bias to action.","It should be noted that Wellspect is not one of these assets. This business has been performing well and is accretive to our growth and profitability. It also benefits from leverage in our share back-office areas. As such, this would be an area of continued investment for us.","Supporting both the growth and the margin improvement initiatives is our organizational simplification effort. In addition to the consolidation around the strategic business units, the regional commercial units and the centralized supply chain, we will be reorganizing our support functions to serve these units. Functional realignment will happen as the commercial units are made operational.","Slide 31 details our head count reduction goals. As a result of the streamlining initiatives and margin improvement programs, we are targeting a net head count reduction of 6% to 8% by 2021 from the current level of roughly 16,300 people today. This is a very difficult decision for the organization, and we will work with our employees and workers council to determine the best outcome for all of them.","On slide 22 (sic) [32], we outline our anticipated $20 million to $25 million cost reduction program. We fully expect to drive margins of 20% by the end of 2020 and return to pre-merger levels by 2022, with additional improvements thereafter. The restructuring will result in a onetime charge and expenses of up to $275 million.","On slide 33, we outline our multi-year expectations. In terms of revenue growth, we can see Consumables holding steady at 2% to 3%. We anticipate Technologies & Equipment returning to growth in 2019, partially as a result of getting through our 2018 inventory destocking, but also due to the generally improving U.S. retail trends. This segment should grow 4% or even more going forward.","Taken together, we believe this will result in Dentsply Sirona revenue growth at\/or above market, with our target of 3% to 4%. In terms of our operating income, our goal is to realize a margin of 22% by 2022. While 2019 will be a year focused on execution, we expect to see margins of 20% by the end of 2020.","This revenue and margin algorithm yield solid double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. This will translate into growth in operating and free cash flow, which we will then utilize to further enhance our financial performance. We understand that we need to reinforce our credibility by demonstrating that we are on track to achieve our goals.","On slide 34, we detail the key activities and associated metrics that will allow you to measure our success and our financial progress. Among the key activities we will report progress on, include the SBU and RCO consolidation, with our expectation that the majority of them will be completed in the first half of 2019.","A second key activity will be implementing a sales force effectiveness program, which we'll be starting in the U.S. and transferred around the world through the course of 2019. Another critical activity is progress in creating a comprehensive R&D portfolio program. We expect it to be completed in 2019, and we'll provide progress reports as appropriate.","And we will also provide an update on our portfolio shaping activities. Among critical non-financial metrics we will report on, include head count reduction, progress in critical growth markets, and the number of clinical education contacts that we have.","Financial measures will include revenue growth, operating income margin, as well as our progress on restructuring charges. This is an ambitious and comprehensive program, and there are obviously risks in pursuing a change initiative of this size. We've worked with our entire organization and outside advisors to make sure there are adequate resources to accomplish the plan.","A phase approach will allow us to focus on completing critical priorities before moving on. And above all, we have prioritized managing our customers and implementing a strong system of financial control to improve management visibility during this process.","So now to summarize. As you heard today, we are taking major steps to restructure our businesses to deliver on the promise of our portfolio. We've outlined a path that will lead to substantial value creation. We are focused on driving growth, improving margins and simplifying our business. We do recognize the scope of the undertaking and the task at hand.","Coming out of that business diagnostic, the board and management are convinced that this is the right plan. But we also acknowledge that the restructuring will take time. Our near-term priority's execution in 2019 will be a transition year, but you will see signs of progress. We're cognizant of risk mitigation to making sure that we do this in a way that does not disrupt our revenue stream, impact our customers or interrupt our supply chain.","You will see margins of 20% by 2020, with improvement to pre-merger levels thereafter; and we're not done. We're looking for more and are on a path to returning margins to pre-merger levels over the long run or higher. Our team looks forward to providing an update in 2019, including our progress against the KPIs and business initiatives that we've laid out for you today.","As this comes to a close, I wanted to relate that we just completed a two-day Leadership Summit with our top 50 leaders. I was very impressed by their passion for this company and commitment for delivering to our investors, customers and employees.","They're excited about this plan, and this excitement is critical as we put Dentsply Sirona on a more sustainable path. We look forward to updating you on our progress regularly. In light of the restructuring we announced today, we will not be holding an Investor Day in the fourth quarter. We believe it is critical that we are focused on executing and delivering sustainable value.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions. John?","John P. Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yes. Operator, we'd like to take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Quite a lot to digest there. I guess, Don, with respect to your 3% to 4% sort of top line growth outlook for the next few years, can you sort of speak to how you expect to achieve that, given the number of moves you're making internally and the potential risks from disruption, as we've seen with the distribution center facility transition this quarter?","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's a great question. Thanks, Brandon, and thanks for spending time with us today. Look, right now, as we've gone through this change initiative, we've established two core priorities that we refer to as guardrails. The first is, we can't interrupt our customer service and we've got to make sure our supply chain is reliable.","So if you listen to the presentation, we kind of talk about the fact that we will make the supply chain changes gradually. And one of the things we're learning with things like Venlo is, we've got to make sure our processes are in great shape before we transfer. So we're saying that supply chain will be a little bit more of a gradual kind of over the next 18 months, 2-year program to make sure that we have adequate supply of product that needs to support our selling initiatives.","In terms of \u2013 on the commercial side, it's really interesting. I've been here nine months and I've been really impressed with our ability to generate sales in a lot of different places. But I do find it somewhat difficult to say, at a local country level, what our priorities are. So in our mind, by looking to move to four SBUs \u2013 four dental groups, if you will \u2013 and really focusing the R&D on bigger and more substantial innovation, we really think that we are going to actually simplify the execution at the country level, which we think will have a positive impact even though there's going to be some change in the back.","The other issue is, we've been really working hard to make sure that our sales force effectiveness program, which we're starting to implement in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019, is really gradual. I mean the thing you don't want to do is literally have 2,000 sales and marketing people waking up the following morning and doing something different.","So we're really looking on focusing on maintaining each of the salespeople relationship with their critical customers and really helping them do a better job in understanding all the other areas that that customer is touched by Dentsply Sirona and look at cross-selling it and other solution things.","So, yeah, look, we understand it's a big program. We have spent a lot of time with our leadership group to make sure that we outline clear priorities of, don't interrupt your revenue stream, make sure that you've got an adequate supply of products, and let's really get the commercial organization where it needs to get to quickly, and then let's focus on really making our sales force hum in the field.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. And I guess one more...","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Go ahead, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","...if I could, just on the head count reduction. Could you just elaborate on what areas of the business that will come out of, whether it's sales, R&D? Thank you.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Brandon. Look, we understand we gave you guys a ton of stuff tonight and we're going to relax our one-question policy. So, look, as we go forward, I would tell you the strategic business unit and the regional commercial organization consolidation, it's obviously a big chunk of what we have in the plan right now, and that will happen most immediately.","But as you begin to look at other areas, where we think that there's significant opportunity is around supply chain, around some of the functional areas, that need to begin to reflect the new organizational structure. We think there'll be considerable savings as we go through that. And a lot of this, Brandon, is really eliminating duplication. If we have a strategic business unit that is in charge of, say, Western Europe; and then the countries in Western Europe have similar people doing marketing of, say, implants, we really want to eliminate some of that duplication.","And then, over time, we also really have done a pretty extensive portfolio shaping analysis. And as we go through that, we think that there are some opportunities to really focus on units that may be not strategic, not really in our core, or really been underperforming for a number of years that we think we can move on, and that's going to have an impact on heads (00:37:22).","So I would tell you, look, the SBU and RCO consolidation, followed by supply chain, are obviously areas of portfolio shaping. And, ultimately, we really don't think that it's going to be a big change in our sales force. We just like to make our current sales force more effective.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Guys, can you hear me okay?","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Great. Hey, Don, how are you? So I guess my first question, and I'll make it two very quick questions. But just kind of that path to 3% to 4% revenue and the path to 20%, it sounds like exiting 2020, if I'm hearing you right on that. But I would assume that's going to be choppy. You've laid out a little bit on 2019, but I would assume we shouldn't connect kind of dots as they're more of a ramp at the end of it or kind of an acceleration in some of those improvements as we get deeper into these efforts.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","First, Jeff, thanks for the question. And they don't even have to be quick. Look, we're not going to give you kind of a quarter-by-quarter margin expectation. I do think that we're timing some of the commercial changes relatively quickly. And, look, the portfolio shaping, which are relatively minor businesses, will occur over the time period that we're outlining.","I do think that, if you saw the press release, that we do say as \u2013 one of the ways we're really looking to make sure that we're showing performance quickly is we're committing to our operating expenses being lower in 2019 than they were in 2018. And that's kind of a way that we're really holding ourselves accountable for not only head count changes, but really getting after cost.","And, Jeff, one thing I really want to emphasize and it's one of the challenges when we're trying to communicate a program this significant is, obviously, the hard numbers are sitting there in the costs and the head count. And I've referenced the top 50 meeting. Our leadership team fundamentally believes that really focusing the organization on bigger priorities and bigger bets and more substantial innovation is actually going to liberate the organization and really help it grow.","So one of the things when we talk about this program internally is really focus on, A, delivering the margin improvement that we have to deliver. But, boy, we get excited about the opportunity to really get after growth.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. And then, yeah, I guess let me just follow up, Don, on the question or on the point you made there on operating expenses coming down next year. Where do you think gross margins go next year and over the next couple years? Obviously, you talked about some price mix issues in imaging this quarter? We've written some notes, I'm sure others have, on kind of some of those pressures maybe continuing for a while. And some other cost pressures on the manufacturing side, you might have it on the product mix side. So just where do you think gross margin really move here in the next one to two to three years?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Hey, Jeff. It's Nick. Let me take that. Thanks for the question. As you know and as Don has mentioned, we've got a high fixed cost structure. So as we look at the performance that we've targeted in the strategic plan, I think you're going to see both gross margins and then consequently operating margins improve as we better control our operating expenses.","So I don't have any specific gross margin target for you. But if you kind of pencil out where we're going to end up for the year given our guidance of 15% to 15.5% and then the 20% and 22% target, I think you're going to see a good portion of that \u2013 I guess an even split between gross margin and operating margin. And, certainly, the savings that we've targeted fall into both buckets.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. I'm going to try to (00:41:24) you guys out a little bit for 2019 as well. Just given that your long-term guidance is 3% to 4% in the top line, Street has you just under 3% top line next year. As we think about portfolio transformation, are you comfortable with where the Street is? And is it going to be a product-heavy year, given that it's an IDS year or should we think about the following IDS cycles being maybe more important for you guys?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Hey, Tycho. It's Nick. I would say that we are definitely expecting a good IDS year, and I'll let Don follow up on that. We're in the midst of our budget process, so we don't have a specific view on 2019. But as you know, with a dealer destocking of $110 million to $115 million this year, certainly, we would expect an uplift from that. And that will certainly help our absorption levels in our fixed cost facility. And that we're also targeting OpEx being below. We should have a good year next year while we're still ramping up our top line growth rate strategies.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. And, Tycho, just \u2013 obviously, you've tracked the category for a long period of time. IDS years tend to be significant years. The strategy we're taking right now is we're focusing on probably five to six big ideas and we're really going to drive them, which is a little bit of a different tack than we've taken in the past, where it might have been 30 or 40 things where we try to be all things to all people.","We're very comfortable that the innovations we are bringing and announcing at IDS are going to be significant. And, look, we're not going to outline exactly what they are. Obviously, we're in markets where you can tank markets in advance if you get too specific on what you're launching. But we are very comfortable that we're going to have a really strong IDS.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, a follow-up on equipment. The CAD\/CAM numbers out of Schein were great, up 40%. You obviously had the destock headwind. Can you maybe just talk the momentum in the underlying market around CAD\/CAM? And Jeff alluded to the pricing in his question. So can you maybe just talk on some of the strategies you've taken around pricing for CAD\/CAM?","And then, lastly, if I look at your comments a year ago, you've called out I think about an $8 million inventory destock headwind. Today, you're saying it was $34 million in the year-ago. So was that just the restatement that's the difference?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","No. I think last year's destocking for Q3 was the $34 million. Why don't we check on that Tycho? And, Don, can you answer on the pricing for CAD\/CAM and\/or imaging?","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. And, Tycho, if you go back to our second quarter call, we said that we were unhappy with the performance of our Technology & Equipment business, and we took a couple very specific actions; and I'll come back to where pricing fits in that. The first is, we stood up at sales force that was focused on CAD\/CAM. The second is, we launched a pretty comprehensive marketing program designed to create interest in not just CAD\/CAM, but imaging as well.","The, third, we worked with our dealer partners, and they've been terrific and getting their sales forces aligned, giving their sales forces the right level of incentives. We also offered some financing and we're seeing some very positive trends underlying. And Nick mentioned in his script that \u2013 he was talking about a very positive DS World, and we had a very good DS World. So I would tell you \u2013 and it hasn't been about price. It is realistically getting back and fundamentally delivering the benefits of chairside dentistry, which we think is transformative.","I think longer-term one of the questions that we have to look at is, what is the impact of DI and CAD\/CAM. And the interesting thing is that right now we're finding that CAD\/CAM is moving and we are seeing positive momentum there. And I don't think that's coming at the expense of DI. I think, there, some of the customers are beginning to segment themselves to say, look, I want to do DI and some of them want to do full chairside.","So, again, I think some of this is getting back to good old-fashioned blocking and tackling around CAD\/CAM. And again, it was my first DS World. And listening to the loyalty that CEREC doctors have for this product is really impressive.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks and good afternoon. I'm actually going to apologize in advance for this question, but I really think it's important. You guys are about 30% below the EPS range for 2018 that you gave only nine months ago; and numbers have essentially come down for each of the past three quarters. You're giving today numbers and goals that are two and four years out. And I guess what I'm asking is, why should people have conviction in those numbers?","And I am asking because if you look at the numbers, I think it implies to well over $3 in earnings power in 2022, which is really compelling. But how do you get people comfortable on the road map to achieve that? And then, I've got a shorter follow-up.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure. And, Jonathan, look it's a question we fully expect. And, look, I would tell you nobody is more disappointed in the movement that we've been doing with guidance than Nick and myself. So that's the first thing.","The second is why should people believe us? Well, if you listen to how we're kind of laying out our KPIs. We are laying out three, kind of, things for you to measure things along. And the first is what we kind of call activities. And we fully expect to provide transparency on these major initiatives. Where are they? Did we deliver on our R&D portfolio? Did we deliver on the sales force effectiveness program and where are we?","The second part of that is, we're really talking about non-financial metrics as we kind of go forward. And the last issue is, we're saying that we're going to report out on seven key financials, which are margin and all that stuff along the way.","In terms of what we're trying to get done? Look, on the underlying part of the business, the first thing starts with growth. And right now, if you basically peel back our third and fourth quarter, one is an issue that we didn't comprehend when we put together our budget in 2018, which was a major change in the dealer destocking of $110 million. That was pretty significant.","The second was, as we began to stand up a centralized facility in Europe, we had startup issues at the end of the quarter. We feel that that's been resolved and that site is moving along nicely. So as you look at what has impacted our 2018, they've been very significant headwinds.","If you look at going forward, we're trying to outline some very transparent steps around organizational structure, growth initiatives that we should be able to report on and give you mileposts along the way. But you're only as good as your \u2013 as we deliver. So without trying to quote Bill Parcells, we understand that we have to deliver on these commitments.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That was very helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just a shorter follow-up is, something that's certainly still the case, but might be temporary loss of investors as you've got a really under-levered balance sheet and good cash flow. But how do we think about deploying capital during this time of restructuring? Is management going to be overly focused on what you guys need to do over the next two to three years? Or can we still think about you guys executing on some tuck-ins along the way? Thanks for your time.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jon. And I would say it's the latter. Look, we believe that our go-to-market capabilities are really strong. And, look, we have a lot of areas that we think tuck-ins can really help us with the technology that we haven't developed internally or help us with a solution.","So, look, I'm not going to give an exact number of where we expect to deploy cash in terms of make it available for tuck-ins versus other uses. But we are going to be actively in the market, where we can see technologies that would help us accelerate growth. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So how is innovation a part of these new efforts to reinvigorate growth? And you mentioned the stepped-up innovation this year and an IDS year, but can you elaborate a little bit more on the pipeline? Do you have some more meaningful launches coming up even at Greater New York? Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","We're not going to do anything at Greater New York, Erin. Really the next big tranche of things will be IDS. And again, it's new to me, to be honest, because coming out of medical devices you could usually talk about the next couple years. But, obviously, in our Technology & Equipment business we have a consumer that pays attention to what we say. And if we announce specific innovations, we have a potential to change our buying trajectory before them. So we're not going to do that.","But most people tend to focus on our Technology & Equipment business. We feel pretty good that we've got some good innovations coming along in OraMetrix and our orthodontia business. We like what's going on in some of our implant businesses. In addition to straight up innovation that's coming out of our own shop, when you look at buying technologies that we don't believe we fully deployed, like, things like MIS, we get excited.","We think that there is some real work that we can be doing in our resto business and our Preventive franchises as well. And then, the last issue near and dear to our hearts is endo. And if we look at our track record of innovation over the last decade, it's been pretty important for us to innovate in endo. And right now, I would tell you that's a very high priority for us. So, Erin, we're looking forward to again a very, very fulsome IDS.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And how would you characterize U.S. Consumables growth parsing out specialty, as well as general Consumables? And I guess I'm focused here on the U.S., and (00:51:40) that you have visibility on the end market demand trends? Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. And while we don't give specific guidance on Consumables in the U.S., I mean, we feel the underlying U.S. business has been pretty good. Again, without quoting direct numbers, we feel our Consumables business is very competitive in the U.S. business. And again, we think that that marketplace has been growing in the mid-single digits, mid to low-single digit numbers. And again, we feel pretty good about how we're performing in that market, in that area.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the questions. Don, could you maybe help us think about the major buckets of the $200 million to $225 million of cost savings between head count and some of the other areas. Just think it would help getting that additional visibility as you think about the achievability of those targets?","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure. Actually, I'll turn it over to Nick.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I would say that the major buckets are obviously some level of head count reductions. Also, there is some rationalization of facilities and program management within that. I would say that they are half between kind of gross margin level expenses and then operating expenses across it. But as Don said earlier, we are looking to rationalize the organizational structure and eliminate some redundancies within the business by having fewer business units within the two segments, and that will increase efficiencies.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. And just to amplify what Nick said, Nathan, is, look, we believe that there is a significant opportunity in terms of the RCO SBU consolidation, some other functional consolidation. So put that in the head count bucket, the second area that we're excited about is procurement. Again, it's kind of hard to develop the really effective procurement organization when you've got SBUs in countries as the primary management point. So we think there's significant money there.","And then, in some of the portfolio shaping opportunities, we believe that there are businesses that are non-core and not particularly productive. So I would bucket it head count operational savings. And then, obviously, we're going to get a fair amount of margin lift in the accelerating growth portfolio or so.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then, just one on the disruption in Europe on the Consumables side. It looks like it was slightly more than 400 basis points of a headwind this quarter. Can you maybe just talk about the remediation efforts you put in place? And how quickly you think you can kind of get back to that more normalized growth?","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. And just for perspective, Venlo is something that we think is important for our ability to serve our customers long-term and it's a centralized activity. If you think about that particular facility, it services some of our direct \u2013 kind of smaller direct-to-doctor businesses; and that went fine as we were transferring a lot of the work we do with our dealers, which tend to be larger orders. Moving in, it was a new technology and new process in place for Venlo.","At this point, we feel pretty good that the Venlo situation is under control. We feel very good that the facility at this point is producing at a level that it should be able to meet any demand that we see currently forecasted in the fourth quarter. And then, Nick and I are actually going to be in Venlo next Tuesday to see for ourselves. But at this point, we feel pretty good that the situation has been remediated.","The other thing that it's going to be a learning opportunity for the organization, where, okay, how do we \u2013 what are the five key things we learn when we're doing these things. And I think it was an important trial-by-fire that I think will make us better as we really begin to look at doing some other supply chain consolidation.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon, Don and Nick. Thanks for taking the question. So couple of things to think about here. I guess I'm framing this a little bit differently. The legacy Dentsply company went through a very similar deep dive analysis about five years ago with the strategy to do some major restructuring cost savings that would also lead to a lot of margin expansion. And the company actually did achieve some of that and actually most of that margin expansion from, call it, 2013 to 2015 or 2016 or so.","But I guess the question really is that, given that Dentsply restructuring wasn't that long ago, first, is more of this restructuring related to legacy Sirona assets versus legacy Dentsply assets, although it doesn't really seem like it based on the slides? But then, number two, I guess is there still a lot of low-hanging fruit on the legacy Dentsply side of the business given that again this broad restructuring took place not that long ago? And do you run the risk of too much cutting just leading to, let's call it, unintended consequences on top line growth? Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Steve, and great question. It's interesting, one of the things coming in new, I get to read about all the projects, and the legacy Dentsply organization went through a relatively significant restructuring designed to do a much better job of integrating what at that time was six SBUs.","I would say it was reasonably successful, but was about halfway through about the time of the merger. And as such, some of the rationalization work that was targeted and planned on the legacy Dentsply side wasn't gotten to. And then, all of a sudden, you basically had a company the size of the legacy Dentsply organization on top of the organization that hadn't necessarily completed the transition it needed to do. So I tend to think that there \u2013 if the legacy Dentsply company had another 18, 24 months, I think that they would've delivered continued benefit there and it's benefit we're looking to get after now. That's the first point.","The second thing is, we've really stopped thinking about the company as kind of legacy Dentsply and legacy Sirona. And it's really interesting, one of the things that we need to start thinking about is you look at some of our specialty businesses, our Technology & Equipment businesses, there's cost leverages because we're calling on the same dentist with 10 different platforms.","And so, in my mind, it's less about how are we going to carve out savings on one side or the other. But let's take a customer approach and then let's look at what's the best way for us to understand the best relationship we have with that dentist and make sure that we're approaching it that way.","So in my mind, one of the opportunities of putting the companies together was to create a much broader portfolio that should be of a high degree of relevance to that dentist and deliver it that way and we just haven't done that. And then, as you think about the cost savings and the reason we say 20% by 2020 and then we say, look, we want to get back to premerger levels and beyond is that we think that there's a significant amount of supply chain work that we can do. We just don't want to do that right out of the gate as we're going through kind of a commercial evolution.","So that's kind of how we think about it. A long-winded way of saying Dentsply did not get all the low-hanging fruit and that the combination of these two assets, put together, should create other opportunities for us to get after.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's definitely some helpful color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, hi, and thanks for the time here. I want to try to help everybody get maybe a little bit more comfortable with the top line trajectory, maybe come at it a couple different ways. But, first, when I think about the challenges that the company has faced historically, they're actually pretty different in different regions. We tend to focus a lot on what's going on in the U.S. But I wonder if you could talk about the balance of improvement that you're contemplating in the top line trajectory and the extent to which they're different in the different regions, and the extent to which you think in the different regions, given their different market dynamics, the critical success factors might be more in your control?","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, Steve. Let's take things one at a time. I mean, first, we've been relatively consistent over the last nine months talking about the fact that we think developing market should be a good place for us, and we're going to continue investing in them. I mean, if you look at the growth we've been seeing in places like Brazil and China and the model we approach there, so we think that that's a model that we can continue investing in and replicate.","In terms of the different trajectories in the different parts of the world, look, there are lots of different trajectories. But I would tell you, in my mind, there's been two things that are consistent across all the regions and the first is, we've got to deliver major innovation. And whether it's major innovation in our Technology & Equipment business that's going to be relevant in Europe, that is going to be relevant in the U.S.; or whether it's coming up with new innovation and what we've considered like a specialty business like implants or in endo or something like orthodontia. We don't see a huge difference in the impact that those new products could have across the board.","So in our mind, there is not a regional strategy on, okay, do we need to develop a tailored North American strategy versus a Central Europe versus like emerging market. In our mind is how do we really look at innovation that's truly relevant across the market around the world. So I realize it might not sync completely up with your thesis there. But in my mind, if we can really get the new products and the pipeline flowing, point one; point two is make sure that we're consistently excellent in our go-to-market strategy, I think we're going to be in good shape.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, just building on the commentary about new products, how much do you think you can improve price and mix trends over the course of the forecast horizon with new product flow? Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Whether we improve it or arrest the decline, it's \u2013 I'll take those as two sides of the same coin. Look, the innovations that we're pushing out, we think have the potential to do very, very well in the marketplace. And we're very conscious of whether they're going to be margin accretive or dilutive. And one of the reasons that I cited the fact that we need to change our approach to R&D and begin to focus on bigger bets is, look, we need to look across our portfolio and say what's going to have the best benefit to our top and bottom line at Dentsply Sirona as to what might be the best for our Preventive SBU.","And in doing that, obviously, if there are higher-margin products that are more relevant in areas of the world that we have higher-margin profiles, that's where we're going to be able to pick up resources and reallocate them to deliver there. So again, I get very excited about some of the things in our pipeline and the fact that we do think that they are going to really help us on both the top line and margin basis.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Don, can you maybe go back to the strategic review you guys did of the market overall, dental market? What did you conclude for longer-term dental market growth? And what did that study conclude in terms of how the market's evolving, just to give us a sense of what Dentsply needs to do to sort of be able to outpace the market long term? Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, John. I would tell you, we break it up in kind of Consumables and Technology & Equipment. We think that there are positives in the Consumables business that are offsetting some of what you may think about consolidation, whether it's in the DSO's or some of the pricing compression. So we believe that the Consumables business is kind of a 2% to 4% relatively consistent. And again, there is positives in new products and other things that will offset what we consider, like consolidating related pressure.","On the T&E business, again, we really look at this year, and the largest market, there was a significant anomaly at the wholesale level, where we saw tremendous amount of inventory destocking. Again, I hope you hear that we were pretty happy with how the third quarter T&E business was performing. And we think that's indicative of we've got a good portfolio of products in T&E, whether that's CAD\/CAM or whether that's being more competitive in DI or instruments or other areas.","We believe that business should be a 4% to 6% or potentially higher grower depending on where we are in new product. So on an aggregate basis, we really look at the combined business sitting around 3% to 5%. And we said, both in our transcript and I believe in the press release, that we believe we ought to be able to track that market, if not outpace it. It's clearly our objective to outpace it.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And maybe a follow-up, Nick, for you. What is your thinking about destocking at this point? Are we done? As you think to 2019 and beyond, is the inventory in the channel appropriate? Or do we need to be thinking about more of that in 2019?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. The short answer, John, is that our expectation is that this will be a good year to get the level of inventory in the channel to where demand at a retail level corresponds with demand at the wholesale level. So it's obviously a significant reduction this year. $110 million to $115 million, and that's been trending pretty well. So we feel pretty good about getting this behind us.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yi Chen with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.","Yi Chen - H.C. Wainwright & Co.","Hi, sorry for that. Thank you for taking the question. So my question essentially relates to the revenue growth. What do you see in revenue growth essentially reversing?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, Yi, the answer to that \u2013 I mean obviously, as we said, the dealer destocking will help us certainly with revenue growth going into next year on the Technologies & Equipment side. And on the Consumables side, we believe the Venlo issue as certainly getting behind us and we'll be able to see a positive growth on the Consumables side as well. So, clearly, the expectation is positive revenue growth into next year.","Yi Chen - H.C. Wainwright & Co.","Perfect. Thank you so much for that.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Don for any closing remarks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay. Well, first, we appreciate that we went a little bit long today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Mr. John Sweeney Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","John Sweeney","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I'll remind you that the earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. Our earnings call presentation and many of the numbers discussed today will be non-GAAP financial measures and there are reconciliations provided in our press release and in our earnings deck.","But before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results and we base those statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q list some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer, Dentsply Sirona.","Donald Casey","Thanks, John, and thank you for joining us on our earnings call. We're going to cover two areas today. The first is the performance for the recently completed quarter, the second area is to provide an update on how we are executing against the restructuring plan we provided in November. As we will discuss, our performance for the quarter was solid. We're also pleased to report an important progress made in delivering against the plans we laid out. The organization continued to work aggressively to delivery for our customers, partners, employees and our shareholders.","Let's start with a brief review of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see on slide 6, internal growth was 3.9%. This was driven by a faster-than-anticipated ramp up in production of PrimeScan. This acceleration allowed for stronger-than-anticipated sales for the quarter and led to robust Technology & Equipment sales in the U. S. and Rest of World. In the first quarter, we had to an adjusted operating income margin of 15.6%, up 110 basis points as compared to prior year. And this in turn drove a first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.49, up 9% as compared to the prior year. Operating cash flow was $29.3 million, lower than last year, mainly due to restructuring and legal settlement charges and the timing of cash flows.","I will now hand it over to Nick, who will review of our financials and outlook for the remainder of the year.","Nick Alexos","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. We reported across two segments, Consumables and Technology & Equipment. As we previously told you, in the first quarter of 2019, we changed our two reporting segments to align with how the newly structured organization works. Orthodontics and Instruments moved from the Consumables segment into the Technology & Equipment segment and lab move from the Technology & Equipment segment into the Consumables segment. The segment information we are reporting today reflects the revised structure for all the periods shown.","Looking at slide 8, our Consumables segment accounted for 45% of our revenue for the first quarter and represents a diverse portfolio of products that provide steady growth and stable margins. In the first quarter, consumable revenues ex-precious metals were $414 million, down 4.9% as compared to the prior year and down 0.6% on an internal growth basis.","Consumable revenue growth was impacted by one less selling day in the first quarter of 2019 causing a 1.5% drag on growth rate. We saw strong consumer growth in Q4 of 2018, so the relative lower growth in the first quarter may reflect some normal quarterly variation.","Consumable margins declined 80 basis points as compared to the prior year to 25.5%. The reduction in the Consumable operating income margin was due to higher supply chain costs versus prior year.","On slide 9 we highlight our Technology & Equipment segment which accounted for 55% of revenue in the first quarter. Our T&E segment has unique digital capabilities that are proven transformational in dentistry. This segment also includes our Wellspect HealthCare business.","First quarter T& E revenues were $521 million, up 2.1% versus prior year and up a healthy 7.9% on an internal growth basis. All of our T&E product categories, equipment and instruments, digital, implants, and health care showed positive year-over-year growth during the quarter.","Our strongest growth came from our digital products which benefited from a successful launch of our planned scanned CAD\/CAM digital impression scanning system. In addition, our revenue growth rate reflects $8 million of equipment destocking in the prior year quarter. I am particularly pleased with our Wellspect business which saw growth in high single-digits and implants which turned in a positive performance.","Technology & Equipment operating income margins were 13.8%, up 40 basis points as compared to 13.4% in the prior year quarter, driven by higher volume and our portfolio shaping initiatives.","On Slide 10, we look at our business performance on a regional basis. U.S. revenues were $312 million, up 7.4% compared to prior year and up 6.4% on an internal sales growth basis. We experienced double-digit growth in our Technology & Equipment segment driven by strong CAD\/CAM sales and the impact of prior year dealer inventory destocking and positive growth in each of the T&E product categories.","Consumables sales were down slightly, partially driven by one less selling day. European revenues were $387 million, down 7.3% compared to the prior year and roughly flat on an internal growth basis. Two factors impacted European revenues; dentist held off purchasing dental equipment in advance of the International Dental Show in March; and stronger fourth quarter 2018 consumables sales may have impacted our first quarter 2019 performance.","Rest of world revenues were $236 million, down 0.7% compared to the prior year, but up 8.1% on an internal basis. This solid revenue growth was driven by our investments in expanding our footprint in these faster growing international markets. Rest of world also benefited from mid-single-digit growth in our Consumable category.","We have our consolidated non-GAAP P&L on slide 11. Revenues excluding precious metals were $935 million, down 1.1%, but up 3.9% on an internal growth basis. Total company revenue growth was driven by strong sales of technology and equipment.","Gross profit was $540 million, or 57. 8%, down 20 basis points as compared to the prior year. It should be noted that, on the sequential basis, gross margin improved 340 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. This was driven by more favorable mix, net pricing and our portfolio shaping strategy.","Total operating expenses were $394.6 million or down 3.9% as compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange drove the decline in SG&A, but even excluding exchange rate fluctuations, operating expense would have been roughly flat year-over-year. This represents a significant turnaround in operating expense trends, particularly since our first quarter 2019 OpEx, included $8 million of spending related to the IDS Dental Show in Germany.","The SG&A improvement was principally due to our restructuring, lower headcount and our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. OpEx, as a percentage of sales, was 42.2% in the first quarter of 2019, which was down 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 15.6%, up 110 basis points over prior year, driven mainly by the SG&A improvement. The tax rate for the quarter was 24%, up as compared to our prior previous guidance.","The increase in tax rate was due to increased percentage of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions. First quarter EPS was $0.49, up 9% compared to the $0.45 in the prior year quarter. Slide 12 shows the cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was $29.3 million, down 47% versus prior year. The main reason for the reduction in operating cash flow was due to restructuring and legal settlement payments, investments in the business and lower cash from receivables as compared to prior year, namely a function of timing.","We have capital expenditures of $33.9 million in Q1, down slightly as compared to prior year. As we look forward, we anticipate the unfavorable cash flow timing to reverse and our cash flows to strengthen. As previously mentioned, we anticipate reducing working capital in 2019.","Moving now to our fiscal 2019 guidance. We are reaffirming our revenue, gross profit margin and operating income margin guidance for 2019. We are revising our effective tax rate guidance to 24% from previews 22.4%. And we are narrowing our range of adjusted EPS guidance to $2.30 to $2.40. With respect to the quarterly phasing in 2019, I would note that the first quarter came in stronger than we previously anticipated. This was due to several reasons. We have achieved a faster-than-anticipated ramp-up in production and sales for our PrimeScan units, and this boosted revenue and margins in the first quarter.","Our health care business was exceptionally strong in the first quarter of 2019. And finally, we had some planned first quarter operating expenses and investments that we now expect to occur in the second and third quarters. Consequently, looking to the second quarter, we anticipate that our internal revenue growth rate versus prior year will slow slightly relative to the first quarter, due to the pull forward of equipment sales in Q1. We expect our second quarter gross margins to be similar to our first quarter gross margins, and our second quarter SG&A will be slightly down to the prior year.","Net interest and other expense will be higher in the second quarter as we had a $6 million benefit in Q1 versus prior year that may not recur. We are very pleased with the performance of our business and the implementation of our restructuring efforts which are yielding growth and margin improvements. I very much value the commitment of our employees from around the world.","And with that I will now turn the call back over to Don.","Donald Casey","Thanks Nick. In addition to our financial results, I wanted to provide an update on the progress we are making on our restructuring and how we are positioning Dentsply Sirona for sustainable long-term growth.","Our restructuring plan is focused on accelerating growth, improving margins, while simplifying the organization. The foundation of that plan starts with creating a compelling vision for the company and building a world-class solution team. Significant progress is made during this quarter in several areas.","Our strategy is provided on slide 15 and it is designed to take advantage of Dentsply Sirona's unique assets and position in the market. Our success will also rely on providing singular leadership to the organization. Over the last months, new talent has been added to augment proven leaders and the company is now operating against our new model with clear direction and accountability.","These changes have been important and the organization feels it. The energy and commitment I've seen on our major trade shows like IDS and on a recent trip to Asia and participating in multiple kickoff meetings has been great.","In addition to our strategy, slide 15 outlines our key priorities of the restructuring. Our most important priority is to build the foundation for sustainable growth. That foundation is built around innovation, clinical education, expanding in the growing markets, and salesforce effectiveness. Given the importance of growth I would like to review the progress we are making against each of these initiatives.","Moving now to slide 17, you will see that innovation is critical to growth and accelerating it has been a major priority of this leadership team. As part of our restructuring we've made a change in our approach moving from a bottoms-up individual SBU approach to R&D -- to a portfolio approach.","The company now looks across our entire portfolio and can prioritize the most compelling innovations. This will allow us to focus on accelerating important initiatives based on the opportunity or competitive dynamics.","We started to see results from this approach in the first quarter. We successfully introduced a broad portfolio of new products starting at the Chicago Midwinter event and highlighted by the March IDS event in Cologne, Germany. The fact that we were able to prioritize that PrimeScan and accelerated its launch into the first quarter shows the importance of this approach. And as Dentsply Sirona is committed to leading to category in R&D investment, we believe this approach would be critical going forward.","One of the really compelling products that was highlighted at IDS as well as the Midwinter event was with PrimeScan as shown on slide 18. PrimeScan is a digital impression scanner that is lightning fast, easy to use, and takes extremely high-quality digital impressions.","At these events, we had we had novice dentist learning to use PrimeScan at our booth and then scanning both top and bottom arches in well under a minute. And PrimeScan is a truly open platform, so we now had a DI system that can create high-quality digital impressions that could be used by all the major lab-based manufacturing systems.","PrimeScan is an important innovation in the CAD\/CAM area and should help us drive additional penetration of chairside dentistry. But we also believe that PrimeScan will allow us to compete in the rapidly growing DI segment. Its unique characteristics will really accelerate digital workflows and allow us to take full advantage of our ortho and implant portfolios. The reaction from the dental community has been very positive. And as Nick mentioned earlier in this quarter, thanks to terrific work by our CAD\/CAM team, we were able to accelerate the availability of the product allowing us to get off to a faster than expected start to the year.","Our innovation story this quarter does not end with PrimeScan. At IDS, Dentsply Sirona had a global launch of our new SureSmile aligner software. SureSmile aligners and planning software deliver a complete clinician-controlled clear aligner treatment solution.","Another important launch was Surefil one, which is a breakthrough in the restorative dentistry area. The product was very well received at the IDS and will be available for shipment later in this year. It delivers outstanding results while significantly simplifying workflow.","We also launched the new generation of endodontic files TruNatomy, a product designed to preserve dental. So, overall, IDS was an important platform for Dentsply Sirona to generate global awareness and a great product launch platform for us. It also allowed us to present Dentsply Sirona as a single company committed to our customers and passion about innovation. We believe this will have a positive impact over the remainder of the year.","Another critical piece of our sustainable foundation for growth is the differentiated clinical education program. Our clinical affairs team consists of an international group of employees, developing educational curriculum to help train dental professionals.","Working with thought leaders, the academic and research communities, and practitioners in our local markets, our clinical affairs team provided approximately 12,000 clinical education programs during 2018. This resulted in more than 430,000 dental professionals participating in courses offered or supported by Dentsply Sirona during the year most of whom were dentists. We believe that this is a long-term differentiator for us.","Moving on to slide 21 and salesforce effectiveness. In past calls, we have discussed the importance of making sure that the major investment Dentsply Sirona makes in sales and marketing is optimized. To deliver against that goal, we completed a major analysis of the market resulting in a much more in-depth view of our customer priorities, segmentation, and buying patterns.","Based off that analysis, a go-to-market strategy was developed that included a major salesforce effectiveness program. Major parts of that program included creating a common country management team, an integrated approach to sales and marketing, and a common CRM platform and an improvement in targeting and call planning.","In this quarter, we rolled out that program in the U.S. It involved extensive training and moving the salespeople into their new roles and the roll out of our new CRM system. This is a significant amount of change and we are very focused on managing the organization through it to ensure strong execution.","The vitality of the dental category is clearly demonstrated by growth in several regions and Dentsply Sirona is one of the leaders in this area. Slide 22 details that focused support can help us to expand and growing markets.","As Nick covered earlier, these initiatives are continuing to pay dividends particularly as the rest of the world grew by 8.1% this quarter and reflects the success we are having in tapping into these high potential areas.","The second major priority of the restructuring plan was to take steps needed to create substantial improvements in our margin. In this quarter we begin to see the benefits of some of those steps. As the chart on slide 23 clearly shows, we saw progress in the first quarter of 2019. This was driven by expense control, portfolio shaping, and headcount management. I would like to provide some details on each of these.","Our headcount goals are outlined on slide 24 and as you can see, we are targeting a net headcount reduction of 6% to 8% by 2021. That will bring us down to between 15,000 and 15,300 employees from the roughly 16,300 we had in November 2018.","At this point, our headcount reductions are tracking ahead of plan and we achieved an employee target of just less than 15,600 at the end of March and we remain on track to deliver our goals by the end of 2020.","I have also mentioned a positive impact of portfolio management on the first quarter. Starting in late 2018, we began exiting underperforming businesses, thus reducing cost and complexity. We previously reported that we had exited SICAT, FONA, and the Surgical business of Wellspect. And in the first quarter, we exited the 1-800-DENTIST business. That brings to four the number of business we have sold or exited since we announced the restructuring in November of 2018.","This is an ongoing effort as we assess additional candidates for portfolio shaping with a focus on improving topline growth and cost savings. Simplifying the organization was also a major priority of the restructuring. As discussed in the growth and margin improvement areas we have made good progress across the Board.","That work continued in the first quarter as we drove the changes throughout the entire organization. Slide 26 details the organizational changes that we are in the process of making. At this point, we have finished both the SBU and RCO consolidations and we have discussed our new process within our R&D.","Our supply chain consolidation is also in process. For perspective, our supply chain has historically been run at the business unit or country level. Consolidating this will allow us to leverage critical areas for scale that include manufacturing, global planning, logistics, distribution and procurement.","Further, moving to one supply chain will allow for scale improved costs and we believe enhanced reliability. We put a strong leadership team in place and we will look to build out the supply chain organization gradually to make sure there is no disruption in customer service.","As part of the restructuring plan, we have outlined our financial targets. In terms of revenue growth, we maintained our view that Consumables will have steady growth of 2% to 3%. Technology & Equipment has returned to growth this year now that we have resolved our 2018 inventory destocking and benefiting from the launch of substantial innovations.","We are providing this level of detail on metrics for the next few years because our Board and management team is committed to increasing transparency on our plans and ultimately our successful execution.","2019 will be a year focused on execution and we are in the process of accelerating EPS growth in the near-term as we act on cost-saving opportunities. As we've shown in our 2019 guidance, growing revenue with expense discipline gives us strong EPS leverage. Initially, it's important for us to maintain an investment-grade rating to enable us to best utilize our balance sheet going forward.","So, to close, it was a solid quarter for which I would like to thank the entire Dentsply Sirona team for their tireless work and the progress they are making. The quarter showed the importance of disciplined execution and the power of new products. There have been imported tangible steps taken against the plan we have laid out. We've also said that progress against our goals will not to be in a straight line and we are in the process of making -- managing a very significant management change.","But I'm very pleased to see the organization rising to the challenge. They bring passion and commitment about delivering for our patients, customers, employees, and shareholders every day. And we look forward to continuing to update you on the progress we are making throughout 2019.","And with that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. ","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Maybe I'll start with Consumables. I think backing out the Easter headwind; they were still only up about 1% versus down 1% and 1.3% comp. Can you maybe just talk to that dynamic a little bit more? I know you called out some IDS impact, so just curious what's your view on Consumables right now?","Nick Alexos","Thanks, Tycho. A couple of things. Whenever we have one of the businesses that that isn\u2019t performing at where we expected, we spent a lot of time looking at it. But I tell you around Consumables, right now a couple of things. First, we're very comfortable with where we are forecasting for the year.","As you mentioned -- look IDS, we had some products that we are launching that actually gets shift in the back half of the year which we think we'll give some good momentum there. We noted that there was a day that was different year-on-year.","As you really peel it back, one of the things that we keep focused on is what are we to be to develop plans to accelerate it and whether its new products or whether it's things like our SFE program. We're pretty optimistic that we will see good momentum around Consumables as we get through that the year.","And Tycho the one thing I point out -- and we don't talk about this enough, but I was trying to put it in script as rest of world. I mean right now our rest of world Consumables business has grown 4%. We're seeing good margin there. And as that continues to grow and become more important to our overall business, we see an opportunity a little bit of momentum there. So, Consumables, we're very focused on it, comfortable with the year. I think we've got plans in place and we'll go from there.","Tycho Peterson","And then on PrimeScan, obviously, good traction out of gate here. A couple of questions here. Just as we think about the Omnicam upgrade path, if you could touch on that. And how should we think about PrimeScan drive the incremental CEREC sales, are you starting to have some of those discussions?","Donald Casey","Yes. I mean, I would tell you our priority right now on PrimeScan is to make sure that we are selling whole systems and we are bringing new doctors into the CEREC Doctor. Community. I mean that's been the priority. And to-date, we've seen good success.","We've been gratified also that a lot of our current CEREC doctors have wanted to come back and update their whole system. But look right now we are seeing very, very good sales around PrimeScan. We're going to evaluate whether we want to do an omni-upgrade in the back of the year. At this point, we have not made that decision.","But as we see how the year plays out and we see what demand is versus our ability to actually produce this, we'll make that decision as the year goes on. But right now we're pretty happy with what we're seeing in terms of the mix on PrimeScan versus -- the full unit versus DI and we're also pretty happy with what we're seeing in terms of incremental doctors coming into the community.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just one quick one for Nick before I hop off. The operating margin forecast, you kept it unchanged despite the upside in the quarter. Was there any kind of pull-forward on some of the cost actions or why didn't operating margin targets come up a little bit?","Nick Alexos","Yes Tycho. Thank you. We feel pretty good about the full year number. Q1 was really good. There's some timing on expenditures that we expect now to happen more in Q2, Q3. So, overall, pretty good feeling on the outlook and the plans to reduce the OpEx to the lower level versus prior year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning guys. Congrats on the results. Just a quick question for me around PrimeScan as it relates to clear aligners and interoperability with other third-party software and case submission capabilities. I guess more specifically just want to hear more about how you balance the strategy of using PrimeScan to drive sales of your own clear aligners versus just maximizing sales of PrimeScan itself by just aligning for the case submissions in relation to competing clear aligner products like in Invisalign. Thanks.","Donald Casey","Yes. Again thanks for the question. From a strategic standpoint, we decided that the best thing we can do is focus on what is best for the dentist. And basically what our KOLs and everyone is telling us is look, keep the systems open and we are committed to doing that. And whether that's our mill, whether that's our DI units or other things, we believe that's the right way to go.","In terms of -- and I know you've seen some of this stuff, if you're Midwinter or you\u2019re at IDS, it was interesting how we put PrimeScan and then you could not leave the PrimeScan display without going in and seeing SureSmile. And we launched new software there at both Midwinter and IDS. And it\u2019s a very good reaction. Our GP software has been very, very well received.","And right now we feel very good that a year after its acquisition, we're in a position that we're going to be able to rollout SureSmile. We feel pretty good about the fact that it's root to crown program. We feel -- the fact that we were able to integrate PrimeScan with that software right out of the gate is indicative of how we want to run Dentsply Sirona in the future.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. The other quick question here just on PrimeScan sales in the quarter. Just hoping to hear hopefully on a confirmatory basis that you have strong visibility placements into the actual end market versus how much of your sales in the first quarter here was just driven by sales into the distribution channel. Just hoping to hear that there's overly strong correlation on end market placements as well.","Donald Casey","Yes. I think after 2018, one of the priorities we came out, we've got to be focused on inventory movement down to the weak. And we feel, particularly in the U.S., with our dealer partners that we had extremely good visibility. And we feel at this point right now that there is not an inventory build at all.","Actually -- and talking to the dealer partners, right now, we are in enviable position of -- this stuff is moving very, very quickly and we're actually working aggressively to make sure that they have enough products in all their districts to actually be able to demo. So, right now, the product is moving very, very well. There has not been an inventory build and one of the systems that we really feel strongly that coming out 2018 is we've got to have visibility into the Technology & Equipment inventory down to the weekly and daily basis we do have that.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Hi thanks. Question about Europe. I think typically coming out of IDS; you'd expect kind of a surge of equipment sales in Q2 and Q3. Are you expecting that this time around?","Nick Alexos","Yes, John, IDS is interesting. We're starting to look at it based on what we're seeing is almost a bifurcation where it's become a shopping event and not as much of a buying event. And I know you guys are there. Look, we feel extremely good about the fact that we had 160,000 dentists from around the world that we were able to launch our new products to, whether that's PrimeScan, whether that was Surefil, whether that was SureSmile. I mean we had nine major launches. TruNatomy, we introduced a imaging system that's particularly appropriate for Europe. So, we feel the audience there was great and lots of hands on experience.","What we are seeing though is look they were shopping, they're learning about the products and we expect that we will start seeing buying patterns spread out through the year as opposed to looking at IDS as a specific buying event. As we've gone back and looked at it and what we're hearing across the market that seems to be pretty consistent with what we're hearing. So, look we think IDS was really important to us.","If you look at 2018 and the lack of new products we had and compared that to 2019, we were kicking off what we think is a very aggressive portfolio. The fact that we were able to lean and really talk to -- almost 20% of the dentists from around the world show up at that event in one shot. We think that's important to us.","And look I think sales will take care of themselves over the rest of the year and particularly when we launched some of the Consumable stuff that we're not even shipping to the third and fourth quarter, we're going to see somewhat of a delayed impact on that. But we felt good that IDS was a good launch platform. I think in the future, it's going to be interesting to watch whether that becomes more of a shopping event than a buying event.","John Kreger","Interesting. Okay. Thank you. And then one other follow-up on your salesforce effectiveness comments. It sounded like you wrote-out the new structure in the U.S. in the first quarter. What should we be thinking about in terms of other major countries and when you'll be moving forward with that?","Donald Casey","Yes. Right now the next on the docket is the dock which what we refer to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. We're in the process of moving that in China. China and dock are both kind of Q2, Q3 and Japan is -- we're in the process of putting the foundation down. That will be a kind of back half of the year into 2020 event.","In some of the other regions, particularly in Europe, we tend to look at that as kind of third quarter event, but right now, the biggest thing for us John is obviously U.S. is a really important market for us. We did that late in the quarter and got everybody in swim lanes now. The nice thing about salesforce.com is that we can see how fast things are moving and we can monitor that. So, a lot of change. So far we're happy with what's going on. But look we're going to watch that like a hawk over the next two quarters and we'll roll it out -- what we learn in the U.S., we can also spill out in the rest of the world.","John Kreger","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Hi, this is Erin. So, going back to a little bit of a previous question here, but on the distributor stocking versus end market demand trends and the impacts sort of the quarter, I guess should we continue to see the momentum quarter-to-quarter on the equipment side? Or should we see some volatility or lumpiness there normalizing for the destocking that happened last year? Just want to make sure that there are no surprising or air pockets due to distributor stocking, particularly as it relates to the PrimeScan launch. Thanks.","Donald Casey","Yes, thanks Erin. We don't like surprises. Let's -- and we really don't like air pockets. So, look as we laid out our guidance for the year, we feel that first, we have to take into account a very significant change and how inventories was managed at the dealers in the -- beginning in the second quarter, rolling through the third and fourth. We feel we understand that and it's reflected in what we're reflecting in our guidance right now.","Look I would tell you the positive surprise was we got more machines than we thought which abled us to get off in the first quarter. And I'm telling you we're very happy with the response and to be honest, the response has been a little bit stronger than we thought coming right out of the gate.","As we looked in the back half of the year, we don't see big changes in terms of dealer destocking or other things. I think it's been a challenge for us to just make sure that we correctly model the inventory destocking and what that impact looks like on comparative quarters. But we feel that we've done that and reflected in the guidance.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then can you speak to the strategy around continuing to sell Omnicam as well as a PrimeScan, assuming that they are marketed at somewhat of a tiered offering? Could you speak to the opportunity on that front? And how that strategy will play out? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Sure. In the short-term, we don't have PrimeScan approved all over the world, so we're still waiting for registration in critical markets. So, Omni will continue to be an important product in several parts of the world where it might be a year plus before we get the registrations.","And then second, a year ago, we were not competing in the DI business. I mean sure, CEREC had done a lot and it had DI capabilities, but one of the strategic changes that I credit the team for making is, this market is growing. It's important and we believe DI is de facto going to become a standard of practice in the dentist office and we better compete there.","We feel right now that we're offering multiple price tiers with different performance and right now, we're committed to that strategy. What we're seeing -- and again, we've been very gratified is that the capabilities of PrimeScan just the ease of use -- Erin, I know you've actually used this, this product is really, really good product. So, we're going to continue offering Omni. We may have gotten the Omni\/Prime mix off a little bit, but Omni will continue to sell and make Omni, it's important the rest of the world, we're going to make it available in this market. So far though we've been seeing people are really, really excited about the new product.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is Jason on for Jeff. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start on orthodontics, just didn\u2019t hear a lot of commentary on that business and how it performed broadly. So, if you can provide any color on how that business is running, especially with the SureSmile clear aligner and then give any metrics on how that's been staring in the really in dental community.","Donald Casey","Yes. Thanks Jason. We're pretty happy with our performance right now. We're not giving a lot of specifics to it. But look in our mind, SureSmile was important -- first buying OR [ph] metrics which we did about a year ago, and it's taking us little while to integrate it and get all the products we need available to us. We feel we've got that.","We think orthodontics will be a future story as opposed to what's going on in the last quarter. But we've been happy with the ortho performance and we're excited about the opportunity that's in front of us.","And in terms of metrics, it's -- we're not going to provide a whole heck of lot around it. But I would tell you that both among orthos and generalists that do some ortho procedures, the reaction has been very positive for SureSmile. And the nice thing for us is when you actually show PrimeScan and you show the software, it works pretty well.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Just one quick follow-up there. F I may ask a second question I mean, did orthodontics to grow in the quarter or are you not going to provide that level of detail?","Nick Alexos","Jason ortho is performing well, it's not just material in terms of its scale and certainly -- or metrics. It was a relatively small revenue business, but strategically, it's very important, particularly, when you line it with our scanner equipment business. So we're pleased.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then shifting over to implants. How you're thinking about the growth of the implant business this year is as Straumann just started rolling out a new premium product in the past month or so, Danner has a new material coming later this year. Our [Indiscernible] is just Danner reps have been especially aggressive here in recent month ahead of Straumann BLX launch. So, we're just hoping you can comment on your implant business and competitive position in light of what's unfolding in the market?","Donald Casey","Nick mentioned in his script that we saw positive growth on the implant business in the first quarter and we think we have an opportunity to see that for the rest of the year.","I would tell you that -- I would love to see our implant business accelerate. I think we've got the pieces in place. We've got brands. We've had some good launches at Azento, less about material and more about focusing on dentists. We have also our MIS business, which we\u2019re seeing good reaction to, which is kind of value playing with that generalists. So look we are happy that we saw implants grow. I think we have more opportunity there as we go forward and as we look out at the year, we expect implants to be a positive on this share.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks guys.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cherney with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Cherney","Good morning and thanks so much for the question. Just thinking more about Consumables, and more of a medium-term question versus short-term question. When you think about your performance this quarter versus what you look at for the rest of the year and the multiyear plan, I guess Don how do the conditions of the market have to change for things to move to the upper end or potentially above your long-term targets versus what would have to happen from market perspective for you to come in at the low end or below the long-term targets relative to consumers growth it in particular?","Donald Casey","Michael, I actually don't think it's a market issue. I actually think the Consumable market has been relatively steady and one of the things our analysis has been showing is if you look at the Consumable business, which we all portray as is incredibly reliable, consistent business, on an annual basis it's relatively consistent. There's a little bit more movement quarter-to-quarter.","We spent a lot of time looking at quarterly movements and it's almost as if you get a positive quarter and then you see a little softness. So first, I don't think it's a market. I think the underlying market is fine. And by the way, I've mentioned in my script and I'll mention it again, we get excited about -- when we're out looking at our Consumable business in places like Middle East, Eastern Europe, China, Brazil we're seeing high single-digit growth. And we feel good about that.","The second reason that we talk about two to three as an important number for us is we've got a fair amount of new products that are coming in the back half of the year. And we showed them at IDS where there\u2019s stuff like short anatomy and some of our lab introductions, we feel we have an opportunity to get after putting some innovation in an area that has not seen as much innovation.","And just the last point I'd bring up, one of the reasons that we've been so adamant about things like sales force effectiveness is, we believe that we've got a percent Dentsply Sirona, the company and the portfolio to the dentists and the biggest change and how we\u2019re approaching the dentist is we are now approaching them as Dentsply Sirona, which we think will have a positive impact on both the technology and equipment and the Consumable business, because we\u2019re now showing how we can help them on a broader procedure basis.","So look Consumables, obviously, judging by the questions, Consumables is on people's mind. We -- I just hit it one more; we\u2019re comfortable with where we think the year is. Long-term we do think it's a 2% to 3% grower. We like our new products and some of the plans we have put in place. And we're comfortable with where Consumables are.","Michael Cherney","That\u2019s all for me. Thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the questions. Don, maybe starting on PrimeScan, can you talk about how the selling cycle for DI would compare to kind of the full CAD\/CAM system as we think about how demand might ramp over the course of the year? And then how do you feel about the manufacturing capacity that you guys have right now in order to meet the level of demand that you're seeing?","Donald Casey","Yes. DI is shorter than full chairside. I think it's an interesting question for us. I think this IDS was really important as you saw a bunch of scanners launched. The fact that the products have gotten as easy to use as they are I do feel you're finally going to see that transition into much more digital dentistry where people are going to basically look to scan every patient when they come and that way you can show longitudinal, you can show gun progression and few other things.","So we think DI is shorter then full chairside and we think that the wave will happen relatively quickly which is why we made the strategic decision we've got to jump into DI. That being said, we're pretty darn happy so far with the fact that with the ease of use of PrimeScan coupled with our entire chairside system, we are bringing Dennis who may have been on the fence into the fold. And we're seeing a good pickup of whole systems.","In terms of manufacturing very -- look to be 100% honest, I'd like love to have a couple of more these things right now. But we're very -- we feel good that the pace that's ramping up in the second quarter is going to allow us to meet all the demand that we see from the marketplace right now. So credits to the team to accelerate some of the availability that availability is ramping very, very quickly. It's important for us to maintain high quality as we do that ramp and we've been insistent on that. But we feel by -- for the year, we have all the capacity we need. We feel really good about that capacity as it plays out the second quarter.","Nathan Rich","Okay. Great. And then a Nick a couple of follow-ups for you. Do you size the pulled forward that you saw on technology growth in the quarter from the stronger-than-expected equipment sales? And then my second one is just on these savings will you be willing to share kind of the run rate that you are at after 1Q. And is $60 million of savings still the right target for this year?","Nick Alexos","Okay. So on the last one Nathan 60 is still the target. We feel very good about the restructuring plan. It is more back-end loaded, but we started seeing savings and we have carryover of savings from last year. In terms of run rate SG&A, we feel good as I said earlier to Tycho's question that we're going to end up the OpEx below prior year just the timing of some of the expenditures and savings given the multinational elements of the company are hard to predict, so overall pretty good about it.","And it's hard to quantify the exact amount of pull-forward of equipment in Q1, but there definitely was -- midwinter was a good lunch for PrimeScan. And we had the production accelerated and we saw some of the quarter, but as Don said we're really producing to real demand and feel pretty good about the momentum through the results of the year.","Nathan Rich","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Great. Hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. The first one will just be the pricing pressure that picked up in the industry really in 2018 I think notably around imaging Nick or Don has that moderated or stabilized? I'm just curious of that sort of tracking according to your expectations and early 2019 Nick, just want to find out a little bit more about competitors and their rationale behavior out there. And then I've got a follow-up.","Donald Casey","Sure, John. Thanks for the question. On it's almost two questions there. Is it tracking to our expectations? The answer is yes. When we look out at 2019 and putting a forecast together, we anticipate that there was going to be a pricing pressure on imaging. That being said, as we look at imaging, we made some significant changes particularly in the North American market and how we manage promotion to become more competitive in the first quarter of 2018. And we are now in the process of lapping that. So \u2013 is there pricing pressure going on in the imaging market? The answer is yes. Is it tracking to what we thought it would be and have we taken into account? The answer is also yes.","Jon Block","Okay. Got it. And then just to go back to some PrimeScan comments. When you say the mix was off, can you just \u2013 maybe get a bit more granular. In other words, in the markets where you have both offerings approved is to say, I'll throw out number, is it 80, 20 PrimeScan Omni split? And if it's skewed heavily towards PrimeScan maybe just comment on the dentists behavior. In other words their willingness to spend an extra 10 or 15k for high-end DI's since maybe it's used continuously at their practice for our range of restorative procedures? Thanks guys.","Nick Alexos","Yes. Thanks, John. I'm not going to give you specific a break on what the forecast was for Prime versus Omni. My comments stands though. We've sold to a more Prime than we thought. And obviously, that's going to be cannibalized Omnicam. The nice thing for as with Omni production is it's still a great camera and it stole sold in the rest of world. So we will be able to manage that. And you hit the nail on the head, what we conceived from dentists and whether it's a new dentist or whether it's actually a set of doctors that's been using Omni, the cameras really get.","And basically, how we're selling it and what here being very responsive to it this is a product that they're going to used for five to six years. And when you actually look at the capabilities that a product and the durability by the way, we've done stuff like making the sanitization of it a lot easier, the touch screen just makes it \u2013 the entire thing we feel offers terrific value particularly when you measure relatively modest difference over the course of three to five years.","So we're very happy with the products. We're very happy with where we are right now. And one thing, I would stress to you also on PrimeScan. PrimeScan is not something that \u2013 by the way we're going to launching Primescan \u2013 that's the last thing that you're going to see for PrimeScan from the next five years we\u2019ve really feel it\u2019s a platform that we can incorporate a lot of things. I mean, when you start putting a 24-inch touch screen that can roll into every dentist's office we get pretty excited about the things that we can do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard, Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick one for Nick. Just if you could elaborate on the first quarter OpEx push out exactly what's that\u2019s tied too and if you can sort of quantify how that that benefited the first quarter specifically? Thanks.","Nick Alexos","Yes, Brandon. I mean, we're kind of anchoring on Q2 last year and same will be below that, but obviously above Q1. There are expenditures for sales force investments. Other work that we're doing to implement the restructuring data from a timing standpoint slipped into more Q2-Q3. So I would range it if you look between where we ended up Q1 and where we were last year, is kind of the range that might slip into Q2-Q3 impact. That's how I'd say it.","Brandon Couillard","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from a Kevin Caliendo with UBS. ","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I want to go back to Consumables really quick. Do you guys think that you're growing faster than the market? And I know you talked about sort of rest of world Consumables being up and that would imply certain negative U.S. market for Consumables. Is that a fair comment? Like how should we think about your positioning, you'd expect 2% to 3% with some product launches. I'm assuming you're growing a little faster than the market. In that case, is that fair?","Nick Alexos","I'd say in this quarter, at retail we're probably growing at market and we'd like to see that accelerated. I would say based on our shipments right now, we're probably just a scosche below.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay, great. And on the -- on PrimeScan, I know there's been some question about you being validated by Align and the timing of all that. Is there an expectation that if and when that were to happen, that would accelerate sales of PrimeScan? Are you expecting down in any way, shape or form? Or how should we think about that, if and when it were to \u2013 if it when \u2013 if and when it were to happen much later this year, at some point in the future?","Donald Casey","Yes. I mean if it happens, it's a positive for us. We \u2013 at first, we have a very good working relationship with the folks that Align. And we made a request and we're waiting their answer. And, obviously, Align is going to do what's in the best interest of Align. But your point is, it would be upside if we in fact didn't see that validation came across.","Kevin Caliendo","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. ","Glen Santangelo","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Nick, I just want to unpack some of the comments that you made on margins in your prepared remarks. If you back out the impact of the restructuring initiatives for a second and you sort of think about your two businesses of Equipment and Consumable, I thought you kind of made it sound like, the upside margin really came from stronger equipment in particular PrimeScan and maybe some of that was mitigated or offset.","I think you said 80 basis points of the decline on the Consumables side. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of color, sort of, on your gross margins? And maybe what's going on there with respect to mix? And what are some of the puts and takes on that?","Nick Alexos","Yes. I mean, there's a whole -- Glenn, we saw better margins as we've ramped up production. If you look at inventory in Q4 versus our Q1, we certainly produced more and that truly makes for better margins in the business. Certainly, the technology and equipment mix was favorable. And that certainly helped. I think, overall, we had at good mix of business.","On the Consumables side, you compared to prior year, we did have higher supply chain cost, but right now we're looking at a full year of restructuring that's going to be kick in Q2 to Q4 where we'll see the benefit. So year-over-year comparisons still aren't positive on the Consumables, but we expect them to be. On the total year basis, we're very much on the plan that we outlined from a margin standpoint. A little bit stronger in Q1 than we expected.","Glen Santangelo","And maybe just as a follow-up to that margin question, just sort of looking out to the balance of the year, maybe a little bit longer term. Earlier in the Q&A, you sort of talked about the price competition on equipment but could you maybe talk about the growth in DSOs in the business maybe the evolution of the distribution channel and supply chain issues that you're talking about, are there any sort a big trends that you think are worth calling out either positive or negative that we should think about it in your margins going forward?","Nick Alexos","Yes. I'll comment on the margin, and I'm sure Don has got some thoughts on the market. But overall, we don't see any change in our margin profile because of anything going on in the channel and we continue to have a good relationship with both our dealers as well as our DSOs.","Donald Casey","Yes. And look obviously the DSOs are making significant progress in the marketplace and we feel that we're working really, really well with them. One of the reasons that we're centralizing our supply chain is the anticipation that as a swing shift that we want to have a good solid platform where we can make sure our costs are in line.","So look, long-term we've seen the emergence of value segments. We want to be able to be very, very competitive in those and we\u2019ve work to do to get there. But right now, it's very interesting. When we can show what innovation can do in terms of mitigating pricing pressure. And in my mind one of the reasons that we spend as much money as we do in R&D and I really want to make sure that the organization is as sufficient as we can be is you bring in real innovation and this category is going to reward it.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. Thank you.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Glen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yi Chen with H.C. Wainwright.","Yi Chen","Thank you for taking my question. Given the strong growth trend in China and Latin America, would you say that the overall growth rate for rest of world revenue in 2019 could be above the growth rate in the U.S. and Europe? And also could you clarify whether the destocking has occurred in all geographic areas or just in certain countries?","Nick Alexos","Yes. I'll take the second first, it\u2019s Nick. The destocking is pretty much out of the system on equipment side as we mentioned and we monitored it very closely. It was mostly U.S. issue, but actually in the end of the year, we destock even more than we expected in the European markets.","In terms of mix rest of world is strong -- growing stronger for us. Don has identified some of the markets where we're making investments, but I think we are also expanding in other markets within those continents, certainly, Asia, as an example. So rest of world will be higher growth rate than certainly North America and Europe as a whole.","Yi Chen","Thank you.","Nick Alexos","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Rogers with Great Lakes Review.","Jason Rogers","Yes. Just a question on guidance. You talked about a lot about of positive today Primescan surprising to the upside, headcount reduction is coming in faster than you thought, distributor inventory is potentially low. Just with all that interested in why you kept the top end of your EPS guidance the same? That just general conservatism given you\u2019re early in the restructuring? Or is anything else out there that may give you some caution?","Nick Alexos","Yes, Jason, overall we feel good about the year. We obviously feel good about the quarter as well. I did note our effective tax rate is a little higher based on a refinement of the geography of the earnings. And FX, which is a bit of a headwind with the strong dollar. So you do have other factors that Jeff included. But overall right now we're early in the year with a quarter behind us and we felt good about tightening the bottom range and I expected full year results to be on plan.","Jason Rogers","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Sweeney.","John Sweeney","Thank you very much for joining us today and we're very happy with the progress of our restructuring and how we're performing. We look forward to catching up as we move forward and keep you updated on our progress as we move through the year. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day."],"6898":["DENTSPLY International (NASDAQ:XRAY) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  9, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Derek W.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Derek W. Leckow","Thank you very much, Mark. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's first quarter 2013 results. Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and CFO; and Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President and COO. We'll have some prepared remarks and then we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have. I hope you had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of that press release is also available for download on our website at www.dentsply.com. We've also provided a set of supplemental slides to accompany this call, also available for download in the Investor Relations section.","Before we get started, it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","As you can see in the release, our results this quarter included a number of nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP adjustments. Our comments on this call will focus on results, including certain adjustments that provide operational insight, excluding these items. These items are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You will note that our earnings guidance is also presented on an adjusted basis. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret W. Wise","Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter call this morning.","Now before we get started, I'd like to comment on the executive changes that we made in early April, and as you probably have seen in our earlier announcement, Chris Clark, DENTSPLY's President, has now also assumed the Chief Financial role. As you probably know, while we have a matrixed organization and Chris now has responsibilities for essentially all the corporate functional organizations. That includes business development and strategy, finance, HR, R&D, manufacturing, logistics, IT and clinical. Chris has a -- has very strong business and finance skills and a keen knowledge of operational matters and, of course, will be playing a key role in taking our organization to the next level, including finding ways to better leverage our cost across the breadth -- the very broad platform that we have.","Also announced in April is that Jim Mosch, DENTSPLY's Executive VP, has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Jim has a wealth of operating experience, including a very long tenure here at DENTSPLY, and this is a very strong next logical step for him and for the company. Jim has had oversight responsibilities for over half of our businesses in the past and now has responsibly for the full operating group. Jim also has strong capabilities in organizational design and management and is uniquely suited to this new role. Jim's been on these calls in the past primarily in his role in business development, so some of you already know him.","Now we believe this new structure and the team we have in place will position us well to create value and capitalize on the opportunities that we have for the company going forward.","Now before moving to our results, I'd like to make a few observations about market conditions. There are several factors that are creating noise in the results in the first quarter. And as we discussed in our fourth quarter call, the first quarter this year had 2 less selling days than last year. The number of selling days has a strong correlation to sales growth for direct businesses and, to a lesser degree, for businesses that go through distribution. Also we and most of our competitors implemented price increases January 1, which likely resulted in an inventory build in the channel in the fourth quarter. Both of these factors as well as timing of the holidays, major trade shows, et cetera, can distort results in the short-term.","Cutting through all this noise, our take is that the U.S. market is generally consistent with what we saw last year, stable and continuing to grow, probably low-single digits. In Europe, we believe the markets may have had some mild weakening as we enter 2013, although again it's difficult to tell given the selling day issue and the timing of the holidays and the trade shows. Regionally, Southern Europe certainly is continuing to contract while Northern Europe showed a little less strength to offset by contraction in the south in the quarter.","In the Rest of World category, which includes probably close to 100 country markets, we believe that the emerging markets continue to grow mid single-digits and, in some cases, higher or even double digits, while developed countries in this category are showing low growth or perhaps even flat growth.","Obviously, all these market assessments are vast generalizations across very wide and diverse regions, but overall, that's how we see it at this point.","Moving to DENTSPLY's results for the quarter. At a very high level, we had sales up 2.2% in total and 1.1% without precious metal. Earnings were flat, reflecting low internal growth, but also -- which, of course, was influenced by these 2 shipping days but also reflecting a decline in our operating margins year-over-year that we believe is temporary, and which we'll comment on further today on the call.","First, on sales for the quarter. Internal growth came in at a positive 1.6%, with the U.S. up 1.9%, Europe at a positive 0.8%, and the Rest of World growing a positive 2.9%. Again, all of these percentages are as reported and do not adjust for the 2 less shipping days in the quarter. Also internal growth for the quarter x ortho and x Japan was up 1.3%. Overall, based on the reports that we've seen thus far, we believe this is above the growth rate for the global dental consumable market for the quarter.","Internal growth of a positive 1.9% in the U.S. was led by our dental specialties products, lab and our non-dental businesses, with share side consumables basically flat. I think there are several important considerations here for the U.S., including that we were going up against a positive 7.4% internal growth comp in the first quarter of last year and we had 2 less selling days this year.","This created a very high hurdle that was difficult to overcome this quarter. Complicating this a bit, we did implement price increases in the U.S. on January 1 of this year. And as we noted on our fourth quarter call, it's clear the dealers bought ahead of that price increase in the fourth quarter. That certainly had a positive impact in the fourth quarter and a negative impact here in the first quarter. But I think it's important to note that we believe that channel inventories probably still are high at the end of the first quarter this year.","In Europe, as noted earlier, the markets are facing some pressure and we had some company specific events that also influenced our performance this quarter. Our internal growth in Europe was just under 1%. That was led by the dental specialties, the consumables and the non-dental products. Implants were negative in part due to our go-live events and our integration program for 2 very large markets in Europe in January. In one market in particular, Germany, we took that reps out of the field for an extended period of time for training. And that weighed -- that certainly weighed on our results there in the first quarter. We believe that this was an important and a necessary investment for us to make for the long-term despite the temporary disruption to sales that we experienced. Jim is going to speak to the integration and, of course, he'll speak to this issue further.","In Europe, moving forward, we have several important product launches this year, which we believe gives us a good opportunity to boost growth in the back half.","In Rest of World, our results were led by growth in our specialty group, but we also had good performance in lab products and in non-dental. We had particularly strong growth regionally in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America, while results were down in Japan.","On a worldwide basis for the product categories, internal growth was strongest in our dental specialties and in our medical business while share side consumables were slightly positive and lab was slightly negative. And again, that's all -- all those comparisons are with 2 less selling days.","Dental implants were negative this quarter, reflecting the integration and the 2 less selling days and, again, Jim will provide more color on this. Despite the temporary impact from the integration this quarter, we remain pleased with the overall performance of our global dental implant business, particularly given the market growth that we have right now. We also continue to be impressed with the medical device business we acquired in the same transaction 2011.","Just a few comments on earnings. Adjusted EPS was flat for the quarter, and that's reflecting the low growth and the lower operating margin year-over-year as well as a slightly higher share count. The margin compression was due in part to the short selling days but also due to mix and the German integration. Both Jim and Chris have important factors to comment on here. But at a very high level, we have plans and we see good opportunities to improve the margin picture as we move through the year and also into next year.","On guidance, we're looking at slower markets than we expected in Europe at the beginning of the year and currency exchange has moved against us by several cents. We're getting some help from a lower tax rate to offset both those issues but not enough to fully mitigate it. We have plans in place that should improve margins as we move through the year and some opportunities for capital deployment that should also help. Given all these factors, we see -- at present, we're revising our guidance to a range of $2.33 to $2.43 for the full year. Given the results for the first quarter, this implies earnings growth of 6.5% to 12.5% for the remainder of the year. That concludes my comments. I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim.","James G. Mosch","Thank you, Bret. From an operations perspective, let me provide an update on the integration activities and performance, our key product launches and also frame the expectations in these areas.","I first like to talk about the implant integration. As you are aware, we'd been working over last year on the integration of Astra Tech Dental and DENTSPLY Friadent implant businesses. The overriding objective of this integration was to create a single global implant business. The integration process has been strategically and organizationally comprehensive. And while we recognized some synergies in 2012, we expect to recognize further synergies through manufacturing and in-sourcing, distribution consolidation and the leverage of overhead cost as we move forward. At the country level, the integration has involved the consolidation of locations, moving to a single sales force with a combined product portfolio and leveraging SG&A cost.  No doubt there is some disruption to this process as we merge territories, realign customers and retrain the majority of the organization. However, despite these challenges and distractions, we were able to grow above market in each quarter 2012.","Our first country integration was North America, which occurred May 1, 2012. Systematically, we have moved country-by-country around the world to complete the integration. In January of this year, we integrated 2 large countries in Europe: Germany and France. At this point, we only have 1 large market left to integrate, which is Japan, and we expect to complete this process in the second quarter.","Germany is our largest and most complex location, particularly as both of the pre-acquisition businesses enjoyed meaningful market share. As a result of the German integration, we combined the 2 organizations and created a single DENTSPLY implants Germany business. At the same time, we separated the previous corporate and manufacturing organizations associated with DENTSPLY Friadent and their world headquarters and integrated them into the corporate organization of the new DENTSPLY implants. One of the key requirements was the need to train the organization, particularly the field force, regarding product portfolios, new territory definitions and new procedures. As a result, the field force was out of their territories 2 to 3 weeks in Q1. Of course, having them out of the field did have a negative impact on our sales growth in Germany. This was impactful to the sales per day in the January, February time frame, but we then recovered in March and we expect to return to normal levels in Q2. However, I would like to underscore this impact to our implant business. Given the size of the German business, this had a meaningful impact on our overall results for the global implant business, where we saw sales contract low- to mid-single digits versus a solid prior year comparison. However, it is important to note that absent the impact in Germany, our global implant sales, constant currency, were flat to slightly positive for the quarter despite being short 2 billing days.","I'd now like to move away from the implant business and review our sales and marketing activities. The first quarter was very active. There were 2 large dental conferences, the Chicago Midwinter in February and, in March, the biannual International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany. Both these shows were very well attended and we showed and launched a wide range of new innovations at each. In total, this included more than 10 new products, some are in the market now and others will launch later in the year. Of particular interest are the following: in the preventive segment, we launched 2 new fluoride varnishes, NUPRO varnish and Durashield, that have a higher fluoride release and faster hypersensitivity relief than other products in the market. This is important as this is a fast-growing segment where previously we did not have a competitive offering. In the restoratives area, we launched a new curing light, SmartLite Focus, which is a cordless curing light; and also a new universal composite, TPH Spectra, which is offered in both low and high viscosities with a simplified shading system to meet the handling preferences of the clinician.","In prosthetics, we showed the new high strength glass ceramic, CELTRA, and also a millable cobalt chrome product, Crypton, that greatly enhance our offering in the important CAD\/CAM area of dentistry. These products are expected to begin launching in the second and third quarters of this year.","In endodontics, we launched the new rotary NiTi file system, ProTaper NEXT, which is a continuous rotary system that provides versatility, efficiency and safety to the endodontic procedure.","In implants, we are launching a new intraoral welding product called WeldOne that will allow clinicians to connect newly placed implants in the oral cavity to prove initial stability and provide more prosthetic options immediately in the offertory versus what is now, in many cases, a multi-visit process to complete the final prosthetic solution. Of course, there are several other new innovations that we did show in the quarter, but these represent the best example of the innovations we are currently bringing to the market. I look forward to reviewing our new products and business activities in future calls. I would now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.","Christopher T. Clark","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me build on some of Bret's comments and provide a bit of a deeper dive on some of the key income statement elements and also provide some additional color on our balance sheet as well as the cash flow for the quarter.","Our sales growth, excluding precious metals, of 1.1% and flat adjusted earnings per share for the period probably don't provide the best barometer of performance given the calendar comparison. As we look at our business performance compared to the market information available, we believe that our internal growth rate of 1.6% is probably slightly above market growth for the quarter with the impacts of the calendar and the directionally softer European market as well as the specific impact of the implant integration in Germany affecting our results this quarter.","Currency translation was a headwind of approximately 60 basis points on sales for the quarter and it was about 100 basis points worse than our expectations coming into the period. The gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the first quarter was 58.2% of sales, excluding precious metals. That's 190 basis point improvement sequentially, but 130 basis points below our high-water mark of 59.5% in the first quarter of 2012.","Let me put that in perspective. Since the date of the Astra Tech acquisition, we have reported average non-GAAP gross profit margins of 57.7%. So compared with historical averages, this performance is favorable, particularly when you consider the 2 less selling days. However, there are still a couple of important factors that weighed on the results in the quarter. First, we estimate that the medical device excise tax in the United States reduced gross margins by about 40 to 50 basis points compared to prior year. This was obviously not in the baseline from last year and will -- and this will also continue to impact us moving forward, along with the rest of the medical device industry. The other 2 factors impacting quarterly gross profit rate comparison in the prior year are mix and transactional currency. Mix was slightly negative in the quarter primarily due to the disruption from the implant integration activity in Germany, and we believe this should improve sequentially moving forward now that the German integration is in our rearview mirror. With respect to the transactional currency impact, the key negative driver is the impact of the strong Swedish krona compared to the euro and the British pound. While we have some hedges in place to mitigate some of the risk associated with movements in these cross-currency rates, the effect was not fully mitigated in the quarter.","Moving to SG&A expenses. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $283 million or 42.1% of sales, excluding precious metals. Expenses as a percentage of sales were down 50 basis points compared to prior year but were higher than our long-term baseline due to the cost of the biannual IDS show in Germany and also sale seasonality. These impacts were temporary and we expect that we will generate some improvement in these measure as we move through the year. Our expense ratio for the full year last year was 40.5%. We expect to be able to beat that this year.","Adjusted operating margins for the quarter was 16.2% of sales excluding precious metals. That compares to 16.9% in the first quarter the last year. This reflects the gross margin SG&A impacts I've just described, including the medical device tax, which caused 1\/2 to 2\/3 of the change versus prior year. As we move forward, one of our -- one of the key opportunities our new management structure provides us is the ability to focus more strongly on driving leverage and increased effectiveness across our operating units and franchises and to engage our functional organizations in a more integrated fashion. In short, we have the unique opportunity to more thoroughly leverage our size and also the proximity to our customers that our franchise structure provides relative to cost, marketing impact, innovation efforts and manufacturing, among other opportunities. I look forward to working with our global management team to help drive these efforts.","Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 4.5%, and that reflects the number of significant tax adjustments in the period. The operating tax rate was 21.8%, which is 120 basis point improvement compared to the 23% operating rate in the first quarter 2012. This reflects some significant work on the part of our global tax team to minimize future tax impacts and also to allow for efficient repatriation of foreign-generated cash flows. These efforts resulted in approximately $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share in the quarter, and we think that this is going to hold for the year. In addition, adjusted results include a one -- sorry, adjusted results exclude a onetime positive tax impact of approximately $0.08 per share in the quarter, primarily relating to the impacts of the 2012 Taxpayer Relief Act that was enacted in early 2013, including the 2012 R&D tax credit. So to clarify, the benefits of the 2012 act are removed from our adjusted results.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the first quarter was $71.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share. And this compares to $53.3 million or 37% -- $0.37 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. These results included a number of items, which we've listed in the schedules in the press release. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $75.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared to $75.3 million and also $0.52 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. In addition to the items already mentioned, EPS was negatively impacted in the quarter by currency by about $0.02 per share versus the prior year. This more than offset the benefits of the lower tax rate that I mentioned previously. Based on current rates, we estimate the earnings headwind from currency for the year to be between $0.04 and $0.05 per share.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was $36 million, up nicely from $20 million in last year's first quarter. I should note the first quarter is typically our lightest quarter from a cash flow standpoint, so we should see operating cash flow increasing in subsequent quarters.","Inventories increased about 4 days from December in anticipation of our new product launches. Inventory now stands at 110 days and that's flat in terms of days compared to prior year. Accounts receivable days were 59 days at the end of March, and that was up 1 day compared to last March.","Capital expenditures were $24 million in the quarter. And we estimate the capital spending to ramp up during the year to a full year level in the $120 million range. Depreciation in the quarter was $20 million and amortization was $12 million compared to $15 million in the prior year period.","Our net debt-to-capital ratio continues to improve and it stood at 39% at the end of the first quarter. That compares to 45% last March and 39% at the end of December. We anticipate that ratio continuing to gradually improve as we move through the year. I would note that we are approaching our long-term target range of between 35% and 40%.","We see more flexibility to create value through our capital deployment strategies. We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter but still have approximately 14 million shares available for repurchase based on the company's authorization, and we do view a reasonable level of share repurchases as an opportunity as we move through the year.","We're also continuing to be active on the M&A front and are continuing to dialogue and actively set specific opportunities. During the first quarter, we completed one small acquisition and would not be surprised to see more acquisitions as we move through the year.","Finally, as Bret stated, we're revising our 2013 earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.33 to $2.43 on an adjusted basis. This reflects the positive impact of the operating tax rate as well as the currency headwinds, our first quarter results and our assessment of the current dental market conditions. That completes our prepared remarks. We certainly thank you for your support, and we'd now be glad to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions, if I could. Essentially, Bret, if I heard you correctly, it kind of sounds like maybe Europe took one step backwards this quarter, and I thought that inconsistent with what we've heard from other vendors. I'm just sort of curious if you have any sort of anecdotal data points or anything that would put that in a little bit more perspective? Is it just macroeconomic or is there something else that we should be thinking about now that we're also almost into mid-May.  I mean, what have you seen thus far in the second quarter?  Anything worth calling out?","Bret W. Wise","Thanks, Glen. Certainly, Northern Europe differs from country to country but it was slightly weaker this quarter. If I had to talk about specific countries, I'd say France, in particular, seemed to be weaker. Germany seemed to be about the same and, of course, several other countries. But generally, just a slightly weaker Northern Europe. And it wasn't as strong as it had been to allow it to offset weakness in the southern part of Europe. In our guidance -- or the adjustments to our guidance that we made today, we're reflecting that we're not -- we don't see indications that that will turn around as we move through the back half of the year here, although we're encouraged by some recent reports about manufacturing in Germany, for instance, that seem to be rather strong in April. I think it's hard to translate that into the dental market without some specific data points. But from a very high level, Europe just seemed to be a little bit weaker than we had experienced last year.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe if I could just follow up on that, related to margins, you said in the press release that, obviously, the slower revenue growth may have impacted margins to some extent. But you also called out specifically some important investments made by the company during the quarter, which maybe depressed margins a little bit. And I'm not sure if you were referring to what we talked about with respect to Germany and the implant business or if there were some other investments. And I'm trying to get a sense if those investments were kind of onetime or are they going to be ongoing within the cost structure? Any additional details?","Bret W. Wise","Sure. The investments we were referring to, the primary one was the integration in Germany that Jim discussed in more detail. That certainly is a onetime event, and we believe we got that behind us now. It's important to get that done, but it did depress margins somewhat in the quarter. The other investment was the International Dental Show in March. We've made commitments for those expenses far in advance. We kept those commitments. We had a great show at IDS, but we weren't able to -- even though we brought SG&A down by 50 basis points, with lower growth and with the IDS expenses, the fact those expenses were in the plan for the quarter constrained us a little bit about -- towards bringing expenses down further. So those are the 2 primary items.","Operator","For our next question, we'll move to Jeff Johnson at Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bret, wondered if I could just focus on the dental implant business for a second. First, I don't think I heard a U.S. number.  If you didn't give it, maybe even just some qualitative comments around U.S. And then in Germany, hearing especially the January and February impact of taking the sales force out for a few weeks there, wondering if you could maybe talk about March, April, May trends there just -- it sounds like it's bounced back. But the other thing we're hearing in Germany is that the dental implant market itself may have slowed. You had the #2 player there in Germany introduced kind of a lower-priced prepackaged system here recently. Just wondered kind of how you think of the German dental implant market here over the next few quarters?","Bret W. Wise","Okay. I'll try to do that and, Jim, if you have any further insights, you can add them. Our results x Germany were positive for the quarter even though we had 2 less selling days. We view that as a -- certainly compared to the announcements we've seen from other people, we view that as a pretty strong performance. We did take the hit in Germany by taking the reps out of the field early in the quarter. We saw that reflected in our sales per selling day, particularly over the first 2 months of the quarter where there was some recovery late in the quarter of that, and I'm not sure about April, I haven't seen the April numbers yet. But as far as we can tell, this looks like a company-specific event early in the quarter and, to us, doesn't really provide evidence that the market there, in total, has changed in any way. Jim, do you have anything that you would add to that?","James G. Mosch","Yes. Jeff, from a standpoint of Germany, I would say that we don't feel that there was an underlying softness in the market. There was a lot of noise. Obviously, for us, there was some particular noise regarding the integration. But in addition to that, I think the 2 less selling days and the fact that there was an additional week of Easter versus the prior year in Q1, it just created some noise in the market that didn't lead us to believe that there was anything other than that and the overall market was okay. You also asked a question about Camlog's introduction. And obviously, this is a -- this was a pretty big announcement for them at IDS. And from our perspective, we look at this as somewhat of an effort on their part. It's a fairly standard implant system with some fairly standard but limited applications. As you probably know, Camlog is generally priced a little bit below the premium players in the German market, but not at the level of the value players. So from our perspective, and I can't say that we totally understand their strategy, but we believe that this is an effort on their part to retain some of their customers that may be reaching into the value segment and also, obviously, maybe participate in the value segment on some level as well. I think long-term, average sell price stability, I think, could be a challenge, but we don't see this as a direct impact to the premium market in Germany.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, Jim. And Bret, not to push you here, but I don't know if you're being evasive or just not giving us the U.S. number and that's fine, but qualitatively, anything on U.S. specifically? And is it fair to kind of quantify the impact of pulling these guys out in Germany for the few weeks that, maybe $0.02 to $0.03, that's kind of backing into the model, what I'm seeing anyway?","Bret W. Wise","Sorry, Jeff, I forgot that you had asked about the regional assessment. Actually Jim, you probably -- you have those numbers. You're closer to those numbers than I am, why don't you go ahead?","James G. Mosch","Yes, Jeff. One of the things I -- what's interesting about that, we feel that in the U.S. that we grew at or above the market in North America. One of the interesting dynamics for us was that, as I mentioned early on, we went live May 1 last year. And obviously, just from that standpoint, we had some activities leading up to that that kind of clouded the picture in Q1. So it's kind of difficult for us to make a true year-on-year comparison from that perspective. But I would say, overall, we are very pleased with our growth in North America.","Operator","And we'll move next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just looking at the U.S. internal growth, I was wondering if you could share what the impact actually was in the quarter from the med tech tax? I was just wondering -- I know you had commented on this before, but just wondering, were you actually able to fully pass that on to customers in the quarter?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. Rob, it's Chris Clark. What I'll -- we took a price increase in January that included a number of factors, including tax and other items. And when we passed that through, I think, at this point, we do believe that the bulk of that is peaking, consistent with what we've seen in the past.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then I know you mentioned an acquisition in the quarter. I was just wondering if you'd be willing to give any more specifics around what area that acquisition was in. And then it sounds like you are currently evaluating other deals. Maybe even just broadly, being respectful of the competitive landscape, maybe just broadly what product categories you're most interested in? And I guess, in particular, high tech has continued to perform fairly well within dental. Just curious, Bret, if maybe any comments or thoughts about moving further up the value chain within the dental offering?","Bret W. Wise","Okay. First of all, the small acquisition we did in the quarter was a small sales and marketing organization outside the U.S. It's really immaterial. As far as the categories we're looking at, I don't like to get into a lot of specifics there, but certainly, we're looking at acquisitions in the specialty categories, in the consumable categories. Those are probably the highest focus at this point. With respect to high tech, as you know, we're a consumable company and we're very focused on being able to participate in high tech in the consumable categories, meaning, ultimately, our products are what end up in the patient's mouth. And there's a lot of buzz about digital dentistry right now. Digital dentistry is a facilitator for products that end up in the patient's mouth. But ultimately, we see our products as part of that facilitation, not necessarily being the high tech item itself but being what is facilitated to get the dentistry done.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then I -- just quickly, the last one I had, and maybe I missed this. I didn't hear an update on the ortho relaunch. Just wondering, any comments around how you're feeling about the market share regain there?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. We're very much on track relative to our expectations. I think we've commented, I think, on the last call that we thought we'd recover about 1\/3 of the lost market share and I think that we also commented that from thereon out, it's going to be a little bit of a tougher fight, if you will. That said, I think we're very pleased with the progress we had in the first quarter. We've just had the AAO show, which is the largest orthodontic show in the year this past week in Philadelphia. And I would say that we were very pleased with the results from that show as well as the customer sentiment regarding our product line. So we're very happy.","Operator","For our next question, we go to the Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the outlook for the balance of the year. It's easy to understand how there were a number of puts and takes in the quarter that made the quarter a little atypical. I wonder if you could use that context to help us think about the drivers of the earnings acceleration over the balance of the year, given the magnitude, something like -- not 1,000 basis points but quite a bit of EPS growth acceleration over the balance of the year. How do you think about -- or how are you telling us to think about the organic growth profile? Are we back to north of 3% on a consistent basis? And do we see SG&A trend back to, I guess, where The Street had been looking for them? Is that a really simplistic way to think about the model that you would think is appropriate?","Bret W. Wise","Well, I think a couple of things. One, our growth in the first quarter here was 1.6% organic with 2 less selling days. So it's hard to adjust that for the selling days, but certainly it would've been reasonably higher without the 2 less selling days. As we look at our markets around the world, we see the U.S., it seems to be doing fine and consistent with last year. Europe's a little weaker, but some of the issues that we had in the first quarter, including an adverse mix, the implant integration, et cetera, are things that we can overcome going forward on a -- we can likely overcome going forward, but we don't think we can make up for the impact that we had in the first quarter. So I think that's the way we think about it. The plans we had for the year, we think, are intact. We can't quite make up for what happened in the first quarter. We are going to have a little bit more headwind from slower markets in Europe as we move for the year, and we're very focused on expense leverage, as we've commented in our comments today, although I don't want to quantify that at this point. Chris, you got anything to add to that?","Christopher T. Clark","No, I think those are the primary drivers. Agree.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then one more specific question on the implant markets. There's been some disruption in the Japanese market with commentary in the media. It seems like that is starting to reverse. And would you agree with that characterization that the noise is starting to fade? And does that set us up for a better trend over the balance of the year, maybe a rebound over there?","Bret W. Wise","Yes. You're absolutely right. I mean, obviously, last year was very difficult and that impact probably led through most of the year. I think we saw -- I would say we saw a stabilization in the first quarter. There has been some efforts, industry efforts, with the Japanese Dental Association and others to try and quell some of those issues. And we're hopeful that that will improve things. Do we -- would we predict a rebound at this point in time? I don't think I would be that strong quite yet. I think we need to see, probably another quarter of activity before we have a better understanding of what's going on in Japan.","Operator","And for our next question, we'll move to John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on Japan. I think you mentioned that that was the last major market where you need to integrate the implant business. Do you expect Japan, therefore, to be soft in the second quarter similar to what you saw in Germany this quarter?","Bret W. Wise","No, I don't. I think the Japanese integration is not as complex from the standpoint of what we did in Germany. Germany was a very complex integration because that was the former kind of world headquarters for Friadent. So it's a larger organization, we have a lot of moving parts there. Japan, I think also, obviously, it's at the end, so we've got a lot of internal knowledge regarding that integration. And we expect this should go as others. And I think we're well prepared for that. We don't really anticipate any disruption there.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then Chris, in terms of the guidance, can you just clarify, are you assuming that Europe is kind of stable from Q1 levels for the rest of the year or deteriorates further?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. We're basically saying what we're seeing in Europe -- that systemic to Europe would continue through the rest of the year. Obviously, the determinate implant integration we're viewing as a first quarter onetime factor, that is now behind us.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Excellent. And then one last one. I think in the past, your annual price increases have been in the 1% to 2% range. Can -- with the med tech tax, following up on Bob's question, can we assume in the U.S., therefore, it was more like 3% to 4% or maybe a bit lower than that?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. I would characterize our global price increase -- I think we made this comment on the last call as well that typically, globally, we're probably in the 1.5% to 2% range. And I think on the first quarter call, we made the comment that we're going to be north of 2%. I'll stick with that comment, John. Obviously, if you look at it geographically, we'd be a little bit higher in the United States relative to x U.S. more than likely.","Operator","We'll move now to Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe the first question, Bret, just some high level thoughts on the endodontic business. I know you don't really give specific commentary there, but how did that perform? And then I think it was at Chicago Midwinter when Cybron introduced a new reciprocating file.  Can you talk to -- I knew that your sales guys are giving you there that's having at least a revenue impact in the field?","Bret W. Wise","Okay. Jonathan, I'm going to start the response here and then pass it to Jim. The endodontic business is performing very well. We had some key innovations that came out about 1.5 years ago that's very popular in market and growing rapidly. We also introduced some new file system at Chicago and at the IDS, which has gotten rave responses from customers. With respect to the competitive -- the response from the competitor, I'm going to let Jim address that as well as anything else he has to add to what I've said here.","James G. Mosch","Yes. As far as -- from the standpoint of the overall market, I think what you've seen in our endodontic business, really over the last 2 years, is really successive product launches. We made some pretty significant investments in R&D in the endodontic business really going back about 4 or 5 years ago. I would say that we're bearing the fruits of those efforts at this point in time. Those new products have been very well received in the marketplace. And I believe, in many cases, we've been fortunate to really set the standard in the marketplace. As far as the new products are coming onboard, certainly we believe that competitors will attempt to emulate those products. But endodontics is not a one-product category and new products that we've offered, that we've launched in both -- really 3 different filesystems, a new -- got a purchase fill-in systems, irrigation systems and also new motors in apex locators that improved the procedure as well as diagnostics. I mean, I think we're really offering a very updated, innovative, comprehensive solution for the customers. And we believe that we're comfortably positioned in that market versus our competitors.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Perfect. Great, very helpful. And then, Chris, I think this one's for you. You guys are bringing down guidance by about $0.05. I believe you mentioned tax is lower and will be a beneficiary of about $0.01 per quarter. So if you call it sort of lowering by $0.09, is 1\/2 from FX and 1\/2 from ops? That was going to be the first question. And if that's true, in terms of ops, what's really the driver, is it -- seems Europe might be a little bit weaker relative to where you guys were 3 months ago?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, thanks. I'd probably characterize as the following: tax is obviously favorable in the range that you mentioned, basically offset by incremental FX going the other way. And then you're looking at basically about $0.03 in terms of really kind of the first quarter miss, if you will, in terms of the operational side on -- due to softer Europe but as well the German implant integration in that mix, and we're carrying that forward. And then basically carrying forward a little bit additional softness -- or continuing softness, if you will, for Europe. So those would kind of be the building blocks that I would use to think about it.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then very last question. Bret, Europe up 0.8%, but China actually had down consumables year-over-year. So do you think the market softened but you're still confident that you're gaining share over in Europe?","Bret W. Wise","Yes. I think that is pretty clear we are. We've seen -- of course, we've seen all the dental implant companies report. We've seen the largest distributor report. Our numbers are clearly above the average of those numbers and we feel pretty comfortable that the new product introductions and the innovation, such as the innovation that Jim referred to earlier, are driving above market performance for us at this point. Just a moment on the market, I mean, we had been running closer to 2% growth in Europe. This quarter came in a little bit under 1%, although there's that 2 day selling issue, which clouds the picture, but so apples-to-apples, we feel that we're performing about like we were in Europe, although we feel like the markets have weakened just a little bit, just perhaps as we entered 2013.","Operator","We move now to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Bret, could you elaborate on the Rest of World experience in the quarter? It seemed to decelerate a little bit. Were there any unusual channel dynamics?","Bret W. Wise","Yes, let me give you some insights on that. Rest of World was 2.9% for us this year. And again, that's not adjusted for the selling day issue. What we saw this quarter was a very strong growth in the emerging market elements of Rest of World. As I commented, Japan was down, which shouldn't be a surprise to anybody given the reports that we've seen on the implant companies in Japan. And then the other developed markets within our Rest of World category were kind of flat or slow growth or maybe slightly down. So the report here is the result of average -- it's the average of those emerging markets which are growing faster, the developed portions that are growing slower and the impact of the 2 selling days.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And Chris, any chance you could break out the impact of FX on the gross margin line between both translation and transaction?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. I mean, for the year or for the quarter?","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Both, if that's possible.","Christopher T. Clark","Well, the way to think about it is there's a lot going on, Brandon, in the FX line or in the FX rates. Obviously, translation was slightly negative for the quarter. We think that's probably going to be roughly neutral to a little bit positive probably for the year. But transaction is probably the primary challenge, specifically, the lot of interactions between non-US dollar rates given, basically, our business model and business structure. And then also, as Bill mentioned I think on the last call, the impact of our hedging activities, basically we're going to be -- more beneficial or stronger benefits last year compared to this year.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And is there a yin dynamic going on with -- in terms of the revised outlook? And can you explain or just walk us through in terms of how you interact or how you transact with your ortho partner there? What are the thought that might have been a slight positive given your source product?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, it actually helps and hurts. Relative to the sourcing of the orthodontic product, yes, there is. It does certainly -- the movement does help us there. Unfortunately, it also hurts us in terms of the translation impact coming back from our business in Japan. So you got to kind of assume, you can't kind of get away with those 2 factors.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then just what should we be thinking about in terms of operating cash flow for the year? That would be helpful.","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, and again, as we look at it, operating cash flow, we think, should be improving sequentially as we move forward. The first quarter typically is our lighter quarter. And again, our operating cash flow expectations for the year are slightly above what we had last year.","Operator","And our next question is from Yi-Dan Wang with Deutsche Bank.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I have 2 questions, one on implants and the other one on your consumer care business. So on the implant business, I missed the first part of your call, so apologies. Did I get it right that the business was in low to mid single-digit decline, including the negative impact of the 2 fewer selling days?","Bret W. Wise","Yes, implants were down globally low to mid single -- or low to mid single-digits, not correcting for the selling days. And if you take Germany out, it was flat to up, again, not adjusting for the selling days.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then to what extent would you say that business has benefited from the IDS? And also with the U.S. integration down for a few quarters now, what cross-selling benefits are you seeing coming through so far? And what could we see going forward?","Bret W. Wise","Yes. As far as the IDS is concerned, we had a fairly big presence at the IDS. I think this was mainly very much our -- in many ways, our global launch of the new DENTSPLY implants as we have been going through the integration over the last year. It was a good show. Sales were as expected. As you know, something about the IDS consumable sales are not as impactful at the IDS as is equipment sales. I think clinicians definitely go to that show to see the equipment that they can't see in their offices. But it was a good show for us. We're able to launch some new products. And so we were comfortable with what we accomplished at that show. As it relates to the U.S., you're absolutely right. We launched the integration May 1 of last year, and we're now coming up on 1 year anniversary of that. And we've seen some good successes from that. The organization has been fully trained. They're doing well. They're selling the entire portfolio. And we've seen some excellent cross-selling that's come out of that. First of all, it's allowed us to put a little bit more sales resources on the previous DENTSPLY brands, as DENTSPLY was a smaller organization in North America. And from a cross-selling standpoint, it's -- so our Isis bars and bridges, we've fully launched that product. That has now -- you'll able to order that online via the Atlantis WebOrder system, that we've had some excellent uptake in that area. In addition, we have a good portfolio of bone-grafting products in the North American market and the new larger organization is now taking that on and has found that to be successful. And then quite frankly, between the 2 organizations, having a larger organization now selling the Atlantis customized abutments, that has also been an impact. So we're definitely seeing the leverage from the larger organization and the broader portfolio products.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So I mean, it sounds like you should be seeing quite a lot of benefits but from your commentary earlier about your performance in the U.S. relative to your peers, am I right in interpreting that we're still at the very early stages of seeing some of these benefits? And if so, should be a lot more to come?","Bret W. Wise","No, actually my earlier comments indicated that we were performing at the market or better, and that we are quite pleased with our North American business. So we feel that we are beyond the integration and that organization is performing at a good level.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And would you be able to give us just maybe a bit better idea on how much better you are versus the market?","Christopher T. Clark","Well, I mean, the beauty is in the eyes of the beholder here. We're not sure exactly what the market is, but we think the market's somewhere in the mid single-digit range in the U.S., and you should reflect on our comments in comparison to that.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on your constant [ph] care business, would you able to give us how fast that business -- or how that business developed in the quarter and your expectations in the short and also in the midterm with your key competitors being quite active in upgrading the U.S. intermittent capital market and also launching from what we can see to be quite differentiated products?","Bret W. Wise","We're very happy with that medical business that -- I know that you weren't on earlier, but that was in our comments. That business performed as we went through the regional growth rates.  We commented in each region that that was contributor to our growth rate, and we're happy with that. We have some -- we launched in January a new product that we think is pretty innovative and is getting a good uptake there. We've been taking share for the last 18 months in the female market off a new product as well. So we're feeling pretty good about that medical business and the outlook, not only in the U.S., which you're raised, which is a growth market, but outside the U.S. as well.","Operator","Our next questions will come from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just a question here. You mentioned the channel inventories are still a little bit high at the end of the first quarter in the U.S. Just trying to reconcile that.  To me, that would sort of imply maybe that the second quarter sales will still be a touch soft in relation to that.  Then the flipside, you also referenced the tough comparison you had in the U.S. in the first quarter was a 7.4% internal growth, and that comp should get easier in the second quarter. So if we kind of think about the puts and takes of all that, what's our -- I mean how should we be thinking about the second quarter without giving specific guidance, so just kind of reconciling those factors for the upcoming quarter?","Bret W. Wise","So let me kind of work through those one at time. Chris may have an insight because he's pretty close to this. But we did a price increase October 1. And as predicted, the dealers bought ahead of that price increase, and we commented on that at that time. Then as we moved through Q4, we could see the dealers were trying to increase their channel inventories ahead of the January 1 price increase. On our fourth quarter call, we commented we thought that happened. But then that was pretty much confirmed through subsequent announcements by the dealers themselves that they had, in fact, had increased inventories pretty substantially ahead of that January 1 price increase. We did see some of that come down in the first quarter, but certainly not all of it. And the recent announcement by one of the major dealers confirmed this as well, that they seem to have worked off about 1\/3 of that inventory build in the first quarter. So you're right, that still got to come out. I don't know when it will happen, if it will be second quarter, if it will be over several quarters. But that -- we don't believe those inventory levels will stay that high over a very long period of time. With respect to the comparison, we did have a gangbuster January -- or first quarter 2012 in the U.S. 7.4% internal growth and that comparison does ease as we move through the rest of the year. Chris, I don't know if you have anything to add?","Christopher T. Clark","No. Those are the 2 factors. And again, on the channel inventories, they did come down in the quarter, but they still have room to grow yet. So yes, from that angle, I'd view that as a gradual transition, at this point over the next quarter or, frankly, it may be a little bit even in Q3.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Jeff Johnson at Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So Bret, help me reconcile one thing. If I look at your European number, up 0.8%, you had the 2 fewer selling days, you had the German issue. I mean if I ex all that out, I can convince myself maybe 3%, 4%, even 4% or 5% growth in the quarter. Obviously, that doesn't fit with kind of your tone on the European market right now and kind of everything else we've been hearing on Europe. So I don't want to get too positive on the next few quarters, but it also seems like the numbers, optically, were definitely better. And how do I reconcile all that?","Bret W. Wise","Well, I think there's a number of factors there. One is that -- and this number is about a full point lower than we've been running. There are 2 fewer selling days offsetting that. We did have the largest dental show in the world in Europe in the first quarter. So I mean -- and that does generally boost growth, not so much in equipment but it's certainly not negative to equipment. So you should take those comments -- with reason -- the way to reconcile this is we look country-by-country in Europe right now. We see those markets as being -- some of those markets, not all -- from being slightly softer than they were, let's say, 6 months ago or 1 year ago. And I wouldn't take our number and just add 2% or 3% to it for the selling days because there's more factors there, including the trade shows, to consider.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the channel inventory, just a follow-up from the last question. I mean, is your look at channel inventory just a comment Schein made on their call a couple of days ago? Or do you have more of a direct line insight there? Because I think some of their inventory's remaining high on the equipment side, not necessarily the consumables that would impact you. So I'm assuming there's something more than just their public comments that have you kind of talking about that?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. Jeff, we monitor that pretty closely. Obviously, we know we sell to them and we get their sellout data, so that enables us to monitor that pretty carefully and it gets beyond just Schein.","Operator","And Mr. Leckow, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Derek W. Leckow","Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today, and that concludes our conference call. We thank you for your interest in DENTSPLY. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","For opening remarks, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Joshua Zable. Please go ahead, sir.","Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slides 2 and 3 of our earnings slide deck presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Josh. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Also, joining us on the call Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer. And I'm very happy to welcome back Uli Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our second quarter results did not meet our expectations. Ongoing equipment distribution challenges and certain transitory issues impacted performance. Our integration efforts, while necessary to transform our business, have not been fully implemented and are continuing to affect our execution.","Our decision to invest in additional sales and R&D efforts while reducing our earnings in the short term will set us up for faster growth in 2018 and beyond. We are focused on improving performance in the back half of the year, which I will discuss in more detail later.","Second quarter internal sales declined 3.6%, driven by a decline in Technologies. Consumables and Healthcare had internal growth of 2% this quarter. For the second quarter in a row, our Consumables business grew in each of our three regions, but still did not meet our expectations. Technologies declined by approximately 10% internal growth or $47 million. Growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately $19 million or 400 basis points. This came as a result of a quarter-over-quarter changes in net equipment inventory levels at certain distributors.","We sold less equipment into the channel at wholesale and the sell out into the market was significantly less than expected. The transition in our go-to-market strategy is having a larger short-term impact than we anticipated. We expect this will continue to affect results through the third quarter, when we expect expanded distribution to benefit us in September.","Turning to geographies. This quarter, Europe was our fastest growing region with internal growth of 2.3%. Technologies' growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately $2 million or 50 basis points as a result of quarter-over-quarter changes in net equipment inventory.","Despite the record interest in our Technologies at IDS, we did not convert our strong showing into the sales we expected. It is possible that customers delayed purchase decisions, while evaluating new product launches. Over time, we believe the accelerated adoption of technology will benefit Dentsply Sirona as a market leader.","Our IDS leads still may yet generate revenue, which should benefit us. Our lead sharing and cross targeting activities are delivering results. Since the merger, we have put together some of the strongest consecutive quarters in Europe for years. Rest of World was down 1.8% on top of last year's 7.5% growth. Growth was impacted by a $3 million or 120 basis points change in net equipment inventory levels in Canada.","In June, we announced the new three-year distribution agreement with Henry Schein in Canada. This will expand our relationship to include CEREC and Schick. Patterson will continue to be an important and critical partner for us in Canada.","Canada is one of the leading digital markets and highly interested in integrated solutions. We believe that once this transition is complete, we should benefit from our expanded agreement. Our Rest of World region is well-positioned to be a growth driver in the short and long term.","This quarter, we saw a rebound in Asia, particularly Japan, and saw strong growth in Russia. Growth was impacted by Canada and the timing of project business in the Middle East. Our U.S. business declined 11.1% on an internal basis, driven by a larger decline in the Technologies. Growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately $14 million or 380 basis points as a result of net distributor equipment inventory changes related to the transition in our distribution strategy. The inventory reduction was lower than expected due to a lower end-user sell-through. We also sold initial stock to our additional distributor, which partially mitigated the impact this quarter.","In Consumables, the U.S. consumables market is stable with modest growth. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.0458, and the loss was mainly driven by an estimated $1.2 billion impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets. Second quarter adjusted non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.65.","This morning, we lowered our outlook for the year. Our results in the first half of the year have been below expectations. We have reflected this in our lower projections.","I'll now turn the call over to Uli who will review our second quarter financials, and discuss our outlook and the impairment charge in more detail. Uli?","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results.","In the second quarter, our reported revenue decreased $29.3 million to $992.7 million, down 2.9%. Adjusted sales excluding precious metals declined 1% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth declined 3.6% excluding a 260 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions.","By our assessment, overall sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $90 million or 190 basis points as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels at certain distributors in North America and Europe related to our transition in distribution strategy.","Based on the company's estimate, net inventory held by these distributors decreased by approximately $17 million during the current three month period compared to an increase of approximately $2 million in the same three months period in 2016. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 120 basis points.","Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together.","U.S. GAAP gross profit was $544.2 million, up $17.3 million or 3.3% from $526.9 million in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content increased by 300 basis points to 55.4% from 52.4% in the prior year.","As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 340 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merger-related items as compared to 780 basis points last year.","On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 58.8%, down 140 basis points for the quarter.","The majority of the decline is associated with the lower sales levels, particularly of higher margin equipment. Reported SG&A expense which includes R&D was $417.6 million, up $15.5 million or 3.9% versus last year.","This equates to 42.5% of sales excluding precious metals, 250 basis points above prior year. Non-GAAP items including amortization and other merger and business combination-related costs added 60 basis points.","Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $383.7 million or 39% of sales, excluding precious metals, representing an increase of 190 basis points. Approximately, 80 basis points of which were driven by the lower revenues associated with the distributor inventory changes. The single largest driver of the remaining 110 basis points were increased professional service fees.","As a result of updating the estimates and assumptions following the recent changes in circumstances and in connection with the annual impairment test of goodwill, and the preparation of the financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2017, the company determined that the goodwill associated with CAD\/CAM, imaging and treatment center reporting units were impaired. As a result, the company recorded goodwill impairment charge of $1.0929 billion. These reporting units were all within the Technologies segment.","The equipment reporting units' goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by unfavorable changes in estimates and assumptions used to forecast discounted cash flows, including lower forecasted revenues and operating margin rates, which resulted in a lower fair value for these reporting units. The forecasted revenues and operating margin rates were negatively impacted by recent unfavorable developments in the marketplace.","These developments included significantly lower retail sales for the fiscal quarter ended April 2017 reported by the company's exclusive North American equipment distributor in May 2017, significant acceleration of sales declines in the company's quarter ended June 30, 2017, and the execution of new distribution agreements with Patterson Companies, Inc. and Henry Schein, Inc. in May and June 2017.","The company also observed an increase in competition, unfavorable changes in the end-user business model, as well as changes in channels of distribution for the company and its competitors. The estimates of discounted future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rate, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries. Any changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact on the fair value of these reporting units and may result in further impairment.","The goodwill impairment charge is not expected to result in future cash expenditures. The company also assessed the annual impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 30, 2017, which largely consists of acquired tradenames in conjunction with the annual impairment test of goodwill. As a result of the annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the company recorded an impairment charge of $79.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.","The impaired indefinite-lived assets are tradenames and trademarks related to the CAD\/CAM and imaging equipment reporting units. The impairment charge was driven by a decline in forecasted sales. The assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets contain uncertainties and any changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact and result in future impairment.","In conjunction with the impairment test, the company utilized its best estimate of future revenue growth and operating margin rates as of April 30, 2017. These estimates could vary significantly in the future which may result in an impairment charge at that time.","Restructuring and other costs were $81.7 million, up significantly from $3.6 million last year, largely driven by the $79.8 million impairment charge for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In total, GAAP operating loss was $1.05 billion, down from $121.2 million last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, down 330 basis points compared to 23.1% last year.","As we discussed, on an adjusted basis, the gross profit margin rate was down 140 basis points with unfavorable impact from lower equipment sales. In addition to this headwind, adjusted operating margins for the current year were impacted by higher operating expense rates by 190 basis points as discussed a moment ago.","Net interest expense increased by $700,000 in the current quarter compared to the prior year. Other income and expense decreased by $19.3 million as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the change in foreign currency as the prior year period benefited significantly from the effects of Brexit.","For the three months ended June 30, 2017, we recorded a U.S. GAAP income tax benefit of $14.5 million as compared to expense of $17.9 million in the prior year period. The current year period includes net benefits of $25.7 million in discrete items, including $23.5 million related to the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets, as well as $4.2 million of discrete excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation.","On an adjusted basis which, per our policy, excludes the discrete tax items, as well as the tax impact of non-GAAP items, tax as an expense was $29 million this year versus an expense of $54 million last year.","On an annual basis, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 17.5%, resulting in 16.2% for the quarter compared to 23% in the second quarter last year and 20.8% for the full year 2016. Our lower tax rate is a benefit resulting from the complementary tax attributes of the merged companies. Due to U.S. GAAP, net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was a loss of $1.05 billion, down from income of $105.4 million last year.","Second quarter 2017 GAAP EPS was a loss of $4.58 compared to $0.44 diluted GAAP EPS earnings in the prior year. The GAAP EPS loss was mainly driven by a loss of $5.05 as a result of the noncash impairment charges.","Adjusted non-GAAP net income declined 16.7% to $150.7 million. This decline in net income reflects lower revenue largely associated with the transition of our equipment distribution in North America. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.65 compared to $0.76 last year. The $0.11 decline in EPS was mainly driven by the effect of the distributor equipment inventory changes and FX. All other effects offset each other, including benefits in reduction of tax rate, acquisitions and share count, offsetting the decline in our business performance. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release.","I will discuss elements of cash flow statement this quarter highlighting the key drivers. Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $126.1 million. Cash used in investing activities was $150.8 million, of which capital expenditures were $33.7 million for the quarter and $116.6 million related to acquisitions and equity investments. We now expect CapEx for the year to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million. During the quarter, we paid $73.6 million for share repurchases and paid $20.1 million in dividends.","Now, turning to guidance. We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2017. We now expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.65 to $2.75. Our guidance includes the following assumptions. Full-year constant currency growth rates to range from 2.5% to 3.5%. This includes approximately 200 basis points of net benefit from acquisitions, implying internal growth of 0.5% up to 1.5%. This assumes internal growth of 5% to 7% for the second half of the year.","In the second half of the year, we expect channel inventory changes to be similar to last year. With the year-on-year comparison being a slight headwind in the third quarter and a slight help in the fourth quarter. For the last six months of the year, we anticipate essentially flat year-on-year impact from channel inventories overall. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues excluding precious metals of $3.95 billion to $3.99 billion. Our lower outlook reflects about $100 million in lower internal sales growth as compared to our previous assumptions with the largest single driver being our North American equipment business.","We now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 17.5% for the full year. The lower tax rate reflects both, the benefits of the complementary tax attributes of the merged companies, our lower projected income and our particular geographic mix this year. Our EPS range implies a full year diluted share count of approximately 231 million to 233 million shares versus 222 million shares in 2016. This reflects approximately $0.09 headwind from share count. We anticipate FX headwinds of $0.10 to $0.12 for 2017.","Based on the dynamics I've explained, we believe that the fourth quarter should be our fastest growing quarter in the year.","I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Uli, for your detailed explanations. As you all know, the entire management team and I take guidance very seriously. We expected the first half of the year to be challenging, but it has been more difficult than anticipated.","We are taking the necessary actions to address our performance. We expect improvement in the back half of the year. We believe the issues that have impacted us this year are transitory in nature. I'd like to walk you through them and help you understand why I believe we will exit the year with momentum going into 2018.","This year, we have been impacted by the transition of expanding distribution of equipment in North America. As you know, we expected a headwind to our growth for the planned inventory reduction with distributors. While we expected some reaction from the market, we did not expect it to this extent. Doctors are waiting for distribution to open to evaluate their options.","This is stalling decision-making and freezing the market for our high-tech equipment. At the same time, Patterson, our exclusive partner, is going through a number of changes themselves. They're enlarging their product portfolio and they are still coping with the effects of their sales force reduction last summer.","Patterson has stated publicly that they are committed to reinvesting in additional sales and marketing resources. This is expected to help drive adoption of technologies in the marketplace which would directly benefit us. Our lower-than-expected retail performance of high-tech equipment in North America accounts for a significant portion of our lowered outlook. We believe that this should ease in September when our expanded distribution starts.","We expect this to be a catalyst for doctors to resume normal purchasing activities. We are also expecting a record turnout at Dentsply Sirona World in the middle of September. As awareness and interest grows from multiple distributors, we would expect growth to accelerate.","Our Rest of World region should be well-positioned to be a growth driver for us. We saw sequential improvement this quarter, but year-to-date delays in projects and extensive country integration activities have weighed on results. We continue to expect to grow in this region, but are less optimistic with our forecast given what we've seen to-date. We expect to have the majority of our country formation activities completed in this region by year-end, allowing for complete focus on the business again.","As I look ahead, I am confident in a bright future for Dentsply Sirona. The majority of our businesses are growing today. The ones that are dragging us down are having an oversized impact on our results. We believe this will turn in the second half. Our first half earnings have been depressed by lower sales of high-margin equipment and higher expense levels. Our decision to invest in long-term growth drivers like R&D, sales and clinical education more than offsetting G&A savings.","In the back half of the year, we expect earnings growth as high-tech equipment returns to growth and investments made begin to deliver returns. In addition, we are taking the necessary actions to improve our operating performance and reducing costs.","Our transformation is founded on multiple pillars that will drive faster sales and earnings growth. These have been guiding principles for me through my 17 years of dental, and I will be relentless in pursuing them to unlock the value of our organization. First, we have not and will not sacrifice commitment to being the innovator in the industry. We will continue to introduce new products and solutions unique to Dentsply Sirona. These new products will benefit us for years to come.","Second, we will always act with uncompromising integrity, but we will compete with unbridled enthusiasm. Our industry has taken notice of our ability to deliver solutions and is aggressively advertising their own. We will aggressively highlight the features and benefits of our systems, products, and solutions to grow faster than market.","Third, I will hold our organization accountable for our commitments. When I started my career in dental, I was tasked with a turnaround. At Sirona, I was asked to make a great company even better. At Dentsply Sirona, we are dealing with our biggest challenge today, our integration and alignment. As we head into the third year of our plan, we will go from integration to transformation and reap the benefits of all of our hard work.","I've always believed in the power of our team working together to accomplish something great, and our vision is clear. We are focused on improving growth through delivering innovative dental solutions to improve oral health worldwide.","We have over 600,000 dental professionals around the globe using our products daily and yet we have less than 20% share of the market. Our priority is to improve growth and ensuring that our synergies drop to the bottom line in the back half of the year, exiting the year with momentum going into 2018.","Our comparisons are much easier in the second half of the year. You'll recall last year, we grew much faster in the first half of the year than the second half. In September, we believe we'll begin to benefit from the expanded distribution in both the U.S. and Canada later this quarter. This should reenergize sales of our high-tech equipment.","In the U.S., our consumables retail sellout is growing faster than our results this quarter. This should drive accelerating demand of our consumables.","The new products and solutions introduced at IDS will continue to roll out globally. Top line growth remains at the forefront of our priorities and strategies, but we also remain committed to driving leverage through our P&L and driving increased profitability.","In the second half of the year, we expect adjusted EPS to grow double digits, translating into over $600 million in adjusted net income for the year. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our strategy continues to be return capital to our shareholders as well as pursuing strategic acquisitions.","I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona. I want to thank our distribution partners around the globe, who have helped deliver our unique solutions to the marketplace. I also want to thank our employees and investors. We are executing on a three-year plan, which requires hard work and patience. I am confident that we will create significant value for all of you as we change dentistry for the better. Thank you.","We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question today from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Good morning.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Uli, I got to start with you. In terms of the guidance for the year. Just so I \u2013 I think I understand your comments correctly. So, you now anticipate the inventory drawdown on a net basis to be flat for the year versus the prior $50 million to $60 million view. Is that correct?","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","No. This is not correct. Our view for the full year has not changed much. I mean, we told you I think on the first call we had this year in February that we would expect about a $50 million drawdown for the full year. And then when we talked again in \u2013 after the Q1 call, I think, we said we would expect for the remainder of the year, after the events in Q1 another $10 million to $20 million drawdown.","And now, we still see the full year drawdown somewhere in the range of $40 million to $50 million, maybe a little bit lower, at the lower end of this $40 million to $50 million. But this means, after we've gotten down $19 million in Q2, that there is less to go for the remainder of the year.","So, the net impact is probably for Q2 to Q4 altogether about $10 million what we see now versus the $10 million to $20 million we told you before. And for the full year, maybe closer to $40 million rather than the $50 million. But again, these are estimates that we make, and said we build into our forecast and assumptions. And it includes our assumption of a lower sell-through basically which we have observed mostly in Q2 now.","So, the reductions in the channel have not gone as fast as we had anticipated before.","And we do think that maybe they will not go quite as deep this year as we had previously anticipated. But that could change if our dealers have a good event in Vegas, right? With our DS World. They could draw down more. So, this is just our assumption. But it hasn't changed much, Brandon, versus what we told you from the beginning, it's this $10 million swing. Does that help?","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Understood. Yeah. That's very helpful. Then one for you, Jeff. Curious if you're making any changes internally with the management team, would be curious to hear how turnover has been, if there's been any other significant changes on the executive team or elsewhere. And, for example Derek Leckow has been a fixture on the Dentsply calls for 20 years, where did he go now?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. We are making changes on the team. We're also simplifying the business. Derek is actually working with our integration management office and supporting that, which is very important to our organization specifically, but I'm absolutely committed to simplifying our organization.","We've created a chief commercial officer. We've looked at ways of empowering our teams better. We're also setting up our organization into three segments. From a standpoint of turnover, look, we're setting high expectations. People understand that, but I do not see it from a standpoint of our senior team to-date a significant change other than the ones that we've announced to you, and we fully expect to put a premium on leadership and execution as we move forward.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Brandon.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Jeff, I want to start with the impairment. I'm trying to understand why the longer term forecast related to CAD\/CAM and other Sirona product lines are moving lower here if these issues are really transitory. So, has anything meaningfully changed in your forecast for market demand and\/or competitive dynamics?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","First of all, and I'd also like to make sure Uli is able to comment. But you have to understand, Tycho, we haven't broken out which segments have been affected in the order of magnitude of that. Certainly, the aspect of what's going on in North America has had impact on CAD\/CAM in the short term, and you know that the models are affected by the time value of that.","We've also mentioned about competition, and specifically, we've seen a higher interest in digital impression only. This can be transitory in nature as we fundamentally believe that our integrated chair side solution is where we're going in the future. I do believe that we have chosen the right strategy for our go-to-market. Uli?","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, the \u2013 the fact that we \u2013 I can't really say much more than what is said in my prepared remarks. We do these tests on a quarterly basis. We did our annual test this time. We considered all the recent changes that happened over the last weeks and months in our marketplace, and we do these assessments based on our best assessment, best knowledge and belief; as of today, what we see and what we know today and we have incorporated all of these in this assessment. Some of these aspects might turn out to be transitory in nature, and we have made our adjustments and assessments on how we think things would evolve. Some of them are maybe a bit more permanent. So, we've considered all this to the best of our knowledge and belief. And I don't think, this is \u2013 I think, this is all I can say at this point.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Tycho, the other thing I want to really highlight is the guidance that we lowered today also reflects 5% to 7% growth in the back half of the year, which we think is pretty good. However, given our first half results, the implications on the full year are clear.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, for the follow-up, just sticking with the equipment theme, you called out the lack of an IDS tailwind. I'm just kind of curious on that dynamic. Has the kind of post-IDS perception to opening up CEREC not lived up to your own expectations and are there things maybe you would look to do differently to maybe offset some of these competitive pressures that you're flagging?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well \u2013 and, Chris, I'm going to hand this over to you in a second, I would say a couple of things from the standpoint of IDS. Our early indications were pretty clear that it was an extraordinary IDS for us given the traffic and the interest. And, frankly, when we compare it to last year \u2013 sorry, 2015, the vouchers and interest we received were double-digit more than in the past. However, the conversion ratio has been down, and we don't know if it's going to stay lower or this is just slower. And this could track to as much as $10 million lighter, which is not insignificant. But the power of what we were able to show at the IDS from a standpoint of Dentsply Sirona was strong.","The issue of opening up our CEREC certainly hasn't paid the dividends that we thought it might, which tells us there's something about the ecosystem we have, but Chris, please you can talk a little bit about our CAD\/CAM in competition?","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Tycho, I guess, I would just echo Jeff's thoughts in the context or comments in the context that obviously relatively to full chairside CAD\/CAM, the CEREC system is extremely well-positioned. There are some new options there competitively, folks may be taking a little bit of time to compare that.","We do believe that, as they do that and they carefully consider the options, frankly, we believe we've got a significant advantage on a number of fronts, and we think we'll win more than our fair share here. Relative to digital impression, that obviously, the Omnicam, with the addition of CEREC open, is extremely well positioned we believe in that market. There's obviously some training, if you will, for our people, as well as for our distributor partners in the context of education of DI really as a distinct segment, if you will. And obviously, if someone has the opportunity to sell all the way up to a full chairside system, they're going to try to do that.","So, I think that more than anything else, for us, it's balancing, if you will, these two distinct segments through our sales organization, also through distributors. But I do think, we're well positioned \u2013 very well-positioned in both.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","The only other thing I would say is keep in mind the number of these competitive products have not launched yet. So, it's going to be very interesting, and I believe we'll get our fair share as we go head to head against these products, and not just marketing material.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff and Uli. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Good morning, Steven.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just \u2013 let's drill a little bit deeper on the U.S. internal sales decline. It is helpful that you called out the $14 million destocking, but then you also cited that lower equipment sales to end users as a result of the transition challenges of what have been your exclusive distributor. That's the part I want to drill down on for a moment. And I guess you're likely referring to that distributor's U.S. salesforce transition.","I'm just trying to figure out how you kind of assess what's really going on there with that salesforce transition issue versus the possibility that it might just be a general U.S. dental market slowdown, which I think you're saying that you don't see it as far as a general slowdown. But how do we really better understand what's really going on with this \"transition\" challenge at your exclusive distributor separate from the destocking $14 million that you called out?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Right. So, I mean, in general, the dental market we see is stable. We're not ready to call out a real improvement to that and feel good about what we're doing on the consumable side and know we can do more together with that. But as you look at what's going on this year for us in North America, certainly reducing the inventory has been a priority.","The \u2013 we are absolutely convinced that having less sales people out there in the marketplace does have an effect on your ability to sell our breadth of products. And while we are fully committed to our partners in North America, we recognize that with the announcement of a new distribution model that dentists are waiting to see what happens to pricing and offering on that, and what certain distributors may use as bundles on that.","We think the offerings we have on all of our technologies are compelling, and there's no reason to wait on that. But as you heard, we would have expected a stronger sales in this quarter. If we thought that we were not going to have that, we would have taken different actions.","And so as we look at that, Steve, it's clear to us that there is a strong interest in our Dentsply Sirona World by both distributors. We're going to have record attendance and prospects there. And the proof again for all of this being transitory is our ability to execute at a high level. And I'm confident in what we have in store at Dentsply Sirona World and the training that our organization is doing with our distributors, and the fact that we are also adding additional resources to complement our distributors in the back half of the year, and you'll see more of that, frankly, play out in the fourth quarter.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful color. Then just a quick one-liner follow-up just on the U.S. dental consumables growth. I mean, is there any chance that you actually have a number for us and the internal dental consumables growth in the U.S. just for the quarter? I think that became a bit more topical after some of the other dental company earnings this quarter. If you get any sort of number around that, it might be useful.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure. That is a fair point, and would love to get Chris involved.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we saw very similar to what we saw in previous quarters on a days-adjusted basis. Actually, in terms of sell-through, look very, very similar. So, we've not seen it as a trend up or a trend down per se. I'd put it in the low-single-digit range.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. I'm curious how confident you are in kind of the distributor buy-in, as well as destock embedded in your guidance at this point. I guess, how much should we think of this as a more of a moving target? Just curious if we should anticipate meaningful changes at all or do you think that you have better visibility now?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, I would tell you we always give our best estimate of where it is based on the dynamics. But, Uli, if you want to give a little bit more color.","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","I mean, it is a bit of a wild card, Erin, at the moment. We see Patterson's performance, and I think anybody who listened to their earnings call in May sees that it's not really stellar with our products, right? And that's what we're seeing at the moment.","There is a lot of excitement, I think, on the Henry Schein side. I think, they also expressed it on their call the other day. And as Jeff said, registration for DS World is at a very high level. So, this is good. But it still needs to be executed. I think, Patterson has to improve their performance versus where they are now. And then...","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Uli, I just want to clarify...","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","... (47:45) to execute, right?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Patterson is absolutely committed to Dentsply Sirona and the proposition that we bring to the dental office. They're doing an extraordinary job to get ready for Dentsply Sirona World as well. So, both organizations are going to be bringing a lot of prospects, and I think, it's going to be a record event. And, of course, for Dentsply Sirona to succeed and go where we want to be, we want both of our distributors to do extraordinarily well.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. And then, in Rest of World, you mentioned some stronger consumables trend. Can you point to maybe where there may have been pockets of growth across specific geographies that you point to? Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","You're talking consumables, Erin or...","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Consumables. Yes.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Consumables. Yeah. Chris, do you want to?","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, as we look to the Rest of the World, we were stronger in the quarter in Japan than we had been. So, I think that we felt better about that. As we looked at Latin America, we've got some restructuring efforts going on there, but we were pleased generally with the growth we saw coming through there. I think, we've got a number of countries where we're bringing the organizations together. So, we got a fair amount of, I would say, organizational noise in many of these regions that we're working through. But I would say, again, on the consumable side, we felt pretty good. We felt particularly good as well in Russia. So, Russia actually also look very, very strong in that region.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. I guess just to go back. I feel like it's still a little bit of mixed messaging, Jeff, on the Sirona portfolio and your expectations. On the one hand, you are taking this impairment charge, and if I'm hearing you guys correctly it sounds like that's more of a permanent change to the growth expectations around some of the products within the Sirona portfolio.","But then on the other hand, you're saying when distribution opens up, you feel like growth can return to more normal levels and that maybe it's more of an execution issue. So, just hoping maybe you could square those things a little bit better for us. Is it in fact more of a permanent change to the outlook or is this something you see as kind of fixable as we get through the back half?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Look, the \u2013 we took the best information that we had when updating our \u2013 look at our goodwill. And Uli, I think, did a terrific job talking about all of those aspects of it. So, this is as we see it today, and our job as a management team is to make sure our organization executes at the highest level. And of course, we, being the innovator, is a big deal for that and how the acceptance of our new products and what we're able to do. And, of course, we take that into consideration as well.","You don't have a situation after you have an impairment to then change that to reflect what happens years from now on this. And so, we as an executive team took everything into consideration that we've outlined to the best of our ability.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then I guess just looking at the guidance reduction for the year, when we adjust for the changes in FX and tax, it looks like about half of the change might be coming from the change in revenue if I'm thinking about that close to correct. Is there any change to your underlying expectations for margins in the back half in the revised guidance or is it just maybe more delevering on the lower volume? Just curious if anything had changed around the margin side and maybe synergy expectations.","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","There is no big change versus our previous assumptions or views on the second half in terms of margins. If you look at the guidance we gave, I think I said in the prepared remarks that internal growth for the full year is about $100 million lower than what we assumed when we talked to you last time, and the lion's share of this $100 million reduction is in the Technologies segment. As you know, the Technologies segment has fairly high profit margins for us. Within the Technologies segment, the single biggest driver is North America and the CAD\/CAM and imaging product lines, so they have an impact. And if you do the math on this, you will see that the $100 million, it's not hard to see a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact from this $20 million lower revenues. And then you have some offsets from the updated tax rate we mentioned before. And a few other items as cost savings we're implementing in things like this.","So, this is how you get to the \u2013 at the end $0.15 lower guidance at the midpoint.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks, Uli. Thanks for that bridge. I appreciate it.","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","You're welcome.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Take care, Bob.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Miksic with UBS.","Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Vik Chopra in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to get an update on your synergy targets. Can you give us an ideas as to where you are year-to-date, and what we should expect for the back half of the year and heading into 2018? Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Vik. Look, we're still confident that we're uniquely positioned to drive these synergies. I think, it's important that you understand that it's a three-year plan that we have. And we've got revenue synergies, some 150 of these in action. And they are absolutely gaining traction from the standpoint of CEREC, consumables to what we've been able to do with the Midwest, with our electric made in Germany. By the way, Midwest is the number one brand for instruments here, and what we're doing with our implants and X-ray. These are absolutely having an impact, but you also have to take into consideration that we're also investing for the future that \u2013 and that has offset a effect for us.","But I think these synergies also come at the cost sometimes of our base business as we run to look for certain bundles. In the end, it's going to be all about the way we go to market as Dentsply Sirona. So, I believe, we're uniquely positioned there in the integration.","And the cost synergies, the country formations we're in the thick of it, and we're doing all the right things. We are lowering our G&A, but as we said, there's offset to that from selling and R&D. But keep in mind we have significant tax synergies that we've discussed that are having an impact and will continue to.","Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. And just one more follow-up. You called out Europe as being your fastest-growing region this year, any additional color on that, specifically country-wise or by region? Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure. First of all, I think, it's important to talk about Germany. And while Germany had very strong growth, much stronger than GDP plus or minus, we had higher expectations. And I think I talked a little bit earlier about $10 million that we thought that would be there, but strong growth there.","Southern Europe is certainly showing us better growth than Northern Europe. It continues to be a mixed bag. I have to point out that the UK is feeling some real effects and we saw declines there. We've mentioned Brexit before, we're seeing some of the effect to that. France was down a bit for us.","But, in general, very pleased to see what we're doing with Consumables and also what synergies we're able to leverage in Europe. And as I said, that the Consumables were growing the fastest they have in years, which is a great sign for our organization. I'm very pleased with the team.","I think we lose sight some of the time though. We have 16,000 employees at Dentsply Sirona. And certainly, a significant number in Europe who get up every day trying to make a difference, and I'm proud of what they've been able to do with a lot of the uncertainty in Europe. And really power through that and go after making a difference for dental practitioners in Europe and patients.","Vik? Take the next question then.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and good morning. I'll limit myself to two. So, first one, Jeff, just maybe in the context of a lowered guidance in conjunction with the impairment, maybe you can provide just some high-level thoughts on your belief that this entity is a real, call it, mid-single-digit long-term grower once you get this organization where you wanted and you get the right distribution in place, and then I got to a follow-up. Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Let's start with my confidence in Dentsply Sirona and what we're able to do. And it begins with highlighting the fact that every day some 600,000-plus dental professionals use our products. And we are working hard to come up and continue to innovate and that is a principle that will not change. We have exceptional group of people throughout our organization. And talent matters to this and we're holding ourselves to a high standard.","But, Jon, I have to tell you the first half did not meet where we expect it to go, and the second half, we're talking about this mid-single-digit growth, 5% to 7%, with being able to leverage that to double-digit growth.","Our organization knows the expectations that we have and what the investors have for us. And the majority of our businesses are growing, but when you have a challenge in North America and you have what we believe we'll be able to work through in issues with CAD\/CAM and imaging that have strong gross profit profiles, this creates the headwinds for us.","But we're fortunate to be in an extraordinary industry with exceptional customers, suppliers, and partners in distribution. And I do not see any reason when Dentsply Sirona operates together, united, there's nothing that can stop us from reaching our objectives. Integrations are challenging especially when you bring two organizations that are leaders together. And we're in the thick of the integration and I've always said that it's about what we're able to do during this period to transform ourselves after we come out of this to make the most of what we're capable of.","And that's why we've made it clear, it's a three-year plan, and it's back-end loaded. And we're not backing away from that, and that's why I'm doing everything I can to simplify the organization, to bring clarity to our messages, to hold the team accountable, and to make sure that we have the processes and plans in place to make this clear so we can execute on our objectives.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. Very helpful. Very helpful. And then maybe, a little bit near term or even the new internal growth rate of 1% at the midpoint versus the prior of 3.5%, so it seems like, Uli, the net inventory impact for the year did not really change too much, maybe only the timing. So, I just want to be perfectly clear here. Really, the lowering of the internal for the year that is vast majority specific to the retail performance of North American technology, and maybe a little bit that falls to Rest of World and\/or Consumables? Thanks, guys.","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","You got it right, Jon. Right. This inventory is even as we said maybe a little bit positive (1:02:50) lower, $10 million less. So, the $100 million reduction in internal growth, the biggest part is in the Technologies segment. There is only a little contribution from Consumables. Within Technologies segment, the biggest driver is equipment in North America. You got it right, Jon.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Question for Chris actually. Can you just clarify \u2013 I think earlier on the call, there was some suggestion that maybe the underlying dental market had softened a little bit particularly in the U.S., but then a few minutes ago, it seemed like you were saying stable, so just what are you saying for sort of end-market dynamics or are they getting a little worse or not?","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. John, on the Consumables side, we have not seen a softening in terms of sell-through. So, no, I wouldn't say that we've seen any material change on a days adjusted basis in terms of sell-through that would indicate the change in the market. We see it very constant at this point.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","John, I think, you got to go with the word stable. Now, would we like that to be improving? Yes, we can't say it at this point.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. And, Jeff, a quick follow-up for you. You said you're committed to innovation. Can you just expand a bit on that? Stepping back, where do you see the biggest opportunities for real kind of breakthrough, kind of wow-factor product launches over the next few years?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, for those at Danaher and other places, look, we've got a lot of the big bets that we've \u2013 a company can decide to back away from the big bets, and we could make our short-term earnings look terrific. That's not what this company is about, it's about bringing out the best products and solutions. And also understanding that you need to be able to act with the intentions of understanding your markets and different market expectations.","And I think when we talk about our dental solutions, we're talking about root to crown, we're talking about the power of what we can do with our imaging and our CAD\/CAM. But the R&D, none of these products are six-month products. They have long legs to them.","I'm so pleased that we're spending a lot of time with our folks in prosthetics because that's the backbone of our materials, and they don't get a lot of credit. It shows up in restorative or you hear about it in CEREC materials, but they're doing some things that are going to be groundbreaking for us.","In Ortho, MTM is at a small level, but we all know we're the empower of clear aligners. We also know what we have from an install base of our CEREC and our Ortho, and our innovations with regard to software. Remember, embedded in this company is a technology company, an equipment company, consumable company, and a software company. And each one of those has opportunities to grow.","But I will tell you this, John, and I think, this is the takeaway. Not all of our R&D projects are big bets, and we are making it crystal clear that we are going to fund some areas more than others, and that's the important distinction.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I want to come back to the topic that Jon Block raised. I think it's really the key that we're trying to get to here is how do we walk away from this conversation with a view that the growth goes back to mid-single-digit growth? You've come at that from a number of different directions. But I fear that one of the things people are going to come away asking is, well, what over the last six months or nine months, has changed in the way the company thinks about commercial strategy? We've been hearing for some time that there's an anticipated evolution in the commercial strategy. I think, we all understand what's going on with Schein moving in the right direction. Patterson they have their own issues.","But I have to think that you guys have learned a lot over the last six months to nine months, and you've refined your approach. And so, as we try to build our confidence in the 2018 outlook, it would be great to hear you reflect through, Jeff and Chris, how you think about addressing the market and what is really new after the experience of the last three quarters?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, I think, Steve, let's start and be crystal clear. We're talking about dealing with the realities of what's happened in our second quarter, and reflecting that because that's also where we looked at our impairment. Keep in mind that we signed our new exclusive agreements with Patterson and Schein, May 8. And also, we've also looked at what's transpired in the business in North America. And certainly, we've done our best to highlight the implications of when you're exclusive and you have less sales reps out there, what has happened. We would have expected April and during our exclusive period to have higher sales than we were able to. We talked about the end users there.","And then, when you talk about the mid-level growth, again, I'll tell you back half of the year implies 5% to 7% growth. And we've said in our remarks that this is creating momentum into 2018. I understand and I'm very sympathetic to the desire for us to give 2018 guidance today. But we don't give long-term guidance. We've said on multiple occasions that we're fundamentally committed to growing faster than the market that has not changed in our belief. And fundamentally as the CEO, that's my job to bring that out.","And Chris, and Uli and our management team is committed to that. So, I understand the desire, we're not at this point, changing our guidance to give 2018 in August. But I hear you and appreciate that. Chris, would you like to give some additional points?","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","I think, you hit it well, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of factors here. We've discussed those. We've got all the integration going on. There's a lot of effort in a lot of places here. This organization is coming together in terms of good collaboration in the field, that's a positive. But there's obviously a focus cost in the near term in terms of some opportunity costs on this business focused through that. And again, I think, the other factors have generally been discussed.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So, then my one follow-up, and it's another sort of commercial and channel strategy question, is if we exclude Patterson, if we exclude Henry Schein, and we look at the rest of the distribution network globally for Dentsply Sirona, how has market share evolved for you over the last two quarters? Then I'll get back in queue. Thanks.","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","I don't think we have the data. (01:11:50) I mean, we have so many distributors worldwide. It's really hard to gather. And once you leave the Patterson and Schein, the size gets fairly small fairly quickly, right? So, at least, on a global basis, they tend to be more national or at best regional dealers. And we don't have the data at hand, Steve. I can't tell you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","But I am confident that with our talented sales and service organization, and nobody does clinical education better than we do. So, I would be very \u2013 and we do it on a global level all of this. Nobody has more reps than we do selling this or focused on clinical education and training. So, I would believe that that would play even a bigger role outside of Patterson and Henry Schein.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review.","David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. When we look at the...","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Good morning.","David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review","Ciao. As dentists are waiting for the distribution changes, is that going to be completely delayed or is there going to be like a kinked fire hose response where you'll see a rush all of a sudden, do you think, or are these just missed out on altogether until things get up and going again?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","I don't think it's missed out at all. I think that the compelling reason that dentists choose to go chairside to do digital dentistry is actually just becoming a bigger importance to them. All of the market research we see and that is published out there is that when they look at what are the most important purchases for them, the number is increasing. But there is an old saying that if I can wait a few months to save real money, am I willing to do that. And we're seeing that dentists are doing that. And let's not forget there are a lot of great relationships that dentists have with Patterson and with Schein. And so, is this bigger than we would have expected, of course, it is and that's why we've said that. But what gives all of us a lot of confidence is the record interest in DS World and that's not just in the attendees, that's the number of prospects who are going there specifically to change their practice for the better.","David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review","Thank you. And then, earlier you've commented that, united, the company is essentially unstoppable and that just makes me want to question, are you seeing any integration hiccups that you'd like to call out as far as things that have been unforeseen and\/or maybe impeding results on that side?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","What I would say is an integration of this magnitude always has its ups and growing pains. We're asking this organization to be able to operate in a matrix. We're in the midst of the integration and these are big integrations that we're talking about.","Do I feel good about the individuals we've chosen to be country managers? Absolutely. Do I feel good about the individuals running our SBUs? You bet. We've got a talented team. But \u2013 and collaboration is a critical component, so is leadership. And that takes time to be able to do this and, frankly, this disruption in North America as we figured out our go-to-market plays a role in all of our 11 SBUs, right? And I could spend the next five hours going through each one of these to talk about it, but I am absolutely confident in our ability to get this done. But we will make changes, there's no \u2013 and we have made changes.","David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review","All right. Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Operator","We'll take our final question today from Jason Bednar with Robert Baird.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, all. Jeff, I just wanted to come back to the topic that's been asked here in some prior questions, and really just ask in a very direct way. Is there any way you can provide what you're assuming Sirona specific growth rates are now today versus, say, one year to two years ago? Has that long-term growth fallen from 8% to 6%, or 8% to 4%? And we're just looking for something a little more concrete in the magnitude of the growth reset? And then, I just have one more follow-up.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","I appreciate the desire to have that. We've taken in everything into account when we came to the conclusion that we have \u2013 just like we're not going to break out the guidance going forward for any one of our SBUs individually. We're not going to do that here. What I would tell you is that CAD\/CAM is a much smaller part of our totality and so is imaging, and so is treatment centers, which we've talked about at the \u2013 our part of the impairment.","But what you should focus on really is the guidance we gave today and the fact that 7% in the back half. And this is \u2013 a critical driver for this is our Technologies, which means CAD\/CAM and imaging playing an important role. And by the way, treatment centers has had a very strong year for us.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Understood. And then just to come back to some of international equipment comments. I'm pretty sure there might be a pause in European markets because of \u2013 from the competition right now. But can you comment on what you're assuming for conversion rates in Europe for the back half of the year? I apologize if missed that earlier, but especially some of those competitive systems are not yet available, just if you're assuming any change in the conversion rate you saw coming out of IDS.","And then, we also saw some weakness just in Schein's Australia business, there \u2013 there Australian equipment business yesterday. Just I know it's not a huge market for you, but just wondering if you've seen similar softness.","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay. Look with regard to the conversion from the IDS, we mentioned that we felt that that translated to about $10 million less than we had assumed in our last guidance, right. And the way we measure this, Jason, is people can hand in these vouchers until 90 days after the show, and then we kind of drop off and we do not count it as a sale at the show anymore, and people do not get special pricing on it, but that doesn't mean that some of them might buy later. But we've built a little bit of this expectation into our guidance, but it's not too much, right.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","I think, we can effectively say we're not assuming it. So, it would be a upside.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Slovin, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you very much for joining us on our second quarter call. I know there was a lot to digest in this call. And appreciate the questions that we had from the analysts. I want to tell you that Dentsply Sirona is committed to executing on our back half, and I look forward to updating you on that on our third quarter call, and so does our management team and our 16,000 around the globe to making our back half as strong as we discussed in our guidance today.

[Operator Instructions]","And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Sweeney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Sweeney","Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I'd like to remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to this call are available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on our earnings press release. During today's call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer, Dentsply Sirona.","Donald Casey","Thanks, John, and thank all of you for joining us on our earnings call.","As you can see from our materials, we had a solid third quarter. Our results show that we are making progress against our restructuring plan, as measured by both our financial results, as well as important executional milestones.","Looking at the financial highlights from the quarter, internal growth reached 7.5%, above our expectations and higher than anticipated Primescan shipments and improved consumable sales. A combination of solid sales growth and continued operating discipline contributed to a 510 basis points expansion in our operating income margin versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57, up 51% versus year ago. Operating cash flow was strong at $159 million, up 27% versus the prior year.","In addition to the financial performance, we saw progress in many important areas. We had a robust product launch program in the third quarter. The organization launched new loyalty program as part of our overhaul of the promotional strategy and we saw progress in multiple countries in building out our sales force effectiveness program.","On the corporate governance front, we announced the appointment of Janet Vergis to our Board of Directors. So overall, while we understand there is a lot to be done, the third quarter shows continued progress and gives us reason to be optimistic about our future.","I will now hand the presentation over to Jorge to review our financial results.","Jorge Gomez","Thank you, Don.","Before I dive into the details of our performance, I'd like to take a moment to express how excited I am to join Dentsply Sirona. We are well positioned in a very attractive and evolving space in healthcare. The commitment of the Board of Directors and approximately 15,000 associates around the globe to use our scale and capabilities to enable growth is very clear to me. We have tremendous products, integrated solutions and a great commitment to innovation. These are all key ingredients to pursue and deliver sustainable growth.","Turning to Q3 non-GAAP results on Slide 8. We are pleased with the early results stemming from our restructuring plan. It is clearly demonstrated in our solid third quarter performance, with strong sales growth, considerable margin expansion and substantial improvements in EPS and operating cash flow.","Third quarter sales of $951 million were up 2.9% versus last year. When on internal growth basis, sales increased 7.5% driven by strong growth in technologies and equipment and improved performance in our consumables business.","Third quarter revenues came in ahead of expectations, a function of solid execution by our teams who delivered more Primescan units than expected. In addition, consumable sales were higher than anticipated, partially due to timing of orders and shipments. Currency was a revenue headwind of approximately 2% in the quarter, mainly due to the strengthening of the US dollar relative to the euro.","Gross profit was $548 million or 57.6% of sales, up 219 basis points as compared to the prior year. More than 50% of the gross profit margin improvement was driven by our efficiency and portfolio shaping initiatives. Favorable pricing and positive FX accounted for most of the remainder of improvement.","Total SG&A of $376 million was 4.1% better than prior year. SG&A as a percent of sales improved 290 basis points to 39.5%. Our teams continue to do a great job executing on operational and portfolio initiatives, and these efforts accounted for the majority of the margin expansion.","Operating income increased 43% to $172 million in the quarter. Operating income margin of 18.1% expanded 510 basis points versus last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.75%. And third quarter EPS was $0.57, up 51% year-over-year.","Moving to segment performance on Slide 9. The Consumables segment accounted for 44% of our sales. In the third quarter, consumable sales were $416 million, up 1% and up 3.2% on an internal sales growth basis. This performance was driven by growth in restorative and endodontic products, offsetting part by declines in our laboratory products business. As you may recall, last year's consumables performance was impacted by disruptions at our Venlo distribution facility in Europe.","As Don said, we are changing our promotional strategies. As a result of this shift, we are expecting uneven growth in our consumables sales over the short term. An example of the types of changes we are making is our One DS loyalty program, which was launched in September.","This program rewards dentists for purchasing Dentsply Sirona consumables, both through our distribution partners and directly from us. While it is early in the execution of this program, we are encouraged by the results. One DS is an excellent example of how we are executing on two key operating principles, owning our own demand creation and approaching the customer as one Dentsply Sirona.","In the third quarter, Consumables' operating margin was 27.3%, an increase of 250 basis points as compared to prior year, mainly driven by efficiency initiatives and positive pricing trends.","On Slide 10, we highlight our Technologies & Equipment segment, which accounted for 56% of sales. Third quarter T&E sales were $535 million, up 4.5% versus prior year, representing a strong 11% growth on an internal basis. Key drivers of this growth were Digital Dentistry, which includes the CAD\/CAM and Orthodontic businesses and Healthcare, offset in part by Equipment & Instruments performance, mainly a function of the ongoing competitive pressures in our Imaging business.","Growth in Digital Dentistry was strong, a result of the successful Primescan lunch. In the third quarter, we had higher-than-anticipated manufacturing production of Primescan. We continue to work hard to manufacture enough units to satisfy the robust demand, which is partially fueled by the recently announced upgrade program in the US.","In October, we announced that previous generation CEREC owners in the US market an upgrade to Primescan with an attractive discounts. All our US digital impression system owners can also take advantage of the Primescan upgrade offer. We expect the upgrade program to add to our overall sales performance and anticipate that it will be accretive to our overall financial results.","Technologies & Equipment operating income margin was 19.6%, up 1,020 basis points as compared to the prior year. About half of this improvement was due to higher sales growth fueled by Primescan and the high level of dealer destocking last year. The remaining margin expansion was driven by our efficiency and portfolio shaping initiatives.","On Slide 11, we present our business performance on a regional basis. US sales of $336 million increased 1.5% compared to the prior year and increased 4.6% on an internal sales growth basis. We experienced solid growth in our Technologies & Equipment sales driven by Primescan and the impact of dealer inventory destocking in the prior year. US consumable sales declined in the quarter, but improved as compared to the second quarter.","European sales were $352 million, up 2.7% compared to the prior year, and up 8.4% on an internal sales growth basis. The European sales increase was driven by Primescan. Consumable sales saw a solid increase versus last year. However, please remember that we experienced shipping disruptions at our Venlo European distribution facility in the third quarter of 2018.","Rest of the world sales were $263 million, up 5.1% compared to the prior year, and up 10% on an internal growth basis. T&E growth was mainly driven by Primescan sales as we started shipping to some countries that had not previously received regulatory approval. Consumable sales were slightly positive in this region.","Moving on to Slide 12. We generated a strong operating cash flow of $159 million in the quarter. We are increasing our focus on making our operations more capital efficient, and we are continuing to work on improving our cash conversion cycle. Free cash flow was $136 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $23 million.","During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares for a total of $100 million repurchase under our outstanding authorization. In addition, we paid $20 million in dividends, resulting in a total of $120 million returned to shareholders during the third quarter.","Including share repurchases and dividends, we have returned to shareholders over 50% of the operating cash flow generated year-to-date, while sufficiently funding our key initiatives. Capital allocation is a priority for me and Dentsply Sirona. We will continue to follow a disciplined and prudent approach to assessing specific capital deployment options for the corporation.","Our first priority will remain investing in the business to make sure our restructuring is successful and to enable sustainable growth. We have a dividend which consistently rewards our shareholders.","We will be opportunistic about share repurchases as we were in the last quarter. Disciplined portfolio management is of high importance to us. Over time, we intend to optimize our portfolio by shedding underperforming assets and adding capabilities to drive sustainable growth for Dentsply Sirona.","Moving to Slide 13 where I will share our expectations for the rest of the year. We are pleased to deliver Q3 results that exceeded our original expectations. And importantly, we are seeing our performance improvement initiatives gain traction. As a result, we are updating key elements of our expectations for 2019.","We now anticipate internal sales growth for the full year to be toward the - at the upper end of the guidance range of 4% to 5%. We are also increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance from the previous range of $2.35 to $2.45 to the new range of $2.42 to $2.48.","Regarding our long-term financial metrics and aspirations on Slide 14, let me make a few comments. On the one-year anniversary of the announcement of the restructuring, I'm pleased to say that we are making substantial progress toward achieving these objectives. Our products and commercial initiatives are gaining traction and we believe will enable sustainable internal sales growth in the 3% to 4% range.","By the end of 2019, we expect to have completed approximately $85 million of cost savings and we remain on track to deliver the full $200 million to $225 million in savings by 2021. To achieve these savings, we expect about $180 million of restructuring charges, about $110 million of which will be cash.","We have made good progress in improving margins with adjusted operating income margin up 290 basis points year-to-date, and our cash flow and liquidity continue to improve. As a new member of the team. I'm committed to the achievement of these goals.","We have to use the scale of our assets and innovation capabilities to deliver returns in alignment with these aspirations. Our approach to executing this plan will remain structured, decisive and mindful of the right investments required to drive long-term growth.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don.","Donald Casey","Thanks Jorge.","It's great to have you part of our team. I wanted to provide some additional perspective on our restructuring and build off some of the areas highlighted by Jorge. On Slide 16, you can see the outline of our November 2018 restructuring, which was focused on the priorities of revenue growth, margin improvement and organization simplification.","The key priority has always been driving revenue growth. To deliver that, our plans have been built around accelerating new products, improving demand creation and driving clinical education. In terms of new products, the biggest change we've made has been moving to a portfolio approach across our R&D projects. This process forces focus on which projects can generate the largest impact on the entire company and take full advantage of our unique portfolio.","Moving now to Slide 17. It is clear that our strategy is beginning to work, as evidenced by the step change in new product launches that we are seeing in 2019. We continue to see strong momentum from our Primescan launch as we introduce it into new regions around the world. Primescan is the gold standard in the dental scanning technology area. It is more accurate, faster, easier to use and it integrates seamlessly into dental practitioners' workflows.","We also launched CEREC 5.1 software, which represents a performance upgrade for CEREC. The addition of OraCheck allows the dentist to visualize 3-dimensional changes from virtual optical scans over time on their own computer creating a valuable new diagnostic tool.","Now looking at Slide 18, where we highlight some of our third-quarter US product launches. We introduced the Astra Tech EV implant system, which was developed to provide excellent stability for improved outcomes in any type of bond. This implant system works well in either delayed or immediate load cases. In the Imaging space, we launched a new Schick sensor, one that generates excellent image quality even at lower X-rays doses.","In addition, our Imaging business will benefit from the US launch of new versions of the Orthophos, E, S and SL panoramic imaging lines. The TruNatomy Endodontic Files system is an important new product in the Endo area. And finally, we officially launched our partnership with Carbon for the 3D printing of digital dentures.","In all, it was a strong third quarter performance from our R&D team and we expect that momentum to continue. In order to realize the full value of our innovations, it is critical that we have a world-class commercial engine.","This has been an area of focus for Dentsply Sirona over the past year. The charge here has been simple, how do we improve our demand creation process? In the third quarter, there has been a lot of activity that demonstrates the breadth of this initiative.","Moving on to Slide 19. As Jorge mentioned, the third quarter saw the launch of an important new loyalty program named One DS. For the very first time, we are rewarding customers for their purchases across the entire Dentsply Sirona line. This highlights the shift we've been making in our promotional program.","We are more focused on building relationships with dentists, delivering clinically relevant products, arming our salesforce with impactful tools that advantage us in the marketplace, and at the same time, give strong incentive to dentists to try our new products.","We have just passed the 6-month mark of putting our salesforce effectiveness program in place in the US. So far, the results have been encouraging. Based on what we've learned, we will be rolling our salesforce effectiveness program to additional countries around the world over the next few quarters.","Moving on to Slide 20. Another example of improving our demand creation activity DS World. This is a program unique to Dentsply Sirona. And this year, we brought together over 7,000 dental professionals for a full program of continuing education and practice management improvement classes. It is unlike any other event in the industry and helps position Dentsply Sirona positively in the eyes of the dentists.","This year, we saw a major step-up in attendance, which is important given that DS World is a dynamic product launch platform. At DS World, our revamped salesforce capabilities were on full display.","Our salesforce now utilizes a common CRM system that allows us to talk to the customer in a single voice. Our newly deployed clinical development managers engage our high-priority customers from a single point of contact and now with a single loyalty program.","Moving to Slide 21. In addition to revenue growth, the second priority of the restructuring was improving our margins. We've taken a number of steps here including portfolio management focusing on fixed cost reductions and taking a disciplined approach to spending.","Our simplified organization structure now includes a centralized supply chain function, centralized procurement and other ways we can take advantage of our scale. These efforts help drive the 510-basis point improvement in OI margins this quarter.","I would also note at this point we have now exceeded the headcount target outlined in the restructuring plan of 15,000 to 15,300 for the past two quarters. Jorge and I would like to acknowledge and thank the entire Dentsply Sirona team for all their excellent work. With all of these initiatives, we are mindful of the need to create consistent and sustainable improvement.","The management team recognizes that we have a lot of work in front of us, but as we look at our pipeline going forward, the progress we've - been - made in improving our innovation process, our commercial effectiveness and our simplified organization, we have good reason to be optimistic about the future.","With that, I would like to thank all of you for joining us today and we will now move on to questions. John?","John Sweeney","Operator, we'd like to open it for questions at this point in time. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Tycho Peterson","I'd like to start with consumables, a little bit more than we had modeled in the quarter. I know you're talking about the DS loyalty program. Can you talk a little bit about how you think that flowing through the next couple of quarters, obviously you have a tough consumables comp in the fourth quarter, and I think the implied ramp is still about 4.5%. So how do we get comfortable with that step-up against the tougher comp in the midst of kind of rolling out thIS DS loyalty program for consumables?","Donald Casey","Yes, Tycho, thanks for the question. Look, we've said a couple of times that we think the consumable progress is going to be a little bit uneven over the next couple of quarters, and it's really the result of the change in the promotional program and One DS in our mind is a great example of what we're trying to do. We had a very successful launch of that program in the US at DS World, we exceeded the number of dentists we thought that would sign up for it and the results we've been seeing from the dentists that have signed up has been very, very encouraging.","So, again, we see the underlying activity that we're putting in place as something that is, once we get through some of the promotional short-term choppiness is going to drive demand for our products.","The second thing I would - and Tycho, you know this, obviously our Resto business and our Endo businesses are big, strong and important business for us, and we feel pretty good that we now have some innovation lined up, which has been lacking in those two particular areas over the last couple of years, I mean, if you look at the Resto business with Surefil one, Palodent 360, we're feeling pretty good about that.","We've had a very good reaction to TruNatomy which is really the first new theory of how you should be managing root canals in a while, and in our KOLs and as we've rolled that out, we've seen positive response. So look, I think our formula is, we've got to innovate at a faster clip than we have in the past, we are feeling very good about our clinical education programs.","And the final issue is, we have changed our promotional programming and things like One DS which is off to a very good start, are things that we believe will allow us to deliver sustainable growth over the next year. In terms of the specific fourth quarter comp, we recognize that and we've taken that into account with the guidance that Jorge provided.","Tycho Peterson","And on the innovation front, no mention of SureSmile on the new product slide, just curious why that was omitted and how you're feeling about that rollout?","Donald Casey","We're feeling great about SureSmile. It's interesting, you know, in retrospect, when we put all the material together, we said we should have said something about SureSmile. I would just say, first, we've been trying to focus the communication here on what were the macro drivers for the entire company, and well, we're feeling very good about SureSmile and believe it's making significant progress. It's not big enough to drive the entire company.","So we didn't include it as a company driver, but SureSmile is right on track against the plan we had put out for it. We are increasingly optimistic based on what we saw at DS World and the reception that the CERC doctors had to it and we think it's clearly a growth driver for the future. Just right now, it's not big enough to drive the entire company.","Tycho Peterson","And if I could ask one last quick one. Your equipment numbers were good. We heard from your biggest peer about slowdown in developed markets on the equipment side, it doesn't seem like you've seen anything. Is that fair to say? And can you comment on October at all?","Donald Casey","Sure Tycho. Let's divide some of that up. I mean, obviously, we're very happy with what's going on with Primescan and we continue to be gratified with the reception that's had in the marketplace. In Jorge's prepared remarks, he also mentioned, though, that we've seen some continuing challenges in the Imaging space whether that's from competitive or pricing pressure, it's certainly been an area of focus for us.","We feel that we missed the wide field of view, innovation, and basically, what we're talking about right now with the new Schick sensor, we finally got the Orthopos line, which gives us a much more competitive lineup available in the US.","And one thing that we're starting to really trying to understand is do dentists look at their capital spending in kind of a bucket? So if they're going to go buy CAD\/CAM, are they going to be a little softer across other parts of the lines? So overall, we're extremely happy with our Technology & Equipment line, and again, that's led by Primescan, but there are some things that we got to work on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your question please.","Jeff Johnson","Don, I wanted to follow up on your consumables comment, I think in the answer to Tycho there, you talk about sustainable growth in consumables kind of heading into next year. I just want to push on that a little bit. I mean, obviously you've got the Venlo noise from third and fourth quarter here and will get past that. But as you get into next year, it sounds like you do still feel confident regardless kind of market maybe being flattish on the consumables side that you guys can grow above that.","And then in, I know, we recently wrote, we kind of talked about some big growth rates we are hearing about in your DS World accounts those dentists who have signed up your loyalty accounts. Are you seeing kind of sustained big growth in those accounts and is that one of the drivers? And then how to think about consumables growing for you next year, even if the market doesn't a whole lot?","Donald Casey","Yes, thanks, Jeff. Let me - there were a couple of questions in there. Let me make sure I answer them. So do we think that given the innovation, clinical education and the promotional programs we're putting behind our consumable business, once we clear the Venlo noise and some of the promotional shifting? Yes, we think that we should be able to grow at the levels that we've talked about in our restructuring, which is long term we think consumables can be at 2% to 3%, and look, every day, I come to work trying to improve on that. That's the first part of the question.","The second part was, what are we seeing with One DS? First, we were very, very happy with the response rate. We got to dentists signing up at DS World, which is really when we launched the program. Second, we've been really gratified by the support that our partners have put behind it and they're recognizing that as an opportunity to create volume there.","So again, we're getting good expansion of the One DS program. The results were kind of a month in, we've been very, very encouraged and I know you were at DS World, and if you were able to talk to some of the dentists as well as some of the US folks that have really focused on this program, we believe it is a long-term driver for us.","The only, I think, Jeff, I'd say, and I don't want to diminish the importance of this, if you go back and look at our consumable business and we get a lot of questions about what do you think the base consumable level of growth is, and things immediately kind of focus on channel dynamics, I go a little bit further upstream and sit there and say, OK, when is the last substantive Endo launch that we've had in our space? And it's been a while. If you look at our Resto business, which I think is a well-run business for us, but we really hadn't seen a big launch in close to 18 months.","So again, if we can up the cycle of real innovation that's going to provide benefits to the dentists whether it's time saving or better clinical outcomes, that's we think is really, really important to us and I'm starting to feel a lot better about the pipeline that we have in our consumables space.","Jeff Johnson","And maybe a quick follow-up question just for Jorge or maybe Don for you just on the - about I guess it's what, a $125 million in cost savings remaining over the next two years to get to that $200 million to $225 million number by 2021. Those cost savings are going to be helpful to the model. Can you help us understand kind of some of the offsets to or potential offsets to those though, it sounds like maybe R&D investments you do want to sustainably take a little bit higher, it would seem like you're ahead of the headcount reduction count that you've talked about in the past, but I think there could be some people and maybe infrastructure investments going back into some other markets over time, obviously pricing hasn't been overly helpful on the imaging side or some other parts of the market. So just how do we think of the offsets to those cost savings or can those cost savings flow straight through to the bottom line?","Jorge Gomez","Jeff, this is, Jorge. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're trying to balance all the priorities that we have as a company. And so that include we have aspirations and targets for margin expansion. So a lot of those savings will absolutely help get us there. In order to get to those margins, we also need to drive the top line, and we need to make sure that we invest in innovation.","So you made the point about R&D. We are extremely focused on R&D, and Don just talked about our pipeline in the consumables. So some of those savings will be reinvested in developing or propelling our top line.","There is also other things that we will be doing that will be used to fund our investments that not necessarily come from these savings. We have - we are improving our disciplined from a commercial standpoint in terms of how we use our promotional dollars. We're paying a lot of attention to pricing right now.","That's one area where, for example, we just hired, we recruited a Global Head of Pricing, and we are going to be able to benefit from the work in that space and those type of benefits will be reinvested in the business and some of that will flow through the bottom line. So it's going to be a combination, it's going to be a balanced approach trying to hit all the targets that we have in mind.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your question please.","Brandon Couillard","Don, just curious how you're feeling about the implant franchise. Could you speak to the growth in the third quarter. And then just how differentiated the new Astra EV implant is and whether that's available globally now?","Donald Casey","Yes, thanks, Brandon. Personally, I would like to avoid putting any implants in my own mouth, but you asked more generally, I think. Look, our implant business is one that we're focused on, it's big, it's profitable. It's basically been holding serve, it's up a little bit, down a little bit over the last couple of quarters.","We think we have to do a better job on our implants, because if you look at what the category is doing, it's clear that we are losing share by just basically posting de minimis growth. We've done a number of things to really, in my opinion, begin to focus on how do we grow that business. We mentioned last call that we put a new leadership team in, one of our best people, and this team is making real progress.","We're starting to treat all our four brands as well as our MIS value brand as part of the portfolio and being very thoughtful about how we look at that. We've really combined R&D efforts and we have a very clear path over the next couple of years in terms of how we need to not only evolve to keep up with the category but get back to the point where we are the innovator in the category, which is where Ankylos and Astra came from.","In terms of our EV system, we feel it is outstanding and we wouldn't have launched it unless we feel that it's got a competitive advantage. We have been missing an immediate load screw. We think our design is novel and clinically differentiated. The feedback we've been getting from our KOLs has been very, very strong, and again, the reaction when we finally deliver real news is like, Jeez, we've really kind of been waiting for an immediate load screw, we've got that.","But in my mind, implants is more than that. I think we have an opportunity, if you look at our Atlantis franchise, which is a custom abutment. If you look at the fact that we've just really started expanding our MIS value brand around the globe.","We continue to think we've got a lot of runway there, but I would sum it up by saying implants is not tracking with the category, over the last three or four quarters, it's kind of been neutral. There has been a quarter where it might be up a percent, down a percent, but it's really in my mind critical that we at least begin to hold share and then look to expand beyond there. So I would put this franchise in the needs improvement area.","Brandon Couillard","And question for you, Jorge. Just first, can you spike out the impact of currency on gross and operating margins in the third quarter? And then do you have an update for us in terms of CapEx for the full year?","Jorge Gomez","Sure. On currency, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, on the top line, FX was a significant headwind, was just over 2%. The majority of that impact came from the euro and a lot of that dropped down to the gross margin. Obviously, within gross margins are elements in terms of costs that some - offset some of the negative headwind. But net-net, from a top line perspective, it was pretty negative, mostly the euro.","With respect to capital expenditures, in the quarter, we had about $23 million of investment. We continue to improve the rigor that we are applying to the approval of projects and we have a very, very good process internally. We are investing in the areas that are aligned with the priorities of the company and that has resulted in a little bit of a lower number this quarter. But over time, we believe that we will be funding all the capital requirements that we need.","And we are in the process of putting together the budget for next year, and next time we talk next quarter, we have a pretty good perspective for what I think should be kind of the organic rate of investment in capital expenditures, of course, that's going to be driven by what the project yields are in the next month or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your question please.","Michael Cherny","Thanks so much for taking the question. I want to dive back a little bit, it's just into the overall consumables franchise. I know there's been some comp effects. You mentioned some of the Venlo dynamics. That being said, you had talked about the promotional changes last quarter, I guess, aside from the One DS program, was there anything else that either had hit you last quarter, that got better than you had expected. My understanding is that some of the promotional changes would take a little bit longer to lined out than you would have thought. And then obviously with One DS, the sign-ups being great at DS World, just curious to get an understanding of timing and some of the other factors that may have drove to that outperformance on consumables?","Donald Casey","Thanks for the question. Look, we did better in consumables this quarter than we thought. And obviously, there is the Venlo noise that goes through this which you identified. I would just tell you, I still think we're a quarter or two away from understanding exactly what the promotional impact change is going to be.","And look, we're happy with the third quarter, our guidance obviously reflects what we think we're going to do in the fourth, but it's going to take us a couple of quarters, because this is - we've been pursuing one kind of promotional programming for 25 years and we're in the process of changing that.","But I would tell you, the one - the profound changes in the US in addition to finally giving the salesforce the news it needs with really good clinical innovation, we went through a pretty significant salesforce effectiveness program, we introduced this new concept of clinical development managers, a common CRM platform, and now we've introduced the loyalty program. And the loyalty program, the response has been really strong. You know, to be honest, we've exceeded what we expected.","In terms of number of sign-ups, it's exceeded what we thought in terms of the impact on the customer behavior since leaving DS. I mean, we can obviously see exactly what they're doing and we're very, very encouraged by it. The fact that our dealer partners have really jumped on this as a way of expanding demand, we continue to think we're going to sign things up. Do I think it's going to be immediate shot in the arm in the fourth quarter? Probably hard to measure.","But again, I think we just want to say we're trying to do the right things for the consumable business to provide that 2% to 3% growth that we indicated in our long term, which is innovation, clinical education and improving our demand, and our demand creation activities, whether it's things like One DS or salesforce effectiveness program, we feel is going to get us to where we need to be in consumables.","And look, I'd - we're - again we're trying to be as transparent as we can, those things are going to be a little bumpy. And this was a positive bump. But look, I'll tell you if you're sitting in my chair and you look at the portfolio of products we have, we recognize absolutely how important having consumables grow is and we're committed to the program that we need to see that as something that we are driving consistent growth on a sustainable basis over time.","Michael Cherny","And maybe just to dive on a little bit further into one of the comments you made regarding the interaction with the dealer partners that you have here. As you think about the pathway forward for growing some of these directly some of this CRM management, some of these loyalty programs, what are you hoping that your dealers do differently to change their strategy, their performance, their responsibilities with you? And I guess along the same lines, will at some point get to an area where the customer is essentially deciding, do I place that order through the dealer versus I place that order directly through the promotional strategy? I guess how does that play out over time?","Donald Casey","So we get asked this question indirectly in the number of different ways. Here is kind of how we view this. First, our dealer partners have been terrific about One DS. They look at the same way we do as a great way to accelerate trial of our critical innovations and it also has a wonderful opportunity to tie in equipment and consumables in a unique way, and as a result, we're all interested in selling more. So that's been terrific.","In terms of - let's remember, we have a direct and we have an indirect part of our business, our Ortho implants, Endo businesses, our direct businesses, which we have always had direct relationships with the dentists. On the consumables side, prevention, lab, Endo - excuse me, prevention lab and those businesses are traditional consumable businesses and we're going to continue running through the dealers.","I mean, they provide, we've said this a number of times, really great service in terms of, they help to do demand creation, they run order to cash, they manage extremely complex logistic business, and they are terrific partners.","So our aim and how we look at things is, hey, we're supposed to come up with great innovation and we're supposed to help educate the dentists clinically and we're supposed to create as much demand for our products as we can and we work with our dealers to help spur that demand further and they provide a incredibly important part of our value chain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Your question please.","Elizabeth Anderson","And as you think about moving into the second phase, so to speak, or 2020 in terms of cost cutting, are you seeing the sort of the opportunity set there change? Is it sort of as you expected? I mean, I know you sort of commented quantitatively, but I'm looking more like qualitatively across your experience in the business.","Jorge Gomez","This is Jorge. Yes, we have made, I would say, during the first phase of the restructuring from a cost take-out perspective, we've made significant progress. And as I indicated, we are going to achieve approximately $85 million this year. We have - we are following an extremely detail and rigorous process to identify opportunities to put initiatives in place and to track those and we have a very healthy pipeline of projects and opportunities that have been already identified, and that to your point, will require more work and a little bit of a more sophisticated type of planning and restructuring of the business. We put in place our pillar structure a few months ago, we are trying to have horizontal processes across the corporation, and we are seeing the early benefits from that.","So one example of a key area for us, that is yielding benefits now, but is going to probably provide a lot more benefits in the future based on the work we're doing now, is global supply chain. That is one massive part of our business, that is now being handled in a more global way and that's going to yield significant benefits in the future.","Similarly, for other end-to-end processes across the company, order to cash, corporate infrastructure, those are changes that require more time, but we have identified already where the opportunities lie and we are going after those, and all of those things combined will yield the incremental $120 million or so to get to the $200 million to $225 million target for the year.","So there is a lot of work to do, but I - one thing that was actually a very nice surprise for me when I came aboard a few months ago was to see how the structured and disciplined that process is, and so that gives me a lot of confidence that we are going to be able to, over time, and during the time period - during the period that we have indicated to achieve those savings.","There is things around portfolio shaping that we have already accomplished. But there are probably some other things that we can do there. So there is a healthy pipeline of opportunities and they have been identified and we are in the process of launching a lot of them.","Elizabeth Anderson","And as you think about your improvement as you pointed out, in the operating cash flow and the free cash flow going forward, does that change how you think about capital deployment going forward?","Jorge Gomez","I don't think so. I think in terms of how we deploy our capital, I think the general principles that I indicated in my prepared remarks will remain. I think the good news is, we should be able to, in the future, we should be able to generate more cash flow to reinvest more in the business and to deploy capital in a balanced way.","So I don't think generating more cash is going to substantially materially change how we think about capital allocation. I think the good news is, there will be - if we implement, if we execute on the projects that we have in mind from a capital efficiency perspective, there will be more, more and more cash available to reinvest in the business and to return to shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Your question please.","Courtney Owens","This is Courtney Owens on for John this morning. So one more consumables question. We've seen from other industry participants that have reported this quarter a disparity between consumables performance on a regional basis and I think that you guys pointed to that too in your prepared remarks and - but we do recognize that I guess you guys had a benefit from the disruption in Europe last year, but I guess when you're thinking about kind of like the end-market dynamics, what would you say the different dynamics are that are driving the varying performance in each of the markets as it relates to consumables? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks Courtney. I would tell you, you know, a lot of the consumable conversation invariably winds up boiling down to what's going on into the US retail market, we always want to step back, we do a tremendous business globally. And if you look at what we would consider our growth areas and we've highlighted the importance of the developing world for us, we're seeing good growth there.","I mean if you look at the rest of world growth rate on an internal basis was 10% this quarter, and some of that was prime, but some of that's the consumable side, so we tend to look at the right now Europe and the US are kind of 1% plus growers and the rest of the world is whether that's Latin America, whether that's Middle East, whether that's Asia Pac, is growing significantly faster than that.","So on an end -market basis, we continue to be comfortable that the consumable businesses, again, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, there might be some variation, but we continue to believe that's a 2 percenter over time on a global basis, 2% to 3% is kind of what we target that on when we think about our strategic planning horizon. That's how we think about the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Your question please.","Trevor Brown","This is Trevor on for Jon. Thanks for the questions. I have first one on CAD\/CAM. Can you talk about ultimate conversions of past upgrade cycles such as Blue and Omni and kind of comparatively, what are your initial thoughts about Omni to Prime so far?","Donald Casey","It's interesting. So obviously when we come out with a launch like this, we go back to Blue, we go back to Omni, and I would tell you, right now, there's two things that are different with Prime that were - makes us pretty optimistic. I mean, the first is, we went out the gate and we were really focusing on new users. How do we sell more people on share side, and really help them transform their practice and help their patients out?","And we - at this point, we feel - obviously Blue was a little bit earlier in the cycle, but we feel in terms of attracting new users, Prime has been a benefit to us versus what we might have seen in past launches, Part 1, Part 2. Where are we in the cycle? We did not do an upgrade as early on this cycle as we did in other cycles.","Some of that, and I realize memory sometimes get short, but one of the things we had actually done, we had worked hard to accelerate the Primescan launch from when it was originally planned. And as a result, we have been really pushing our supply chain team and Bensheim, and Dan Key, our Global Supply Chain leader has been really all over this.","We took a little bit of a risk accelerating the program, how many of these would we have? And the team has been able to over-deliver. So we did not do a upgrade as early as we had in other launch cycles, particularly in Omni, and right now, we've just done it in the US, which is different than how we've done that in other times.","So, so far Prime is outperforming what we saw with Omni as much as we can look back and see that eight years ago.","Trevor Brown","And then maybe on regulatory in the rest of the world, how are approvals looking for Primescan and what else needs to get done at this point?","Donald Casey","Primescan, we feel pretty good about it. We mentioned that in our prepared remarks, we are able to run it out into Korea, Japan, and basically right now, we are either approved or about to get approved in most major areas there, China is one that we still haven't gotten approval for, that's going to take us a little while.","There is a couple of isolated countries, but by the beginning of the, I would say, September time period, where we were - had approval in most, if you think about our top 20 markets, there is one or two exceptions, but we've been pretty much approved around the world. You know, now, stuff, Jon, when we launch CEREC 5.1 with OraCheck, the device is approved, sometimes the software might take a second or two longer so. But basically Primescan - the Primescan acquisition unit camera have now been approved in most places.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Your question please.","Jonathan Young","This is Jonathan Young on for Steve. Just going back to Primescan, I recall that there were some bottlenecks that you had in the manufacturing of Primescan. Is this essentially cleared at this point given the outperformance in the quarter? And I guess, in terms of pipeline that you've seen in the quarter thus far, are you seeing more coming from new users in the quarter or is it more related to the upgrade program? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Jonathan. I'll take this one. Again, we've been very, very happy with demand for Primescan and the reaction we saw at DS World was quite frankly better than we thought. So what that means is, right now, we're selling - we are delivering every unit of Primescan that we can make, we might have outstripped our manufacturing capacity right now, but is all that means is, it's a week or two delay in getting the product. We do expect that to catch up sometime in the first quarter, but again, the reaction to Prime has been really, really gratifying.","And again, I can't thank the team in Bensheim and our global supply chain leaders enough because they're - they got us more product earlier than we thought, and in the third quarter, they over delivered. We're optimistic that they will catch up to complete demand by the first quarter, but it doesn't mean that we're missing opportunities. It just means dentists who are excited about this product may get it a little bit later than they thought.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yi Chen from HC Wainwright. Your question please.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on for Yi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a simple question on Danaher spin-out Envista and I wanted to see if you have any comments about - have the market dynamics changed in any way for Dentsply Sirona and does that affect the company restructuring if at all?","Donald Casey","You know, Envista is out there, they've been around for a while. They were just a division of Danaher. The fact that they are public doesn't change their competitive profile. We think they're good competitors, and Amir and the team has done a great job, but they've been around. It's a fact of our competitive landscape and has been forever. So thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your question please.","Jason Rodgers","Yes, just looking over some of the details of the DS program, it looks like dentists who sign up will get a greater discount on consumables if they purchase before year-end as well as become eligible for rebates and other discounts over the next two years. Do you think sign-ups and purchases before year-end to get that higher discount will be significant enough to boost the consumable growth in the fourth quarter and potentially pull forward demand from the first and the second quarters of next year?","Donald Casey","First, thank you for the question. We've tried to be consistent saying consumables is going to be up and down, and over time, we're putting programs in place, the innovation and everything else to drive consistent growth.","The One DS program, we think it's going to have a positive impact on the fourth quarter, and to be honest, we think it's going to have a positive impact on the first and second quarter because it's not as if there is not incentives for them to keep buying, if you actually peel the One DS program, there is clearly a opportunity to get a discount based on their 2019 behavior - purchasing behavior. But there is also a pretty significant rebate that comes into 2020. So we were looking to create sustainable relationships with these dentists and not create a promotional spike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks, and sorry, I had to hop on late, but can you give us an update on the broader DSO strategy and then also within the DSO strategy, kind of Primescan into DSOs and how that relationship is evolving kind of with the innovation pipeline that you have as well? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Erin. Look, we think the DSOs are an important space for us, we're getting a very positive reaction. And if you think about DSOs and kind of groups, you've got kind of the really large national, obviously, we have strong relationships with some of them on total equipment and we are forever looking to expand that. We really believe that we are in sync with what the DSOs are doing. If you really break down what the biggest single cost of an Aspen, Heartland or Pacific is it's their dentists, how much time does - how productive are the dentists?","And if you look at stuff like Primescan, which works really quickly, I mean you can do a full arch in under a minute, and if you look at how the software we put with CEREC, the reaction we're getting from is pretty positive. Well, this saves time, I can get my dentist to do more procedures.","So we feel - if you look at what we're doing with like Surefil one , again, it's a four-step process versus an eight-step to 13-step process. So we feel that the DSOs are significant opportunity for us. We're spending a lot of time with them. We really look at that as a key customer group for us, and the reaction to Prime has been pretty good. We want the reaction to our Orthophos to be pretty good as well.","So again, we're - our DSO strategy has evolved in the last two years, I mean we now from a sales perspective, we have a dedicated DSO group where we're spending a lot of time there. So long term, we're optimistic that this is - it's going to be an area that we can continue growing and partnering with them to deliver better patient outcomes and better productivity for their own dentists.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I also reminder, this conference call maybe recorded for reply purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. John Sweeney. Sir, you may begin.","John Sweeney","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I'd like to remind you that the earnings press release and slide presentation related to this call are available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","But before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. And during today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. And our most recent Form 10-K list some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Now with that, I'll turn the program over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer, Dentsply Sirona.","Donald Casey","Thanks, John, and thank you for joining us on our earnings call. Overall, we are pleased with the second quarter performance and we remain focused on delivering the core elements of our restructuring plans that includes growth, margin improvement and organization simplification.","Second quarter internal growth reached 3% in-line with the target we outlined last November. We feel good about our strong new product lineup which we expect to deliver sales growth in the back half of the year. Our new simplified structure is improving our efficiency and has enabled us to make significant progress against our headcount goals.","Today we reduce FTE [ph] by approximately1000 heads giving us the flexibility to be more selective with new hires to drive key growth and strategic initiatives.","Second quarter gross margin was 58.2% up 130 basis points compared to prior year. Operating disciplines contribute to an almost 300 basis points improvement in our adjusted operating income margin levels, which came in at 20.2 for the quarter.","Our second quarter along margin level bears testament to the progress we have made in executing our strong [ph] margin level bears testament to the progress we have made in executing our restructuring.","Our results clearly demonstrate and sales growth, with discipline spending management create significant operating leverage, which drove an adjusted EPS of $0.66, up 10% compared to prior year. Operating cash flow was strong at a $145 million, up $28 million as compared to prior year.","So overall, it was a solid quarter. And I'll now hand it over to Nick, who will review our financials.","Nick Alexos","Thank you, Don.","Looking at slide eight, our consumable segments accounted for 44% of our revenue for the second quarter and represents a diverse portfolio of products that are sold globally. In the second quarter, consumable revenues ex-precious metals were $442 million, down 7.8% as compared to prior year and down 4.1% on an internal growth basis. This performance was clearly below our long-term growth expectation for the consumable business of 2% to 3%.","Let me highlight key issues that drove the decline. Our consumable business tends to be very steady on an annual basis. But we're seeing variation by geographic market in the quarter-to-quarter results.","As we've analyzed this, we saw a trade program that impacted retail versus wholesale sales. To address this, we have now put in place a more disciplined approach and will focus on driving retail consumption, leading to a net reduction in wholesale-oriented promotion activities. Consequently, we had a flattening of our sales over a few quarters.","We retain a very positive outlook on the consumables market and continue to believe that our growth will be 2% to 3% next year. I\u2019d also note that we have a strong new product line up in the back half of this year that will help to bring our performance back towards a normal run rate.","Consumable margins of 27.6% declined 240 basis points as compared to prior year. The reduction in the consumable operating income margin was due to low volumes and an unfavorable foreign exchange, which together more than offset our cost control initiatives.","On slide nine we highlight our Technology and Equipment segment, which accounted for 56% of revenue. Second quarter T&E revenues were $515 million up 0.6% versus prior year, but a healthy 9.3% on an internal growth basis, driven by the success of our focused innovation initiatives. All of our T&E product categories, equipment instruments, digital, implants and healthcare show positive results year-over-year during the quarter.","Our strongest growth came from digital products which continues to benefit from the successful launch of our Primescan CAD\/CAM digital impression scanning system. The [Indiscernible] saw continue growth up mid-single digits and implant continued its positive performance up 2% in the quarter.","Technology and Equipment operating income margins were 17.2% up 480 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter and higher volume driven by the successful launch of Primescan and our ongoing cost reduction and portfolio shaping initiatives.","On slide 10, we look at our business performance on a regional basis. U.S. revenues were $328 million down with 3.3% compared to the prior year and down 1.5% on our internal sales growth basis.","We experienced mid-single digit growth in our Technology and Equipment segment driven by strong CAD\/CAM sales and the impact of our prior year dealer inventory destocking. Consumable sales decline as compared to prior year.","European revenues were $415 million down 1% compared to prior year and up 7.1% on internal basis. Europe T&E internal revenues increased double digits boosted by the IDS event offset by a slight decline in consumable sales.","Rest of world revenues were $257 million down 6.9% compared to the prior year, but up 2.4% on internal basis. T&E growth was not as high as the other regions because we are not yet shipping Primescan to some of these countries.","As a result, we are seeing customers slow their purchases of Omnicam and anticipation of the new technology. We expect to start shipping Primescan to these markets later in 2019. Consumable revenues were flattish in the rest of the world.","We have our consolidated non-GAAP P&L on slide 11. Revenues excluding precious metals were a $1 billion down 3.3%, but up 3% on an internal growth dollar down 3.3% but up 3% on internal growth basis driven by strong sales in technology and equipments.","Gross profit was $582.1 million or 58.2% up 130 basis points as compared to the prior year. The gross profitable improvement was driven by a cost containment initiative in a more favorable exchange environment.","Total operating expenses were $380.3 million or down 6.9% is compared to prior year. As a percent of sales SG&A was 38% down 150 basis points as compared to prior year. Our cost containment initiatives including our headcount reduction, and portfolio shaping initiatives reduced SG&A as a percent of sales by over 325 basis points.","As Don noted earlier, we have already reduced our headcount by approximately 1000 STE [ph]. The spending and headcount discipline anticipated to be a key driver of our income growth going forward.","In the second quarter, there was a year-over-year increase in companywide performance-based compensation expense of $27 million, which is out there to the settlement in impact and gross margins.","This is a function of a comparison of 2018 with a challenging business results with a very low incentive compensation being paid. Further this challenging performance in 2018 also resulted in a reduction in the long-term incentive program expense tied to three-year performance goals.","The fact that we're able to absorb these compensation expenses while delivering significantly improved margins demonstrates our commitment to our cost improvement programs and our operating margin target. These factors give an operating income of $201.8 million and the operating margin of 20 [ph].","The tax rate for the quarter was 25.3, replacing our updated our full year view of 24.75 and a year to date catch up. Increase in the tax rate is due to the impact on the change in expected earnings mix with more earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.66 up almost 10% compared to $0.60 in the prior quarter.","Slide 12 shows cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2019 was $145.1 million up 24.1% versus prior year. Free cash flow as cash flow from operations with capital expenditures was $115.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 up 61.5% versus a year ago. Capital expenditures in the second quarter was 29.6 down $15.8 million versus prior year.","During the second quarter, we utilized our strong cash flow to buy back 60 million shares repurchase under our outstanding authorization program. This share repurchase highlights the confidence we have in our business and our belief that Dentsply Sirona represents a good investment at current price levels.","In addition, today, we are announcing that we are increasing your quarterly dividend from $0.0875 to $0.10, a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend underscores our belief in the stability and long-term cash generation capabilities of the company. Together with our buyback program, this move highlights our commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders.","Finally, this is my last quarterly call with Dentsply Sirona. I want to thank our investors and our analysts for their insights and my full team across the globe for the commitment and passion to the business.","I also want to thank Don for his vision and insights regarding all the changes we've made. This is a company with exceptional strength and prospects. I look forward to working with my successor Jorge Gomez during the transition and then tracking the performance of the company and a continuing shareholder.","With that, and I will turn the call back over to Don.","Donald Casey","Thanks Nick.","Let me first cover off an important executive appointment. We recently announced Jorge Gomez will assume the role of Executive Vice President and CFO of Dentsply Sirona effective in late August.","His role will include finance, Treasury, tax, Investor Relations, information technology and the office of business transformation. With Jorge we bring a talented global executive with an in-depth knowledge of the health care industry. I believe he is bringing the right mix of skills and experience as well as a solid track record of successfully managing global financial operations.","Prior to joining Dentsply Sirona, Jorge was CFO with Cardinal Health. Before that he had many other roles with increasing responsibilities within that organization. He also has experience with General Motors and Smurfit-Kappa Group.","Having worked with Jorge for several years, I'm excited to bring his unique blends of commitment, business judgment and passion for people with Dentsply Sirona.","Moving to slide 15, I would like to provide a brief update on the progress we are making against our restructuring goals. That restructuring was built around three core plans [ph] as we've set, revenue growth, improving, and simplifying the organization.","Slide 16 provides a detailed update on the major components of that restructure. We've been operating in our new products groups as well as our streamline regional commercial structure close to six months. As the organization head over 100 years of history and the old structure, this represents a major change.","We have consolidated supply chain and brought in world class talent to help us create a single structure to manage manufacturing, logistics, planning and procurement. This group is off to a fast start and this is a key reason where gross margin improved 130 basis points as compared to prior year in the second quarter.","We have rolled out a comprehensive sales force effectiveness program in the U.S under the direction of new leadership that we recruit from the outside. It will still be a few months before we are able to really look at progress against KPIs that we've set out for this group. But to-date, we are comfortable with the progress that we made and the results that we're seeing. We will be rolling that S&P program at other major RCOs over the next 12 months.","Further, we have taken a much more disciplined portfolio approach to R&D, which has helped us this year and we believe it will impact the business going forward.","Based on these activities, we had a stronger portfolio today and we've seen a real uptick in our new product activity with items like Primescan, SureFil one, TruNatomy and other new products leading the way. We have also seen progress around our portfolio shaping activities that includes the divestiture for closing of four business subunits.","Turning to slide 17, you will see that we've made progress against our expense management program as well as headcount. At this point, our headcount reductions have moved faster than planned.","We are now entering the phase where we are selectively going to add head backs to critical growth initiatives, but we will do so in a very disciplined fashion with our target of 15,000 and 15,300 by mid-2020 in line.","On slide 18, we reiterate our long-term financial targets for Dentsply Sirona, eight months into our restructuring our confidence in delivering these goals has increased and we believe that we're firmly on track to deliver revenue growth of 3% to 4% and we hit margin of 20% 2020 and 22% by 2022 and double-digit EPS growth going forward.","Now on slide 19, let me cover of our guidance for full year 2019. As you saw in our press release, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 by near to a range to 235 to 245. The changes in the model include first. We are raising the operating margin guidance from 17% to 18% to 18% to 19% for the year. This is driven by efficiency in our gross profit and SG&A lines.","Second as noted the tax rate for 2019 is now expected to be 24.75% up 75 basis points as compared to our previous guidance. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance revenue range of $3.95 million to $4.05 billion and our internal growth rate target of 4% to 5%.","One different point that I would like to highlight is the impact of our performance-based compensation as compared to prior year. As you all know 2018 was a difficult year for the company and as a result a very low level of incentive compensation was earned.","In 2019 there is been an improvement in terms of expected revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. This will result in an increase this year in incentive compensation expenses to a more robust historic level. Further, we're now accruing against a specific performance incentive program tied to achieving progress against critical KPI that were outlined as part of the restructuring plan.","These incentive compensation programs were incorporated in our budgeting process and are designed to impact a broad cross section of employees and great alignment for entire company.","As a result of our performance, we have an annualized sale of $60 in compensation expense year-over-year 27 million of which was accrued in the second quarter. Despite this, we expect to expand margins by approximately 300 basis points and increase EPS 14% to 19% in 2019.","With respect to the remaining quarters, we expect strong growth in our T&E's segment revenue and improve growth in our consumable segment.","Along with WTS while it will be a -- that occurs in the third quarter of 2018. That resulted in a shift of revenues from the third into the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result, we expected the third quarter revenues will be up low single digits on an internal growth basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate SG&A to be flat to slightly down from Q2 levels.","Looking at our operating margin in the first half of the year, with OI margins of 15.6% in the first quarter, and 20.2% in the second quarter. As a result of the DS world change and the timely spending, we anticipate third quarter margins to resemble in the first quarter of 2019 with stronger margin performance in the fourth quarter.","Net interest and other expense were 3.9 million in Q2 and we expect a similar run rate in the third and fourth quarters. To call it, it was a solid quarter, which I would like to thank the entire Dentsply Sirona team.","We've really shown tremendous commitment to delivering for our patients, customers employees and our shareholders. The company has demonstrated over the last few quarters that real innovation and disciplined execution can deliver improved results. And while we are happy with what we've achieved, we recognize there is still a very long way to go.","We have said that progress will not be in a straight line, and that we are managing a lot of change within the company. But we do look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.","As mentioned, this marks the final earnings call for Nick Alexos. It has been a real pleasure working with Nick since past 18 months. Due to his unmatched commitment to the business, his team and his peers. He certainly has played a key role in making Dentsply Sirona better company today than when he took over the role. We are grateful for his work and wish him well on his future endeavors.","And with that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Q - Elizabeth Anderson","Thanks. Good morning, guys. It would be helpful to get a little bit of color behind what you were talking about the channel. It was an excellent in the consumables channel in the quarter?","Donald Casey","Sure. Thanks Elizabeth. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. You know, why don't I just take a quick step back and kind of walk through our thinking on consumables and then you know, deals specifically with the channel inflows and outflows.","Obviously, we're not comfortable and happy with where we are in consumables. And when you look at the numbers we saw, the first quarter, second quarter, you kind of step back and ask yourself a couple questions.","I mean the first is, do we think the market is fundamentally changed on a global basis? And, you know, we see a lot of retail trends and talking to dentist and looking at patient count, we don't feel there has been a fundamental shift in the marketplace.","But our analysis really showed us two things. I mean the first is if you look at our innovation track record over the last 18 months, particularly the consumables segment, we did not have a whole lot of big innovation. And, I think when you're in categories like our preventive and resto business or endo business without innovation. You don't see the sales force excitement; you don't see the opportunities to grow.","The second thing was that we saw is a lot of the movement, we think consumables are pretty steady. But there is a fair amount of movement, as Nick mentioned, quarter to quarter. If you go back to Q4 of 2017, we saw a very aggressive program that resulted inventory and we worked that off in Q2, you saw things like [indiscernible] where we had difficult time shipping things in the in Q3, and then ship the things into Q4. And our dealer partners were questioning how reliable we were going to be in shipment, so you saw a different kind of order patterns.","I mean, literally a year ago, our lab business, not a business, we talk a great deal about, we saw some very aggressive activity. And we're not seeing that anniversaried because we're now starting to take what we believe is a much more disciplined approach to how we are looking at our promotional dollars.","And for that, we want to really focus on things that are going to deliver sustainable retail progress versus focus on wholesale. So, we're working with our dealer partners to say, how do we incentivize your reps to really focus at the dentist level?","We talked to our sales force and we talked about our marketing programs all -- how do we reorient those to really focus on the retail level versus the wholesale level.","And when you do that, there's going to be a little bit of flattening quarter-to-quarter. And ultimately what we believe is, as we get into the back half of the year, two things will occur. First, we will have kind of normalized the wholesale retail pattern.","And more importantly for us, we think we've got a terrific backhand lineup of new products. I mean, whether it's TruNatomy in our anatomy business, we're very excited about short to one, we have a digital venture that have come out in our lab business which we think will give that business a real shot beyond.","And so, we'll look at as we get through the back half of the year. And as we look 2020 and beyond, we really believe that a more focused disciplined approach to how we promote, and more importantly, how we innovate and really drive innovation across the four consumer businesses in that particular segment, we get excited about the growth opportunities, and we think return to a much more normal level.","So yeah, what you're seeing right now is what we believe is a slight shift in our promotional philosophy that we are working with our dealers hand in hand, that's going to result in a little bit of a flattening as we really look to equalize our retail shipments and our wholesale shipments.","Elizabeth Anderson","Perfect, that's very helpful. And then as we think about you obviously had a nice uptake in the gross margin line year-over-year, as we think about the pacing throughout the rest of the year on that line, is there anything you think you would particularly call out that we should be aware of?","Nick Alexos","It's Nick speaking. Nothing particular, we expect our gross margins to be relatively stable, versus the Q2 level that you're seeing on going through the rest of the year.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. It sounds like your dental implant businesses doing a little bit better. I think you said 2%. Can you talk about how that has trended over the last year? Is it in fact better? And in what's driving it?","Donald Casey","Yeah. Hey, John, thanks for the question. Implants, a couple things on our implant business. We made a pretty significant shift from a leadership perspective, we brought in one of our real strong veterans, his name is Gene Dorff and we're really starting to operate our implant business as a group before we have four very significant brands, and they were each kind of pursuing their own strategy.","So, basically, by beginning to consolidate that beginning to look at manufacturing efficiencies, more importantly, R&D and mapping out where we need to go from an innovation perspective, and really taking a more focused approach in terms of how we look at each of the brands and promote those brands. We feel that we're starting to get traction in the marketplace","I can tell you that, we want to get that business, and what we think we have a clear path to over the next year or two is how do we get that business, which is positive and has been positive for the past couple quarters. We really want that business to growing, at least the category levels.","And we believe the brands, the R&D portfolio that we're starting to put together and a more disciplined approach to blocking and tackling gives us an opportunity to potentially start gaining share as we go out. But, credit to that team, they've really taken something that we've seen several consecutive quarters that decline year-on-year to the point, where we feel that we're starting to see some positive growth, we still have an opportunity to expand that growth, aspiration to at least achieve what the category is done.","John Kreger","Great, thank you. And then one quick follow-up, how are these -- how are your specialty businesses doing versus your more kind of GP oriented businesses? Are they -- are you seeing similar trends there? Or is one doing better than the other?","Donald Casey","Well, look, obviously the thing we're most excited about in our -- from a growth opportunity, John is our ortho business, we're -- we feel very good that we've spent a lot of time getting SureSmile at a point where we're starting to gain traction, where we have an opportunity to expand that overseas -- what's principally a U.S. program today. So, we're excited about that. We're starting to see good traction there.","When our endo business, we're kind of hold and serve. I think one of the things we're excited about the fourth quarter is TruNatomy, which is really in our mind an opportunity to have a very good conversation with the endo community, the very important specialist community to us about the role of having a less invasive procedure where you're really preserving that that's what your anatomy does.","So, that's, that's kind of a little bit of a different thought process and that, and it gives us an opportunity to really shine as we believe new products clinical educations what we do well, and so, especially with businesses really important to us, we feel that implants and ortho really, really moving in the right way.","We think endo is hold and serve, but we -- in our mind, once we get some new product momentum, which is coming in the fourth quarter that we're very, very focused on getting that business moving faster than it is today.","Nick Alexos","And John, just you may know this, but just to clarify, both ortho and implants are a T&E segment as they relate to some of our digital technologies. The others as Don mentioned are the consumable segment.","John Kreger","Great, thanks, Nick. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, good morning. Don. I want to go back to consumables for a minute I appreciate the call you provided before but you know as we think about what you laid out how much of the recovery is dependent on you know, the trading program ending and maybe shifting your go to market strategy versus innovation, SureFil, TruNatomy some of these things you highlighted coming out IDM?","Donald Casey","Look, I think the alignment of retail and wholesale is that that's finished in the back half of this year. And after that it really becomes, in my opinion, an innovation story.","I will also tell you having spent a fair amount of time in the field, which has been really terrific in the last couple months, I'm optimistic that we really focus on retail programs and the deal reps excited, get our reps excited, we've kind of revamped our U.S. leadership team and we're- - I think we're ramping up the effectiveness of our marketing program, I feel good that that's going to be a step in the right direction. And I tend to think that's the first three quarters of this year event.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then maybe one for Nick on margins, you're going to exit this year at 20%. Obviously, guidance is for 20% next year, as well. So, how do we think about that dynamic is there is there a reinvestment cycle we have to think about next year, is there something that could happen additional margin recovery?","Nick Alexos","Yes, I would say Tycho, we didn't say we would exit this year 20%. Obviously, we had a good quarter, or right now, our target is been revised to be 18% to 19% versus a previous guidance, of 17% to 18% given the realization of some of the cost savings earlier. We do expect to make strategic investments that will get us into that guidance range through the end of the year.","And clearly with our targeted cost savings building into next year, we feel we have very good momentum to get through that end the year 20 next year, there is no change to our view on guidance for 2020. And clearly, we feel better given where we are, year-to-date for the rest of the year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, and then maybe one last one for Don. Just can you comment on SureSmile? I know it's early days, but just curious what tracks has been like in the field?","Donald Casey","Yes, I would say you know, first we were pretty excited that we're actually able to get our GP software up and launched. And that's been an important event for us, I think we're getting in what we're finding is that we're getting trial at the ortho level, you know, they want to understand whether the system and obviously crown [ph] is a little bit different than some of the some of the competitors, they want to understand that.","So, we're getting trial there, we're getting good traction with the GPs, you know, where they're not necessarily set with a specific system. So, you know, with ortho, it's kind of how many clear liner programs do they want to be running in their office? As, you know, do they stay focused on one can we offer multiples where the GPs is not set, so we're getting a little bit more traction there.","You know, the opportunity. We're also seeing SureSmile, Tycho, as you probably know, we tend to be North American focus right now. And we're looking forward to expanding that beyond the North American area right now. So, you know that that started into Europe, and we're optimistic we're going to start seeing approvals in Asia and in the not too distant future.","Tycho Peterson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Johnson","Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. Don maybe I'll start was a Primescan question. Just can you talk about kind of product availability when you think you might be able to service, and upgrade program obviously have a very big installed base of users both in the U.S. and globally. So that could be a nice catalyst for later this year. Does that go into next year?","And maybe is Primescan at all shifting the DI versus Sure conversation? How are the DI sales going with regard or relative to full direct system sales? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Yeah, thanks, Jeff. Right now, it's going to take us to the fourth quarter to fully be able to meet demand for Primescan. Look, we're very happy with demand for Primescan so far and, again credit to our manufacturing team, they're able to get some stuff out in Q1.","But demand is exceeded our ability to manufacture stuff out on Q! But demand has exceeded our ability to manufacture and we expect that -- as we get into the fall, again, demand has been good, so I can't give you an exact, this is exactly where we're going to be able to service all the demand.","Based on that, and I know you're aware of this, we have not at this point offers an upgrade program, as we head into DSO, which is in October this year. We're really trying to understand what base demand is, and what is our manufacturing before we really get to consider whether we think an upgrade program is something that we want to do so, look, ultimately, we understand that we've got a large installed base, that base by the way has been really excited about it. And but until we really know exactly where we are from a manufacturing perspective, we're reluctant to go out and come an open ended that there's going to be an upgrade program.","That being said, I would tell you right now, we have been very gratified that we are selling full systems, the focus of the sales force is being out and selling full systems. But I\u2019ll also tell you, the thing that has surprised us from a little bit of an outside perspective has been the performance of DI space.","When we launched the product, there was we've been [indiscernible] side, we haven\u2019t had a lot of experience of really driving the DI space, and we've seen good results there.","Jeff Johnson","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then I meant to lead off, Nick, just wishing you best of luck. I've enjoyed working with you. So maybe a question for you or Don, on the consumable side. Don, as I heard, kind of your discussion of where consumables go and some of the wholesale issues, maybe in the near term here.","One thing I didn't hear you really address is just kind of some of the pricing and bundling things. We're starting to hear some out of more of the competitors. And, look at now that you guys have rearrange revenue segments a couple quarters ago that 27% operating margin and consumables seems like it's probably a good 10 points higher than some of your closest competitors on this on like for like products.","So, how are you feeling about pricing on the consumable side of the business, you think that can stay positive going forward, do you feel like you have to bundle or do any other initiatives just given some of the pressures we're seeing from bigger DSOs and other kind of buying groups things like that? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Yeah, thanks, Jeff. We've been -- we feel pretty good about price in the consumable segment, we as we move up to Q2, we've been able to hold price, I believe, and I don't mean to beat a dead horse here. But we've got to be about innovation.","And one of the things when we talk about your data, and we talk about shorter bill, one, we talk about this digital center, digital venture program that we're pushing out the lab space, it's all designed in our mind to really represent a significant innovation and with innovation, we're going to look to get price.","So, in terms of bundling, in my mind, I don't use bundling defensively at this point and as a way of protecting the consumable business. I do think as the big ship moves forward, the opportunity we have is really working with the dentist to provide complete solutions and whether that's using our digital equipment, whether that's, the CBCT and DI program to really facilitate, better procedure outcomes and faster procedure outcomes.","And we believe that if we can really get our diagnostic program working better, with either specialty products or the consumable products in a way that it helps the dentist practice better. We think that's how we win.","So, whether that's -- I don't view that as a practical bundling situation as much as, the reason we put the company together is to become much more of a procedure\u2019s solution company than an individual feature and benefits, consumable product company.","So, look there's an opportunity to bundle things and we will when appropriate, but in my mind, it's less about defense then offense, and it's much more about helping them do better procedures.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks, guys. Don, some of it, and you had solid European sales, but you also had some IDS sort of shopping versus buying comments that you called out last quarter. So maybe if you can talk about your thoughts on the IDS follow through that Dentsply Sirona saw, was it Primescan specific, was it more broad based, and do you believe that does have a tail into the third quarter results? And then I've got a follow up.","Donald Casey","Okay, good, Jon, and we'll take the follow-on obviously. IDS was interesting and first, we did see a good solid T&E event and particularly what we're seeing is in our DAC region which is Germany, Austria, Switzerland. And we talked to positive IDS results. It's hard to measure and what we were trying to figure out is how much purchasing is going to go on from beyond the dark region, because with 160,000 dentists become a very global event, where we going to see purchases.","So, two things that I think we learned this IDS is that the world comes to shop at IDS, the doc, dentist come to buy. Now, the interesting impact for us that's kind of been the positive, but it's also has an offset is that particularly out of Asia, they all saw Primescan. And they all were very excited about Primescan, when we have Primescan and the problem with Primescan, we didn't have it approved. We've just gotten prime approved in Japan recently.","And so, as a result, we saw a less T&E in rest of the world then we might have, if they hadn't been shopping and you've seen IDS. So, I view IDS and the word we use is shopping and we had great traffic, we had great results, very positive feedback from all the dentists that attended the event. But they go back to Japan and want to purchase Primescan and Primescan wasn't there. And as a result, we didn't sell as much omni as we may have thought we were going to, because we saw the different anticipation of when Primescan is going to come out.","So again, I think IDS show that it's a very good event for us in Central Europe. We have to be thoughtful about how we forecast that business two years from now. But we're -- look, we think we had a great IDS just in terms of we were able to expose dentists to SureFil, we were able to expose them to just stuff like TruNatomy preemptively. So, it was -- in my mind, kind of like a global launch.","And that saves us a lot of time from a global launch perspective, when those sales show up, is going to be more a function of when approvals are by region, then specifically tied to the IDS event.","Jon Block","Got it. Very helpful. And the second question, more of a clarification. So, for consumables, I think you called out, 3Q will be better than 2Q. But just to be clear, you expect consumables to return the growth in the third quarter. And then Nick, is there sort of a collective or cumulative FX headwind that you're seeing in '19, relative to the initial guidance you gave 6 plus months ago? Thanks, guys.","Nick Alexos","Yes, I just click on the FX and there is FX guidance it's a little bit more than what we gave them the last call a year-over-year, it's about $100 million. I think given the strength of the U.S. dollar, literally day-to-day and some of the continued weakness in the UK on Sterling, that might be $10 million or $20 million more versus $100 million year-over-year headwind. I think the general comment on the consumables is, we expect strengthening to the back end of the year, I get into a positive number, and certainly building momentum into next year.","Jon Block","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Steven Valiquette","Good morning, Don, Nick and also let me wish Nick the best of luck moving forward in his career.","Nick Alexos","Thanks.","Steven Valiquette","My question here is just tying a few things together. This whole notion around the Primescan demand outstripping supply in mid-2019, which is a high-class problem that had, and you mentioned in your remarks the notion of the stronger demand for Primescan in the diminished planned border of Omnicam. But it didn't seem to really have any negative impact on the 2Q sales results in the net basis.","I guess we had the question is and tying into the last question. Thinking about the -- just regionally. Are we seeing that you're able to meet the demand for Primescan, maybe in North America? But maybe in other regions, there is more of a kind of a delta between this demand? Maybe just talk to regionally about the supply demand delta on Primescan? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Steve. Look, right now, North America is the principal area, where we're trying -- we're playing catch up to supply and demand. We feel that we've done a pretty good job on meeting demand in Europe.","We recently got approvals in Asia Pacific. And once we have approval, we have to decide when we're going to launch, but it's the principal disparity right now, it's been a U.S. based issue.","And we're making progress. I mean, it's not that customers are waiting months, people who are placing orders aren't getting those orders serviced and the time to - between order and when we're able to actually deliver is getting shorter and shorter.","But we really haven't turned the sales force to lose yet in terms of -- let's go out and really beat the drums, because we want to be careful that somebody takes an order and we wouldn't be able to deliver it for three months.","So, we're getting better at it. And again, I can't give you the exact day or the week, but we feel good by fourth quarter on a global basis, we should be able to meet demand for what we anticipate, but it's still -- that day is a little, it's still in the future.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, and then just a quick theoretical question, just throw it out there on the softer [indiscernible]. I am just curious from an industry perspective, are you seeing, it may be any phenomenon that consumer directed, clear liners, which we're seeing incredibly high-volume gains across the industry. Is that perhaps is leading to software in both the GP and orthodontic and patient visits overall, maybe that's playing a role in software consumables, or do you think that's just off base and far as that theory. Just get your thoughts around that. Thanks,","Donald Casey","That\u2019s interesting question, Steve. I mean, I, obviously, we were watching the consumable business pretty closely. Look, we think the underlying retail patterns are not robust, but they're really not in the state of decline.","So, it could be something that impacts it. But, again, if we were to draw a straight line on what we think retail, and the principal consumable, preventive resto areas over the last 18 months, 24 months, we feel that demands pretty steady, it\u2019s not, by the way, it's not four to five, we tend to think it's one to two, and maybe in the last two quarters, it's been kind of a zero to 1.5.","But, whether that's whether that's a function of people spending their money on more static and functional dentistry, that could be a factor, it's not going to be really looked at. Kind of ironic, to thinking put a clear line around on that change.","Steven Valiquette","Got, a lot of theoretical language thrown out there. But I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from line of Michael Cherney with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Cherney","Thanks so much, just circling back on the consumable side and thinking about that transition with the wholesale retail side. Is there any cost associated with it, and as you think about that transition versus other companies that may have gone through certain dynamics in the past, what are the milepost, you're looking forward to feel confident that this is more temporary in nature, and will pass over time?","Donald Casey","Thanks, Michael, for the question. From a cost basis, now, there's not a cost associated with that, we'd like to think that we're just going to get more bang for the buck for the marketing and the programs. So, I don't see there being a cost.","And then the milestones that we want to see is we think retail is growing 2%, and we think we're holding share, we think our wholesale should look a lot like that. And, that's the key milepost that we're really looking at.","Michael Cherney","And just have any potential desire interest to go more direct, or is that something that's, not really in the planning right now?","Donald Casey","I think it's interesting on the consumable side, we go through with 25 listed dealers, we think they do a pretty good job for us. There is an advantage to a dealer in terms of the dentist likes the ability to sit and talk to a dealer, and we look forward to continuing working with them. But we right now feel dentist had great access to our consumable products.","Michael Cherney","And then just one more quick one, I know this dynamic impacted consumable in the quarters you've discussed. I think there is also some dynamics, as you mentioned about the comp\u2019s component, as you think going forward. And if you were to normalize for this, how do you feel that consumables are trending relative to all the comp adjusted factors that could be put in play?","Nick Alexos","I would say overall; we're trending below where we should be. But I think some of the things that we're putting in place, particularly the shift and the promotions that we talked about, and the new products will get us back to that positive level and where we think kind of the market is going into 2020.","Michael Cherney","Okay. Thanks, so much for the color and good luck, Nick.","Nick Alexos","Thank you.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. You mentioned the innovation story several times and I'm just curious kind of excluding some of the dealer and channel dynamics. Is some of those new product launches on the consumer side actually did help some underlying trend, excluding some of those external factors.","And just more broadly, I guess, how should we think about the longer-term annual contribution from some of these new product launches and consumables couldn't be enough to add a percentage point or two to consumables growth on an annual basis? How should we be thinking about that? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks to the question Erin. Look, I think the consumable products tend to be much more back half have been. So I, -- what we were really limited in terms of how broad we went with shorter digital dentures comps in the fourth quarter, TruNatomy was more a Europe event in Q2 and it rolls out in the North American space, really kind of in the mid to late third quarter. So, we -- I don't think it was a big contributor to Q2 on an underlying basis, I think it'll be a much bigger contributor as we go forward in the back half of the year.","I will tell you that, as we believe that our new products should be able to be a point gainer, or potentially higher in the consumables business. So, I mean, I think if you look at the base consumable business, our formula overtime is we really think that we ought to be adding innovative products that can be margin and growth accretive.","So, and, we have given you guys an outlook that we think that that for us should be overtime 2% plus, and we think in the patients the way we're going to get there. So yes, I do think you have to measure -- yet have to factor in what we think the new products are going to do year-on-year.","And, look, if you look at 2018, new product versus 2017, there is not a lot going on there. If you look on the consumable side, 2019 versus 2018, it's going to be positive and consumables are like -- not like a technology launch where this is a big bolus, it's more of a build.","So, we're anxious to get those products out, because we think it'll excite sales force, it gives us something to talk to dentist about, they're really good product. So, we -- as we look at 2020, we really feel that those will be contributors.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then on SureSmile, when do you think that will be more meaningful from a financial perspective? I know it's still early there. And then also just there's varying different strategies and clear aligners, whether it's combination or ortho focused or GP focused or direct to consumer approaches out there, what do you think is the most meaningful opportunity for you? And how did you wake up to those opportunities for testify? I guess over the near and longer term. Thanks.","Donald Casey","Sure, we think SureSmile will become a bigger factor quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter. I mean, we think that's one of the bigger growth opportunities we have. Now remember, there's a kind of a base ortho business there, that's significantly larger than SureSmile. So, what SureSmile dose sometimes might be offset by what the base ortho business was doing.","In terms of where we are, I will tell you the three base opportunities and how we're looking at SureSmile, is actually right now ex-U.S., we're really trying to focus on getting that up and running.","That's one of the advantages at Dentsply Sirona, we have a global footprint. The fact is right now as we go out and push out Primescan, gives us a great opportunity to have a conversation with the prospective Primescan customers as well as our based CEREC doctors as an opportunity to sell SureSmile.","And, the last issue was right now within North America, we're seeing more traction on the GP side, particularly after we launched our GP software. But we are optimistic given the capabilities and the product attributes that SureSmile that's going to be very relevant in the ortho space.","The ortho space is it's a discussion about whether they want to replace a system or add a system. And that takes a little bit longer than a potential GP that doesn't have a system today. So, just in quick Erin, I think it's ex-U.S. it is partnering with Primescan. And then it was, -- I think GP will see more traction sooner than later. But we're optimistic long-term. We think we've got a great product with us.","Erin Wright","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Donald Casey","Thanks Erin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the questions. Don, on consumables are there any categories that you would call out in particular that drove the underperformance in the quarter? And then you mentioned the need to be more disciplined with promotional activity going forward. Can you maybe just talk about what that entails and kind of how quickly some of these changes can be implemented as we think about the go forward?","Donald Casey","Yes, we kind of hinted at it. But our lab business was an underperformer in Q2, both in the U.S. and [indiscernible] basis, it's a business without a heck of a lot of bounce, but it's kind of our teeth, and there is some equipment business that goes there.","And we were up against a tough comp in Q2 and that was based on some programs that had been done in the prior year that led to some significant orders that we're not anniversaried.","And then in terms of the disciplined approach, again, it's going to take a couple quarters. And we saw some of that in Q2, we saw some in Q1, some in Q2, and we think we come out of that in the back half of this year.","And, what it means is let's just really be focusing on programs that impact the dentist, and, we're working with our dealers, it's like, how do you incent the dealer rep? How do you incent our reps to really get excited about some of the new products that we're launching, and make sure that we're spending on there versus maybe we'll get a corporate program where it might be a little bit more wholesale oriented.","Nathan Rich","Okay, and just to clarify, in terms of your expectations for the back half of the year, you know, the magnitude of improvement, just between three 3Q and 4Q, just what your expectations are, as we think, over the next year quarters.","Nick Alexos","Yes, and I thought we try to spell that out in my section. So, look, I would tell you, we think Q3 is -- it's kind of if you look at the margins, we're holding them, we think that the biggest issue we're going to face Q3, and Q4 is last year TS [ph] was a big Q3 event, and it's going to be a big Q4 event this year. And we look at the new products to be much more than Q4 than a Q3 event. So, you know, that's kind of how we waited out. And then the pulse of the prepared remarks as well as other stuff. You know, we feel that Q4 is obviously bigger than Q3.","Nathan Rich","So, okay. Appreciate that. If I could just as one quick follow up on Primescan? How should we be thinking about kind of the size of the backlog at this point? And how are you managing kind of priorities for me demand is capacity ramps up as we think about, you know, the geographic expansion and getting into some of these markets in Asia pack, you know, versus getting an upgrade program in place. Can you just kind of talk about your thought process there?","Donald Casey","Yes. And basically, the way to think about it is that it's right now we're meeting demand is just how fast you meet demand. You know, there's not a dentist that, you know, we're just saying you can't have a Primescan, it's like, okay, it's going to take us a little while to get there.","And then we're prioritizing, right now North America is the priority, I mean we've got a significant opportunity here. I mean, we have a large installed base that has been very interested in line with the product.","We still believe that dentistry is 17% to 18%, the U.S. is really an area that we can continue pushing. So will really make sure that the U.S. is taken care of, and that will move to other regions.","But you know, they were also focused on you know, going to Japan, let's get into some of the KOLs, let's get into people who are really important to creating a story there. But it's North America right now.","And then, this is not a gigantic backlog. It's just, as we look at it, we get asked the question all the time, what are you guys going to do an upgrade program? And, you know, the question is when you get on as an upgrade program, and we've been pretty consistent answering it. Say we really want to understand what the manufacturing capabilities are versus base demand and until we really get comfortable with that. That's how we're going to manage where we think we are from an upgrade program.","Nathan Rich","Great. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come by Brandon Couillard, Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning. Now you just touched on the emerging portfolio and whether that was a positive contributor to growth continued in the quarter and then just how you're feeling about the pricing backdrop is for the market overall?","Donald Casey","Imaging was positive. If you look at the Q2, we were positive across everything in the T&E segment. We're anxious to get some of the products that we talked about and IDS approved in the U.S., we think as a fourth quarter event. Right now, the imaging businesses, we've seen a lot of price compression over the last 18-24 months. Now we built that into our budget or forecast and our guidance. So, we're not seeing significant changes versus what expectations are, and then innovate [ph].","Brandon Couillard","A follow-up for Nick. You still expect operating cash flow to be up year-over-year in '19. And then D have an updated figure for us on CapEx for the year?","Nick Alexos","Yeah, the CapEx Brendan out will be for our guidance 165 to 175. Imagine that very tightly. And then in terms of cash flow, we got to expect us to be a good cash flow year, purely as we told the street, we get about $120 million and onetime our restructuring cash that will go out this year.","The majority that will be in the second half. So that will be one time in terms of charges. But from an operating cash flow standpoint, clearly the operating income is going to be good year-over-year. And we're working on our working capital as well.","Brandon Couillard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Busha [ph]. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, Nick, for all your help over the last couple of years. Certainly, wish you all the best there.","Nick Alexos","Thanks Steve. Appreciate it.","Unidentified Analyst","As far as that are questions, I had a couple for Don. And just one quick one for Nick. But Don, I wonder if","Nick Alexos","Hey Steve, you're breaking up. Like we're getting every third word and say, early 70s horror movie?","Unidentified Analyst","Well, I'm a fan of those. But we'll try to do better here on the -- trying again. So, I guess first for Don, I was hoping you could apply it on a couple things. One is, in your assumption for the back half, do you think there are any changes in terms of the end market outlook.","You're one of few that hasn't spiked out Europe and Germany. You clearly had a really good quarter in Europe, anything you see there.","Second, I was hoping you could give us just an update on how you're seeing sales force efficiency progress. You've made some significant changes to how the sales force operates. So, just some perspective on how those changes are going to be really helpful.","And then one just quick one for you, Nick. I wonder if you could speak to the medium-term outlook for the tax rate. The guidance went up and you give some very clear commentary as why that happened. But some perspective on how things roll out in future years would be great. Thank you.","Donald Casey","Sure. Thanks, Steve. I'm always happy to opine, as my management team would attest. But you look end market, particularly in Europe, we actually, we feel pretty good that our underlying demand has been okay.","The challenge for us, there is a couple things going on. We saw a little bit of a spike in Q1 that had a ripple on Q2, which was Brexit. People were ordering anticipating that was going to happen when it didn't. And that was some inventory shifting around.","But underlying demand Europe, rest of the world, we feel pretty solid. And again, around in our mind we just got to make sure we're aligning wholesale and retail shipments and lab was a drag for us in Europe, and the rest of the world in Q2. We feel good that that takes care of itself kind of in the back half of the year.","On SAP, a couple things on SAP. First, we are operating in the U.S. We haven't ruled -- we will rule SAP out to other regions Germany, China, Japan, and other places over the course of the next 12 months. The SAP and we we've talked a little bit about this before.","First, we move everyone to sales force, we did a real segmentation and we've been focusing on what we believe are higher priority doctors. We've had to train sales force to be fluent. And one of the things we're trying to do is be able to represent or have a conversation about all of these products, even though you may be going into just selling them. That's going pretty well.","My experience with doing big SAP programs. Look, it takes six months to people you really measuring things reliably on KPIs. What we're seeing is the trend lines of reps who are in territories for a while. We're starting to see what we want to see, so we're pretty comfortable with the progress they're making to non-financial metrics.","And from an underlying perspective, we're pretty comfortable with where we are financially. I do think in, you know, a quarter or two will be in a better position to really put some meat on the bones in terms of report out against some KPI for you, for you guys to get some visibility on that.","Nick Alexos","Steve, on taxes obviously, the tax reform works against us, given us a we have a high percentage of our income coming out Central Europe, I think the current target is 2475 for the year reflects the balance of earnings as we expect them.","And that's probably a pretty good benchmark, plus or minus 50 basis points going into the future. But tax reform around the world is evolving, and I'm certainly not one they can predict that. We'll take the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So just told me understand what percentage of your consumables is currently retail versus wholesale. And what do you expect it to be once this shift is over?","Nick Alexos","Yes, Kevin, it's all in either way. Look, that is what's at the end market. So, all of our cells are retail, it's just, you know, how do you, what it through dealers? So, it's, you know, one of the dealers buying versus one who are identifying.","Kevin Caliendo","So, what is the -- what is the shift like? What are we talking about in terms of magnitude of shift of the percentage of your consumable products that you think are going to go out of dealers and maybe directed dentist?","Nick Alexos","Yes. Kevin we've reduced dialogue, and we commented on was this our promotional efforts, are going to be more targeted towards driving into retail demand, as opposed to working directly just directly with the wholesalers in terms of promotions. So, it's really just redirecting marketing effort.","Donald Casey","Yes. And, what you think of that, in all of our stuff we'll go through dealers, to the dentist, I mean, we're not going direct. It's just basically, we're trying to align, you know, if retail is growing at 3%. We want to see wholesale grow and 3%. We don't want to see wholesale grow one quarter at 9, the next quarter down 4 when underlying retail demand is relatively stable.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay, now, I understand now and is there is this question of inventories? Or is it just a question of timing? It's just interesting that there's such a scatter shot of that, if it's just a question of timing of...","Donald Casey","Yes, and I would say the one thing, you have to be mindful, we're talking about couple of small percentage points up and down on our base of business. So, you know, it's not a lot of dollars in each of the markets for each of the products. It's really just a realignment of our wanting to have more direct market stimulated. So, it's a look at it...","And selling it, we're just -- we're being measured in terms of what a dentist wants it right now. We want to be able to deliver it as quickly and reliably as we can. And right now, there's a little bit of a difference between when they purchase and when they get the product.","And that's what we're working through right now. But you know, and look, I would like I would love to have more Primescan, you know, particularly ex-U.S., and that's what we're working through right now. But we saw the 75% and improved every day.","Kevin Caliendo","I understand the install base is enormous. For Primescan to penetrate, but have you contemplated sort of doing what a line did with iTero and Invisalign, where they basically went and marketed directly to some large DSOs and were able to get big chunks of share doing that. Obviously, now you have the liner to be able to offer that a strategy you've contemplated, is that available to you?","Donald Casey","It's absolutely available to us. And it's we're not contemplating it. I mean, we're doing I mean, look, our relationship with the DSOs is really important, you know, we've had some good success with Primescan and in terms of some of the DSOs representing at all the time, and one of the first questions we get asked is, you know, do you have a program that you can put together with this and the answer is yes.","Kevin Caliendo","What do you think drive the, what would drive that sale? Would it be the liner or itself or would it be the scanner meaning like for the GP matters more?","Nick Alexos","Kevin, we're about eight years past the hour, we're going to have to limit to one question.","Kevin Caliendo","Sure.","Nick Alexos","We'll get by offline","Donald Casey","We'll give you a call, and we can run through some of those stuffs.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay, no worries. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time.","Donald Casey","No problem.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So, now, I\u2019ll hand the conference back over to Mr. John Sweeney, for any closing comments or remarks.","Donald Casey","Yeah, I wanted to close before John did and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that this is Nick's last call, but I do really and want to thank you for all the work and, he were in the middle of call, and you guys know these calls are, Nick has got a game face on right here, he\u2019s got papers all spread out and he has been an absolute -- unbelievably good partner to work with and on behalf of all Dentsply Sirona, Nick, thank you.","Nick Alexos","Thanks, Don. Thanks everybody for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we move through the quarter and our next quarterly earnings call. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect.

Today's conference is being record.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joshua Zable, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. Sir, you may begin.","Joshua Zable - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on slides two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We take these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Josh. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter and first ever conference call as Dentsply Sirona. Also joining us on the call today, Ulrich Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Technologies business; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations.","I'm delighted to report that our first quarter was a very successful one. We seamlessly completed our merger and begin working on the great opportunities ahead of us. Rather than being distracted by the merger, the team came together and was energized to perform.","In our first 67 days together, Dentsply Sirona team has much to be proud of. We've rebranded our company, announced our leadership team, and created an operating model to help optimize our growth. As you can see on the earnings presentation, we have organized our self into two segments: Dental and Healthcare Consumables; and Technologies.","Our Dental and Healthcare Consumables business is comprised of our endodontics, preventive, prosthetics, restorative, and instruments division, along with Wellspect, our healthcare business. Our Technologies business is comprised of our implant, CAD\/CAM, imaging, treatment center and the orthodontic businesses.","We organized these segments to maximize efficiency and product development and cross-selling opportunities. In addition to developing new stand-alone products, our segments will introduce integrated solutions to improve workflow in advanced patient care.","Within Technologies, our loyal install base of CAD\/CAM and imaging has been expanding to incorporate more specialty procedures. For decades, we have a proven track record of using technology to allow the dentists to advance patient care, both in terms of outcome and treatment times.","Now, we are moving towards integrated solutions, using technology combined with clinical products to provide dentists with end-to-end solutions and advance their own service capabilities. This was first evident in restoratives, but is now moving rapidly into implants, orthodontics, and endodontics. These capabilities, further facilitated with Dentsply Sirona's world-class clinical education platform, creates a powerful basis for advanced learnings in clinical settings.","Along the same lines, specialists are demanding more high-tech equipment, like 3D imaging and digital impressions. Our relationships with these practitioners will help drive adoption of our technologies.","From a product development standpoint, combining the experience and knowledge of our strategic business units, will enable the development of integrated technologies. Furthermore, by collaborating innovation should come faster and offer more to practitioners than ever before.","In Consumables, the majority of our revenues are operatory-related and often used in conjunction with one another. We are focusing on offering practitioners end-to-end solutions based on particular procedures. All root canal procedures require multiple tools and are completed with restoration. Dentsply Sirona is the only manufacturer with RestoDontics strategy, offering all the necessary instruments, equipment and consumables to diagnose and complete a root canal from start to finish.","As you can see, the goal of organizing into these segments was to accelerate adoption of all of our products, which will translate into top-line growth.","By driving growth and increasing productivity of our sales and service infrastructure, we will leverage our sales to deliver strong bottom-line growth as well. With so many opportunities ahead, we have created an integration management office to work hand-in-hand with senior management to oversee the seamless merging of both companies and cultures.","In order to capture our synergies, we have formed multiple teams to actively manage our cost of revenue initiatives. Feedback from these teams have been overwhelmingly positive. Ideas are being shared across organizations and plans are being implemented to ensure these synergies come to fruition. We are confident that we can deliver on our promise of $125 million in synergies by year three of our merger.","Capital allocation will also be important part of our go-forward strategy. Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow and we have a large and flexible balance sheet. As always, our priority is to invest in growth drivers for our business. We will also use our cash flow to make acquisitions, repurchase our stock and support our dividend.","During the quarter, we executed on the $500 million share repurchase, consistent with the announcement we made at the time of the merger. We continue to have 3.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We have flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of capital deployment, all of which will drive value for our shareholders.","The opportunity ahead of us is more significant than anything, either Dentsply or Sirona ever had on a stand-alone basis. We have never been in a better position to grow and deliver shareholder value.","Turning to the first quarter, Uli will explain some of the technicalities on the reported revenue growth. I will focus my comments here on the underlying growth of our two combined businesses. Although the merger closed on February 29, I think it is more meaningful to discuss the performance of our business during the full quarter.","We achieved strong results, with our combined businesses growing 6.5% constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products, internal sales growth was 5.5%. Geographically, we have solid growth across all regions.","Rest of World led our growth, delivering 8.4% constant currency, driven by internal sales growth of 7.5%. There continue to be a number of challenging environments around the globe, but we are much better positioned after the merger in these areas. We expect our Rest of World region to be the fastest-growing region this year.","The U.S. grew 8.8% constant currency, driven by internal growth of 5.7%, led by the Technology segment. Europe grew 3.1% constant currency, with internal sales growth of 4%, driven by solid growth in both our Technology and Consumables segments.","On a segment basis, our Technology business led our growth with 9.6% constant currency growth. Internally-generated sales grew 6.8%, led by strong growth in our high-tech products. CAD\/CAM was particularly strong ahead of our new Zirconia product launch. In Q1, Dental and Healthcare Consumables generated internal sales growth of 4.5%. Growth was driven by operatory-focused consumables.","First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.69, representing 17% growth. We achieved strong financial results while investing in R&D and in our sales and service infrastructure. We will continue to ramp these investments in Q2 to better position our accelerating growth. Innovation and best-in-class customer service will be two key pillars of our new organization. Overall, we reported a very solid first quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Uli, who will review our first quarter financials.","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete three-month period of the first quarter 2016 as if the businesses had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. I walk through the earnings performance. I will also point out any impacts of merger accounting on earnings.","In the first quarter, our reported revenues increased $116.3 million to $772.6 million, up 17.7% reported. The consolidation of one month of Sirona contributed sales of $128.9 million, which were reduced by $8.8 million to $120.1 million as a result of purchase accounting.","This reduction from our normal revenue recognition practices results from a one-time treatment of deferred income on service contracts, where any deferred income at the time of the merger is removed from future revenues and income. This one-time treatment reduced revenue by $8.8 million this quarter and will reduce future revenue by about $8 million in the aggregate over the next six quarters.","As of March 1, any new contracts are again being treated as they have been historically. For non-GAAP reporting, we will treat all the contracts existing at the time of the merger under the ongoing policy as if incurred in normal course of business.","For the full three-month period ending March 31, 2016, adjusted sales of our combined businesses excluding precious metals grew 6.5% on a constant currency basis, internal growth was 5.5%, excluding 1.7% favorable impact from net acquisition and 70 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 2.6%.","Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth for the complete quarter come together.","U.S. GAAP gross profit was $418.9 million, up $45.5 million from $373.4 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 360 basis points to 55.5% from 59.1% in the prior year.","As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about 500 basis points due to the roll-off of merger-related fair value adjustments. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program which were largely offset by negative foreign currency impacts.","Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $342.1 million, up $71.8 million versus last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metal, increased 250 basis points compared to prior year. Merger-related expenses negatively impacted the rate by about 500 basis points, partially offset by savings from the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona.","SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring expenses were $4.1 million, down $1.3 million from last year.","In total, GAAP operating income was $72.7 million, representing 9.6% of sales, excluding precious metals. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, the adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, which compares to 18.7% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona.","Due to the strong performance in March, the benefit from the consolidation is more pronounced. Had we consolidated Sirona for the complete three-month period, our adjusted operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points lower. We believe this is more representative of the current performance level of our business.","Net interest expense for the first quarter was $8.7 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year, largely driven by lower average debt levels. Other income in the first quarter was $3.4 million, with the biggest impact coming from a small business divestiture, which was removed from adjusted income.","For the three months ended March 31, 2016, income taxes were a net benefit of $57.9 million versus an expense of $18.9 million last year. As part of the merger, we will be able to generate an early synergy by recovering previously reserved tax assets of $76.1 million. This is the single biggest driver of the favorable development and will be recovered in cash in future periods. We have removed this benefit from our non-GAAP results.","As a result, Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $125 million, up 95.3% from the prior year. First quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.70 compared to $0.45 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 16.9% from last year. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS please see our earnings press release.","Cash flow from operating activities during the three months period ended March 31, 2016, was $0.7 million compared to $65.6 million during the three months period ended March 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to a $56.9 million larger increase in accounts receivables due to stronger revenues in the month of March and payments of approximately $40 million of merger-related transaction fees and integration costs.","Cash provided by investing activities was $504 million favorable, which reflects the assumed cash in the merger with Sirona of $522.3 million. These funds were largely used to execute the $500 million share repurchase which, in exchange, is a major driver behind the $472.8 million cash used in financing activities. The company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $38.5 million to $323.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016.","Now, turning to guidance, for fiscal 2016, we expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%.","At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that growth comps get more difficult in Q2 and Q3 related to last year's record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business.","At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full-year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares. Our share count will increase to 238 million as we move into Q2.","I will now turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Uli. We are in the very early days of our journey as Dentsply Sirona, but we have a lot to be excited about. The key driving force behind our merger was growth. By accelerating the adoption of our products, we can bring about the full impact of digital dentistry in the dental practice. We can integrate equipment and consumables to meet the growing need for more efficient workflows. We will set new standards of care while meeting the growing demand for end-to-end solutions.","At Dentsply Sirona, we are the only company that can further drive these trends and are best positioned to benefit from them. Our installed base of equipment is the largest in the world. Our customers are loyal and supportive. They understand that our products are built to help them become more successful, which is driving our growth.","Every day, around 600,000 dental professionals use Dentsply Sirona product. Our reach is unparallel, and our brands are the most well-known in the industry. Dentsply Sirona is associated with quality and innovation.","We have the broadest clinical education platform in dentistry. Each year, we train more than 300,000 dental professionals on our products. Training builds loyalty to our company and our products, especially when they make procedures easier or more efficient.","We also are able to deliver all of our offerings around the globe with largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry. We are supported by 4,000 sales professionals and around 5,000 distributors around the globe. We also heard combining all of our capabilities create synergy opportunities. From a cost perspective, coming together will create opportunities to leverage our supply chain and cost structure.","Building off the legacy Dentsply efficiency program, we already have a platform to evaluate opportunities and the team to execute on them. We are evaluating ways to improve our processes and manufacture more efficiently. We have begun cutting redundant corporate expenses and consolidating some of our countries. All of these actions will generate tangible cost savings and create a more leverageable cost structure. We expect to achieve these savings while continuing to invest in R&D and our sales and service infrastructure.","With more innovations and farther reach, we can cross sell to our mutual customers or create bundles that specifically cater to each customer. We have been working closely with our distributors to develop plans that create growth opportunities for ourselves and our partners.","Some of these successes involve sales people coming together to move the combined business forward. We already have a number of stories from the field, of reps introducing customers to our expanded portfolio. We have a large sales organization around the globe and they've been meeting to find more ways to collaborate and accelerate growth while working with and respecting a wide range of distributor relationships that we have in place.","These are win-win scenarios for Dentsply Sirona and our distribution partners. The more significant opportunities will require investment in both R&D and infrastructure. While these take time and will mean that some of our revenue synergies are backend loaded to our third year, we are extremely confident that we can deliver them and they will be significant.","While these integrated solutions are in development, our R&D engine is continuing to introduce innovation to drive penetration of our products. We've recently introduced a number of new meaningful products to the market. Our SureFil SDR+ builds on our revolutionary market-leading bulk fill composite platform. The product has enhanced radiopacity in interproximal layer.","In our Healthcare business, the new Navina bowel management system provides a novel approach to irrigation in a rapidly expanding market. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.","During the quarter, we launched our CEREC Zirconia package, which was well received by the market. The Zirconia package includes the new CEREC SpeedFire, our unique high speed sintering furnace and combination with the CEREC chairside CAD\/CAM system. It allows for a single visit dentistry of Zirconia crowns and small bridges. In the past, using conventional furnaces, Zirconia needed about two hours for sintering. Therefore, Zirconia was exclusively processed in the dental lab.","CEREC SpeedFire brings sintering time down to about 15 minutes and opens up the possibility of processing Zirconia chairside. Zirconia is the most popular ceramic material for crowns in the U.S. Having this material available for CEREC will substantially expand the addressable market for CEREC.","In conjunction with our launch, we also introduced CEREC chairside Zirconia blocks and our new Calibra ceramic cement, a first Dentsply Sirona cement to address CAD\/CAM restorations. As part of our launch, we also provided a materials and accessories starter kit for all new users of Zirconia packages.","Combining these new products with our CELTRA Duo blocks means that we can now offer dentists the tools and materials for all of our chairside restorations. And to complement this, we have outstanding relationships with our material partners that we'll continue to build on.","We will continue to invest in new CEREC consumables specialist sales force to work hand-in-hand with our equipment specialists to deliver a full value proposition to dental professionals. They now can source all of their CAD\/CAM needs from Dentsply Sirona. Our efforts are already paying off. Our CELTRA and Zirconia lines are growing rapidly. This is the first example of Dentsply Sirona's leadership in both equipment and consumables coming together to drive growth globally.","We will continue to launch over 30 new products every year. Our new product pipeline is robust. We provide best-in-class equipment and consumables. We can accelerate adoption of technology and drive sales of our entire product portfolio.","We have a number of additional opportunities to quickly integrate our technology and consumable offerings. Orthodontists are rapidly adopting 3D imaging and digital impressioning systems. We have the most open orthodontic camera on the market, and we can benefit from our seamless integration with our own MTM Clear Aligner brands.","Coupled with our brackets and wires, orthodontists can now treat a patient from diagnosis to treatment. From the initial x-ray to impression and then to treatment, orthodontists can choose from an array of Dentsply Sirona products to effectively treat patients. With CEREC meets 3D, we offer the safest and easiest chairside implant planning.","As I mentioned, our implant sales force is already generating leads for imaging and CAD\/CAM and planning joint clinical education events to train doctors on the Dentsply Sirona implants line.","An important part of our clinical education strategy is partnering with dental schools around the globe. In the U.S. Dentsply Sirona products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our Endo business currently partners with 100% of U.S. Endo residency programs. Today, Dentsply Sirona is training the next generation of dentists on products and introducing them to best-in-class solutions. Once they graduate and enter the workforce, they will demand technology and integrated solutions. Dentsply Sirona is the only manufacturer that can meet this growing trend and we will.","To deliver all of our solutions to the market, we'll continue to invest in our sales and service infrastructure. This quarter we built out our infrastructure in Mexico and continued expanding our presence in China and India. While we will leverage our infrastructure to sell more efficiently, we remain focused on accelerating long-term top-line growth.","Overall, I am excited to see the Dentsply Sirona team unite and deliver a strong first quarter. As the dental solutions company, Dentsply Sirona will transform the dental market.","I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona. We are pleased to recognize our distribution partners for helping us achieve our very successful quarter. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our 15,000 employees who work hard each and every day to improve the lives of dentists and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better.","We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Can you hear me okay, guys?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Perfect.","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Great. Congratulations, guys, on a good first quarter here. Jeff, just wanted to start with you and then I have a follow-up for Uli. But I know you've only been in the seat now for a couple months here running the combined companies. But as you put everything together, any sense yet on kind of how you're thinking about the next several years from a top line perspective or maybe from an earnings growth perspective, just how you're seeing the two companies come together?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","New company, same old questions, right? Look, first of all, it is early days and I have to tell you I'm thrilled with what the team's been able to do together. Frankly, one of the nice surprises is to see how talented we are across the globe in sales, marketing, R&D and certainly our functional areas, HR and finance. It's a big deal when two of the largest companies come together to make sure that you have the right cultural fit.","But one thing is for sure that we aligned on is really on our mission, Jeff, which is to empower dental professionals to deliver better, safer and faster dental care. And this idea of end-to-end solutions is where we feel the market is going. So a key fundamental to the merger was growth. So we expect to grow faster in the future. And the reason for that is we're better together to be able to accelerate the adoption of technologies and digital dentistry.","Frankly, when we look at what is possible on the synergy side, as you look at our specialty areas as well as our technology, there's a lot of things that we see early days that are just going to continue to play for us. And, of course, single-visit dentistry is just getting stronger. It's difficult to say if we're at a tipping point yet, but we feel better about that and our ability to work with CAD\/CAM and implant, and ortho certainly gives us a strong feel for our ability to mobilize our synergy opportunities. So there's a lot of genuine excitement here. And I think it's truly great for the dental industry and our distributor partners, because we're going to do a lot of great things together.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Great. And, Uli, maybe my follow-up question. As I look at the EPS guidance over the balance of this year, it looks like it's kind of low-single digits EPS growth. We don't have the pro forma net income, pro forma operating income from last year. But when I mash your two models together and look at kind of the net income, operating income growth this year, it looks like even on a pro forma combined basis this year over last year, it's going to be much higher than that low-single digit. So what am I missing there between the operating income and net income good solid growth and the EPS growth that looks like it's going to come in lower than that over the balance of the year?","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Yes. I think, Jeff, the best way to think about it or to bridge it for you is if we start with Dentsply's stand-alone EPS last year of $2.62, right? And we take the midpoint of our guidance this year, $2.75, so this would be a $0.13 increase, or a 5%, which we will probably refer to as low-single digits, right? Then I told you that we expect FX headwinds of about $0.10, which would add another 4%. And as you know, we've issued Dentsply shares in exchange for Sirona shares. And with the multiple difference we issued, depends on if you look at it trailing or forward-looking, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million, 16 million more shares for the same earnings than had we issued the shares at the same multiple.","So this gives you a diluted impact for the full-year of somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.15 to $0.17, say $0.16 for argument's sake. So that's another 6%. And if you add this up, you look at EPS growth excluding FX and excluding the difference of the multiples on the issuance of about 15%. And if you use this, I think you can back into our earnings growth from there. Does that answer your question?","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. I'll go back and check my math, but that's helpful. Thank you, Uli.","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks. You're welcome.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tyler Harris - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. It's Tyler Harris in for Bob today. It looks like you guys had pretty impressive internal growth rates across the board in the quarter. Can you give us any additional color on specific countries markets growth rates, especially in regards to Europe and Asia Pacific?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So I think we were across the board strong. No question about it. Rest of the world led the way for us. And of course, in the rest of the world, let's start there, a number of those areas are challenged. Japan, of course, is a very important market for us. But it has its challenges, but we continue to perform well. You'll start to hear a theme here, Tyler. China also had some challenges, but very pleased with what the team was able to accomplish there. And even Brazil, which certainly has its challenges, we were able to do particularly well in the consumables area, which is pleasing for us.","We expect the rest of the world to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year. In Europe, we did well. We haven't seen anything really change over the last six months. Frankly, Russia still has some challenges, but I was pleased with how the team was able to perform, especially looking at our pipeline ahead, we have a number of projects there. Southern Europe seems to be picking up for us, albeit it's a low base. Germany performed but did not lead Europe. And then we saw strong growth in both Technologies and Consumables in Europe. But I would caution that our second quarter will be a difficult comp because of IDS last year. And keep in mind that IDS was a record for us.","In the U.S., again, very strong growth led by Technologies and also up operatory consumables. We feel good about what we're able to accomplish. We also see that the U.S. market is improving and the underlying demand for our products are strong.","Tyler Harris - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. The original view was for the deal to be accretive in year one. Now, Jeff, that you've had a little bit more time, not a ton, but a little bit more time to put the companies together and evaluate, as well as evaluate the synergies a little bit more deeply, can you maybe just give us a better sense of what you're seeing as far as the accretion or what your expectation is as far as the accretion will be in 2016, specifically?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, specifically, we're not going to get into that. But we'd say we're not backing off of our being accretive over the first 12 months, absolutely. We see such positive ability to grow together. And, of course, we've had a little headwind that Uli has talked about, but by and large, everything is on track or doing better.","Again, 67 days into this, pleased about how the team has mobilized together. We've certainly got some FX headwinds, and as Uli, I think, did a very nice job earlier talked about the share count headwind as well. But from a standpoint of growth in this market 4% to 6%, we think is leading the way. And we feel good about our prospects for the rest of 2016. And we started our year with a very solid quarter. So I think we're in a good place, Bob.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Got it. And then I guess just one specific one on the Technology segment. Really nice growth there in the quarter. Was wondering if you could comment on the sales of CAD\/CAM specifically? As your channel partner in North America had talked about carrying a higher level of inventory coming into this year, I'm just trying to get a balance between what may be they're holding versus what the end-market's really doing. Any comments around that will be very helpful.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, certainly, Technology led the way at 6.5% for the quarter and certainly was leading the way in the U.S. as well, and that was led by CAD\/CAM. And so the proposition has not changed with regard to us believing that along with Patterson that CEREC will become a standard-of-care, and we're on the appropriate trajectory for that. Keep in mind also that we launched the new Zirconia Blocks, but more critical to that was our SpeedFire. So there was a lot of interests ahead of that, and I think that it's a situation where we've got a lot of opportunities for CEREC in North America and we'll continue to. Uli, do you want to comment...","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","No, thank you. You mentioned it with the launch of the SpeedFire, I think people geared up to be ready to deliver, right? And we had a really good growth in CAD\/CAM. I think there was nothing to be ashamed of, right? Very solid growth.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, I agree. Thanks so much for the comments.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. You're welcome.","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Robbie Fatta in for John today. Thanks for taking the question. As we think about the new segment structure, is there any additional detail you'll be giving going forward on some of the sub-segments? I know we just talked about CAD\/CAM a little bit, but imaging or implants or any of the traditional sub-segments that we used to get more detail on, will we be getting any going forward?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we'll certainly give you color for how they performed and certainly talk about new products. The idea is we spent a lot of time thinking about how best to structure our organization, how could it be most meaningful for our organization to grow, to create value, to be able to untap both cost and revenue synergies. And so that structure also means that when you look at our overall business that there isn't any business that is really more than 15%. So going down to our smallest, which is instruments. So we're trying to get people focused on Technology and Consumable, but certainly we'll deal with the strategic business units within it. You had mentioned imaging. Imaging had a solid quarter and grew above the technology average. It was across all regions. So it was pretty strong growth.","Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And if we could just focus on implants for a second then. Can you give us a sense what the growth was for that in the quarter? And then maybe our sense is that the potential synergies that you could generate is pretty big and the implant group's maybe the biggest out all of them. Is that a fair...","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let's start with that, because I think that is absolutely an on-point comment. We think implant is a strategic fulcrum for us. We see how it relates to both our CAD\/CAM and imaging business. We believe we are well positioned with our product offerings there. We think this is a category that will continue to grow. We have certainly a strong product offering there. When you couple that with CEREC, ATLANTIS, SIMPLANT and ISUS, it's a robust offering.","Rest of the world did better for us there. We were pleased to see the volume come up, pick up a bit for us there. We saw some challenges in Europe, and certainly a market that we're very excited about that we think we can do a lot more in is in the U.S. Chris, you want to make a few more comments?","Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies","Yes. Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. I think I agree with all of those comments. I think this is one where both parties came with very significant and meaningful assets to come together. If you think about, again, the implant is going digital. Obviously, we have the CEREC, we have all the imaging coming from the Sirona side, we've got the ATLANTIS, SIMPLANT, ISUS coming from the Dentsply side.","And I would say, I'm very pleased with how these teams have come together, both from a standpoint of longer term or middle term, if you will, as well product synergies. But in addition to that, some nearer-term opportunities in terms of lead sharing, KOL sharing, et cetera, that, again, there's a lot of excitement, a lot of movement and a lot of energy. And, again, as Jeff mentioned, we've got expectations here that this really does accelerate implant growth rate and also, frankly, helps imaging and CAD\/CAM over time as well.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. When you just think about the clinical education, the engagement of our KOLs, the possibility of what we're able to do together with our technologies and in implant are pretty substantial.","Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS.","Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Vik in for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a couple over here. So can you help us understand the puts and takes on gross margin? I know you had mentioned FX in your global efficiency programs. Anything in particular on product mix, for example? And then how should we think about gross margin for 2016? And anything in particular we should keep in mind over the next three quarters?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me start and then I'll hand it over to Uli on that. But you need to understand that product mix and regional mix can have a significant impact in any quarter. But now that we talk about our businesses, no business being greater than 15% coming all the way down to 3%, it should take some of that lumpiness out of it. But, nevertheless, in the quarter, it can have the impact of more than 75 basis points, over 100 basis points, depending on the mix. So mix does play a role, no question about it. But the way to start to think about that is how we talk about how the consumables or the technology businesses grew in the quarter. That's the first thing you need to think about. But we're trying to also get you focused on our operating income, which we think is a better lever to understand our businesses. But go ahead.","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Yes. I think, if you look at our margins in Q1, we provided you with the rec tables. I talked a little bit on the prepared remarks on the GAAP versus non-GAAP items. So, I think, what you see on the rec table is the margin a little bit over 60% reported for the first quarter after these adjustments.","I did mention that the fact that Sirona has a very strong margin. We only consolidated one month of Sirona, pronounced a little bit the benefit of the merger. So that also helped the gross profit margins. They were probably a tad higher in this recording than they would have been on the complete month. I also said this on the remark to operating margins. And the other thing to think about is the exchange rates. We're now at $1.14. The first quarter was a little bit lower. So that will hurt our gross profit margins, especially on the Technology segment, literally almost all of our manufacturing is euros, Swiss franc or Swedish krona based, right? So, for the full year I would expect them to be quite a bit lower than the 60% we saw in Q1. Again, due to FX and due to the fact that we will not always only have the best month of the quarter in the numbers.","Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just one more, if I could. Can you give us a sense of some of the areas that you're monitoring that could potentially put you at either the bottom or the top end of your guidance beyond what you've seen in a very strong first quarter? Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the way to think about it is the markets continue to hold up. We continue to see that our early wins on our revenue synergies accelerate faster than we had expected. We certainly have some tough comps ahead of us on Q2 and Q3. So how we are able to execute in those quarters will have a lot to do with the ability to go beyond. But, of course, as we were just talking about, the impact from sales and margin mix will play a big role in that.","Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. Maybe, Jeff, just the first one for you, the balance sheet is, obviously, very strong. You completed the $500 million share repo. I think you're still only in and around one times levered debt-to-EBITDA. So just maybe at a high level, if you can talk about the company's ability to do acquisitions, even small ones, over the next 12 months or so, and I'm asking more from the capabilities around an integration standpoint, obviously, more so than financial.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Okay. First of all, let me tell you one of the truly gems of Dentsply Sirona is our business development team. We have exceptionally capable people there that can process and digest a lot. The fact that we've been working at the global efficiency and now have a formalized integration office to deal with this puts us in better stead. We know which countries are the most stable and ones that it might be a little bit longer away to contemplate a M&A position there.","But by and large, I will tell you that our strategic plan is all about continuing to do acquisitions. It's day 67 and I can tell you we are right up to speed on what the possibilities are to go out there. Of course, when you are in the midst of this type of transformational merger, you do take into consideration your ability to integrate and how quickly we'd be able to do it. So that's all part and parcel for that. But from the standpoint of myself, the management team and the board, we believe we've got a lot of room that can grow through acquisition.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Very helpful. And just one more quick one for you, Uli. I don't believe the $2.70 to $2.80, I don't think that assumes much more in the way of share repos done this year. So can you just talk about that a little bit? If you guys go ahead and do incremental share repurchases, should we view that as marginal upsides to the $2.70 to $2.80? Thanks, guys.","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Yes. I think we told you that our guidance is based on a share count range of 220 million to 225 million. And as we leave Q1 and if our share price doesn't change anymore, because this has an impact of the diluted part of the options, we would end up the year about in the middle of what we told you, around 223 million shares. We gave you the range, because we still have an authorization left. We have about $3.6 million left on our buyback authorization. We do intend to execute on this. Timing depends on the availability of our cash flow and our other plans. So it does include the possibility that we buy back a bit more in the course of the year.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jon.","Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","You're welcome, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Nice to have the gang back together here. First question is on synergies. Jeff, you reiterated the $125 million by year three that you laid out with Bret in the call last September. It'd be helpful just to hear at a high level how your thinking around the $125 million is evolving and then how you think about the pacing. You mentioned in a prior comment that you see the sales piece of that as a little bit more back-half loaded. Could you comment on the cost piece of that as well?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I would say that we've already started on some of the cost. Cost is easier to identify, and you can go at it a little bit quicker. Certain corporate costs we've evaluated and come after insurance audit fees. The other thing is when you're doing country consolidations, there are overlaps with regard to software and duplication in functionality and functions. And, certainly, also from a sourcing perspective, we are at that, there are some quick wins that we've been able to talk about.","But equally, I think, we've spent a lot of time with our team. And, in a moment, I'm going to have Chris talk to you a little about that, because he's been leading the way with revenue synergies, and we're really pleased to see how well the teams have come together to collaborate. Again, keep in mind it's day 67, but the type of wins that we're talking about that make sense for the dental practitioner, for our distribution partners, for Dentsply Sirona are really coming up.","From a perspective of the three years, the $125 million. Again, we're not backing away from that. We're very confident about it. But to give more color at this time about what we'll map in as far as year two and year three, I don't think we're \u2013 well, I know we're not going to talk about that today, Steve. But we tried, in my prepared remarks, to really give you a lot of things that we're working on that will have a big impact. Chris?","Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies","Yes. I guess, Steve, I'd characterize it is follows. As I mentioned on the implants discussion that there's a lot of energy here and that's true, frankly, for all of the different work streams that we have going and these are numerous. You should think about the work streams really being both within the two segments and then across the two segments as well.","You should think about them being focused on product synergies, again, being probably more a little \u2013 think of that a little bit more innovation-based or R&D-based. There are some that are probably intermediate term, some longer-term. But again, those are probably going to be on the tail-end, if you will, or at least the back half of the three-year period. Some may be a little bit before then. And a lot of energy going there, again, when we get our scientists together, when we get our marketers together, and really think about the possibilities in terms of combined solutions.","On the other hand then, in the nearer term, on the commercial synergies think about, again, our sales and marketers getting together and talking about programmatically what can we do to drive more value with our customers together. And, again, you can think about that in terms of promotions, in terms of how we present ourselves to our customers, in terms of, as I mentioned earlier, KOLs, clinical education, et cetera. And so, again, there's a lot of energy, many, many work streams here. But, again, we're excited about how our people are engaging. And I think that bodes well for the trajectory and where we head, frankly, not just this year but over the three-year period and beyond.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, digital dentistry, clinical education, if you just, Steve, think about how many trainings and educations we do where we never had any of our products also in the room when you're doing a training on ortho, implant, endo, where that can play in. And it works both ways. And, certainly, nobody's done better than Dentsply Sirona in clinical education, and that is valued highly by the dental professional.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for all that color. Just one follow-up, actually, to a comment that you made earlier, Jeff, the language you used was something to the effect of our corporate strategy is all about M&A. I can't say it's a terribly surprising comment, but it would help given that comment and context to hear how you and the rest of the board think about your priorities and commitments around M&A, how do you think about the returns that you would require and what sort of strategic imperatives are you really trying to address there on the street? Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, look, this is certainly from a standpoint of the bigger picture what we look at. We are first and foremost a innovator, right? And so, technology matters, so we're out there, we're looking at businesses that maybe need a larger company infrastructure. They've got something that they're either just finished with or they need more resources to finish that, that's something that's very important, something both companies have done extremely well.","And then, we take a look at what can we add to our SBUs? What would be a additional add-on that would help growth or the adoption of the technology or sell more of the consumables certainly. And let's not forget the regional play which is why I said we have to look at each country within the stability level there.","Certainly, again, we look for the acquisition to be accretive. And if it's not going to be accretive, we've got to be able to explain to you very quickly why this will get there in a fast enough form that is necessary. ROIC has always been something that is significant to us and hasn't changed. I think we have a very robust process internally that we go through.","Frankly, I wanted to highlight it earlier because I think the team's truly extraordinary. And that was something that I can tell you from a standpoint at Sirona, we were good, Dentsply is great. And so, coming together on that makes a big difference. Also, we've been able to have discussions with our board about that. We recognize that capital allocation is a critical component. We think that we're one of the few companies that can be a true consolidator in this industry. And so, there's a lot of room for that to take place over the years to come.","And as you know, like anything, you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it becomes available. And I think that's the point that we want to stress. Yes, we have to integrate. Yes, we understand that priority. And our 15,000 know our first and foremost is to them and to our shareholders and stakeholders to make sure our nucleus is strong but after that, we just see plenty of opportunities. Now, we're going to stay disciplined. That doesn't change. But that's part of our roadmap. And I want to be crystal clear about that.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. I want to go back to one of the questions earlier on CAD\/CAM. I understand you guys don't want to give numbers for the quarter. But I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about underlying market growth for that market. You've got a number of dynamics here with the Zirconia workflow and obviously, some of your competitors. So, can you maybe just talk about how you see the growth trajectory for CAD\/CAM for the next couple of years?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Tycho. Nice to hear from you. I mean, look we did give color that CAD\/CAM led technology grew faster than the overall technology. And that's because single-visit dentistry is here to stay. You're hearing it more and more. In ortho, it's growing the fastest, I would say, around the globe. But you won't hear from the dental community or distribution a disagreement about chair side becoming the standard of care. We've heard more about digital impression only but that's typically in ortho. And, of course, our Zirconia, it's really a game changer. When you think about this material and the strength of it, and also the aesthetics and how it compares to others, typically, Zirconia has been something that you would only do through the lab and of course, our Cercon ht is a product that we're excited about that will deliver through the lab as well. But from a chair side perspective, you never considered it because it took two hours to sinter. Now, with the SpeedFire, it's 15 minutes.","Why is this so significant? Because Zirconia is a terrific material for molars and certain bridges and actually very popular amongst dentists. And so, to be able to have this type of ceramic be available at chair side just truly opens up our addressable market. And by addressable market, we're not talking about adding 2,000 or 3,000 more dentists who are interested. We're talking about tens of thousands of dentists that will now take a look at this opportunity where they wouldn't have before. So, we believe that's just another reason why CEREC makes sense.","But the other thing, frankly, is the fact that, now, everybody is talking about not just restorative, but we're talking about what you can do with CEREC on an implant and ortho side. And I have to say that we were at the AAO and in a second I'm going to ask Chris to tell you about that flavor. But you just see the appetite for digital impression and what the possibilities are for all types of applications. And I think that was a bit of the story at the AAO.","Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies","Absolutely, Jeff. I mean, there's no doubt that a lot of energy regarding digital at the orthodontic show. Obviously, we're there and well positioned with the Omnicam. And, again, I think that as we look at the synergies of these companies coming together, there's no doubt that similar to implants, ortho is really one of the key fulcrums and one of the key opportunities. So, we're excited about that. I think that we're well positioned for where this market is headed. And, again, I think that really, as we move forward, I would expect that to be one of the key synergies.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, it's a beautiful thing that the ortho to be the most open and also to have a clear aligner in our MTM for the anterior, which is exciting for us.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","And there are no further telephone questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you very much for joining us on our first ever first quarter conference call as Dentsply Sirona. Very excited what we have ahead of us. Our 15,000 strong are ready to go and have another strong quarter in Q2. So, I look forward to joining you in August to discuss our second quarter results.

Sir, you may now begin.","Derek Leckow ","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results. ","I'm here with Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and CFO; and Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President and COO. We will have some prepared remarks and then we have allocated the balance of our time for your questions. ","I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. I'd like to point out that a copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides and the Regulation G information regarding non-GAAP financials are available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.dentsply.com under the heading Events and Presentations.

We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make today.","The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website. ","With that I'd now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret W. Wise","Thank you, Derek. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us here on our year-end call. As Derek noted I have some opening comments about the market and our performance, then I am going to turn the call over to Jim for an update on operational topics and then Chris will provide a deeper dive on our results. ","I'd like to begin by putting some context around overall performance for 2013. We came into the year expecting or hoping perhaps that the global dental market would continue to accelerate as we moved through the year. At the same time we had several that we needed to execute, including numerous new product launches to come out in the year, completing the sales and marketing integration of our implant business and continuing the recovery of our orthodontics business.","As the year progressed it became clear that the market acceleration that we had expected or hoped for would not materialize, particularly in Europe and this created a barrier to hitting our growth goals for the year. Despite this we are pleased with our ability to execute on operating margin expansion, again overcoming the slow sales environment in Europe; we had some major headwinds from currency in that regard and also the Medical Device Tax that was implemented in the U.S.","On the implant integration, we completed the combination of the marketing units as planned but really encountered much more disruption than anticipated in Germany. In orthodontics our recovery progressed in what has become a very competitive and in many ways a disrupted market. All told we accomplished several key goals last year including growing cash flow generation but we fell short of our initial growth objectives at the start of the year. ","On our actual results we finished the year at just under $3 billion in revenue, growth was lower than our long-term trend line due in-part to the slow conditions I mentioned in Europe but also due to the company specific matters that I also alluded to a moment ago. Gross ex PM came in at a positive 2.1% for the year and that comprised of constant currency growth of 2% with currency translation essentially being unchanged on a net basis across all our countries.","Internal growth for 2013 was positive 1.9% and that was comprised of positive growth in each of our geographic regions, the highest in the U.S. at a positive 3.8% while Europe was positive 0.2% and rest of world came in at positive 2.7%. On the 2.1% top line growth, we had adjusted earnings per share growth of a positive 5.9% that\u2019s on stable to slightly improving operating margins and again that overcame this slower growth and the headwinds we had in Europe. This 5.9% earnings gain came on top of a 9.4% gain in 2012.","Shifting to fourth quarter, total growth [XTM] was a positive 1.5% with our internal growth a positive 0.8% and constant currency growth was a positive 1.1% and that's against a pretty difficult comp of internal growth last year in the fourth quarter of positive 5.9%. ","In U.S. we had internal growth of 2.5%; up against the 5.9% comp in the prior year and rest of world we had internal growth of 2.5% against a 12.1% comp in the fourth quarter 2012. Europe had a negative 1.1% internal growth in the quarter but absent the German implant business where we had a tough comp because we are coming up against the pre-integration period last year. So absent the German implant business the European business was up low single-digits. On the 1.5% top line growth in the quarter, adjusted EPS was up 9% and that's on top of a 10% gain last year in the fourth quarter.","There are several moving parts in the quarter and Chris is going to cover those in more detail, but overall, I think this was a good earnings outcome even after considering a lower tax rate which mostly offset currency headwinds and again Chris will give you more of those details.","On market conditions, the U.S. market at retail was probably growing low single-digits in Q4 while we believe Europe was down slightly. In the U.S. our expectation is that economic growth should continue to accelerate in 2014 and the dental market should also pick up probably in the range of 100 basis points normalized for the impacts on the base line for the device tax in the U.S.","I would like to add that we have seen some weakness in U.S. early in 2014, which may be attributable to some pretty severe weather in the Midwest and East Coast and of course we hope that, that will level out over the coming months or over the first half of the year. In Europe, there's some interesting data points including some stability or even growth late in 2013 in the Southern countries of Europe which of course is an encouraging sign and we haven't seen for some time. Overall we are expecting dental markets to accelerate in EU also by about a 100 basis points or perhaps a little bit more in 2014.","In the rest of world territories for us, currency weakness is a major barrier present with numerous markets in those categories suffering material devaluations versus U.S. dollar euro and Swiss currency. As our rest of world territory is a generally import markets we view this as a risk and thus we are not expecting any significant acceleration in these markets overall in 2014.","Our building blocks for 2014 takes these market conditions into accounts but also a pretty solid innovation pipeline that we have coming into the year and of course an improved capital structure over what we had a year ago. We are also very focused on improving operating leverage of our business and generating operating margin expansion, improved asset turns and cash flow. Likewise we are also mindful of the headwinds we face from currency impacts for the next year. ","Based on these factors in the aggregate we are targeting adjusted earnings in the range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share for 2014 and we view this as a reasonable expectation given the points I have noted here.","I would like to now turn the call over to Jim for an update on some of our operational matters including innovation pipeline. Jim?","James G. Mosch","Thank you, Bret. I would like to comment on a few operational items and then turn it over to Chris for the financial review. Overall our primary objectives in operations have been on scientific research in combination with strong clinical evidence which supports our commercialization of innovation. Ultimately this drives better patient outcomes and clinical efficiency. In 2013 we made a good progress on this objective and I am confident that our pipeline will drive continued commercial success in 2014. ","Our close secondary objective has been on improving our operating platform to allow for margin expansion, even in small growth environments. I have a few brief comments on both of these areas. ","Overall the businesses have been focusing on commercializing some key internally developed innovations, innovations in the chair side of consumable category with new composite products such as TPH Spectra is gaining market share in the large composite category. With two new innovations in this area SDR which is the Bulk Fill restorative and now TPH Spectra, we have a competitive portfolio with clear procedural advantages. ","In other restorative categories we launched AquasilUltra Cordless in Q4. We are gaining momentum in this new category which simplifies the restorative procedure by eliminating use of a retraction cord. We also entered the large and growing Fluoride varnish category by launching both a white and clear varnish solution and went from absent in this space to a proud number share position in one year. ","Outside of our internal development we did a complete a small transaction to support our consumables business in late 2013 with the acquisition of Triodent, a New Zealand-based manufacturer of a line of restorative dental consumables. Triodent is known for its innovative and patented sectional matrix system which has been well accepted by clinicians globally and is very complementary for procedures involving key restorative products such as our SDR.","Success in the dental specialty segment is also heavily dependent on innovation and I am pleased with our pipeline. Recent examples include the continued success of our endodontics portfolio providing comprehensive state-of-the-art solutions for root canal therapy. Over the past three years we have changed the game in the specialty with newly introduced reciprocating file systems, WaveOne and Reciproc which offered the potential of one file endodontics. These solutions combined with GuttaCore, a non-carrier based dermal filling material provides superior obturation and greatly enhances the ease and efficiency of endodontics. ","In addition last year we introduced ProTaper NEXT the next generation of rotary endodontics providing superior flexibility, improved cleaning and shaping and a unique patented swaggering motion which ensures that the file maintains root canal integrity. ","Clinicians can feel this difference with the file and we are having good commercial success and positive feedback from leading global opinion leaders. These are just a few quick examples of innovation in our pipeline. Overall, I feel good about our forward looking pipeline and our ability to bring innovations in the marketplace in each of our product portfolios. ","In regards to our implant business we are now two years plus from the acquisition and with the last of 19 subsidiaries fully integrated in early 2013, the integration from a high level is complete. Our focus has now turned to business effectiveness, new product development, executing our market strategy and continuing to drive synergies. We have executed well on our synergies, despite market related headwinds. ","We have made good progress with the CNC insourcing of Astra Tech implants, we are on schedule and completed 50% of our insourcing in 2013 and expect to complete 90% of our insourcing plan by the end of 2014. Overall I think we have made good progress in positioning this business for strong earnings leverage as the market environment recovers and begin to grow.","Lastly I would like to add that we have been focused on how to better leverage our cost structure so that we can expand operating margins even in lower growth environments. This has included leveraging manufacturing assets as well as maximizing the leverage of our related overhead structure. We were pleased to see operating margin expansion in 2013 despite the slow environment in Europe and the implementation of the medical device tax in U.S. Our early success in this effort is encouraging and I see room for meaningful improvement going forward. ","With I would like to turn it over to Chris Clark. Chris?","Christopher T. Clark","Thank you, Jim good morning everyone. I would like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and also our full year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also providing some additional color on both the balance sheet and cash flow. ","For the fourth quarter, sales excluding precious metals grew 1.5% compared to prior year, including 80 basis points of internal growth, 30 basis point benefit from recent acquisitions and favorable currency translation of 40 basis points. ","Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 56.5% of sales excluding precious metals, which was an improvement of 20 basis points versus prior year despite the negative headwind of between 40 and 50 basis points from a medical device excise tax in the U.S. as we've mentioned precociously.","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.3% of sales excluding precious metals in the quarter, identical to our rate in the fourth quarter 2012. Operating margins for the quarter improved by 10 basis points to 17.2% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis compared to 17.1% in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting the gross margin and SG&A impact I just described. Overall we are pleased to deliver some operating margin expansion in a low growth environment despite the headwind we faced from currency and to a lesser extent the medical device tax. ","Currency represented a significant headwind to earnings in the quarter of slightly over $0.03 per year, due largely to the significant weakening of the currencies in Canada Russia, Australia, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. As those currencies weaken our cost of products in local currency rises, creating gross profit headwinds as we import goods into these markets from the U.S. and from Europe. ","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.3% while our operating tax rate was 20.8% in the quarter which represented a 130 basis point improvement compared to our average rate for the first three quarters of the year and a 350 basis point improvement over the operating rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 or about $0.03 per share impact. This improvement in rate basically offset the currency headwind we experienced in operating income that I previously mentioned. ","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter was $74.4 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared to $126.8 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. These results include a number of items which we listed in the schedules in the release including an exceptionally large one-time tax benefit in 2012. ","On an adjusted basis net earnings grew to $87.9 million from $81.4 million in the prior year quarter and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9% to $0.61 per diluted share. Of course this 9% EPS growth rate includes the offsetting impacts or currency impacts as I described earlier. ","Transitioning now to full year 2013, sales excluding precious metals grew by 2.1% compared to prior year, including 1.9% internal growth and a 10 basis point tailwind from both acquisitions and currency translation. As Bret indicated our U.S. internal growth for the year was 3.8% which we believe to be stronger than underlying market growth. ","European internal growth was positive 0.2% in a flat to down market while internal growth in the rest of the world regions was 2.7%. Internal growth within the developed countries in this region was flat for the year in aggregate. And on the other hand our global internal growth rate for the emerging markets was mid to upper single digits for the year. ","For the year the U.S. comprised 34% of our global sales while Europe represented 45% and the rest of the world region, 21%. Gross profit on an adjusted basis for 2013 was 57.4% of sales, excluding precious metals which was a decline of 50 basis points versus last year's 57.9%. Again we had to meet the negative headwind of approximately 40 to 50 basis points from medical device excise tax in the U.S. ","SG&A expenses on adjusted basis were 39.8% of sales excluding precious metals, that's an improvement of 70 basis points compared to last year's 40.5% and reflects the impact of our cost reduction and integration efforts. You will notice that restructuring and other costs totaled $13 million for the year and including just over $8 million for the fourth quarter primarily for investments we've made to realize these synergies and efficiencies. ","Operating margin for the year improved by 10 basis points to 17.6% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis compared to 17.5% last year. And again in delivering this modest improvement we had to overcome both the currency issues and the medical device tax, so we are generally pleased with our operating leverage in the business that is generating under really slower than ideal market growth conditions. ","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as average reported basis for 2013 was $313.2 million or $2.16 per diluted share compared to $314.2 million or $2.18 per diluted share in 2012. These results also include a number of items which we have listed in the schedules in the release including the exceptionally large one-time cash benefit in 2012 that I mentioned earlier."," ","On an adjusted basis, net earnings of grew to $341.2 million from $319.2 million in 2012, and adjusted earnings per share grew 6% to $2.35 per diluted share from $2.22 per diluted share in 2012. Our results for the year include a negative impact from currency of between $0.05 and $0.06 per share due to the factors I described earlier. This was offset by favorability in our operating tax rate in 2013. We see some upward pressure on our tax rate going into 2014 which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. ","Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the year was a record $417.8 million, that\u2019s up 13% from $369.7 million last year. And this, the improvement largely reflects latent cash and tax benefits associated with recent acquisitions. Our cash flow performance allowed us to take a more balanced approach to capital deployment as we moved through the year including reducing our net debt-to-capital ratio from 39% at the beginning of the year and 51% immediately following the Astra Tech acquisition in August 2011 to 35.2% as of December 2013. ","In addition we announced the acquisitions of the Triodent and QAHR businesses in November. And finally we were also increasingly active in repurchasing shares to offset dilution from equity plans. And we repurchased just under a 1 million shares in the fourth quarter at an average cost of $47.65 per share. For the full year the company repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares. ","Inventories now stand at a 114 days which is down five days compared to September and up eight days compared to December 2012. As we mentioned previously we have strategically increased inventory in few a businesses as part of the transition plans associated with the anticipating operating changes. We anticipate that inventory may continue to increase slightly through mid-year to support these efforts before returning to more normal levels as we move through 2014 and 2015. ","Accounts receivable days were 56 days as the end of December, down eight days from prior quarter and up three days compared to December 2012. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $100 million for the quarter consistent with our most recent projections. Depreciation was $82 million for the year while amortization was $46 million. ","Finally as Bret stated, we\u2019re establishing our 2014 earnings per share guidance at $2.45 to $2.55 on a net adjusted basis. Our guidance reflects the impact of the incremental currency headwind of approximately $0.04 per share largely due to the weakening of the second tier currencies I mentioned earlier. In addition we currently anticipate an operating tax rate for 2014 that will be in the range of 22.5% to 23%, which represents an earnings headwind of up to $0.05 per share compared to our 2013 rate of 21.7%. There may be some opportunity to improve on this as we move through the year so we\u2019ll have to see. ","Our guidance reflects the anticipated impact of both of these items as well as our assessment of continued above market performance and a modest strengthening of market conditions. That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support and we\u2019ll be now glad to answer any questions you might ask. ","Question-and-Answer-Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instruction). And we will take our first question from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Thanks guys. Can you hear me okay?","Bret W. Wise ","Yeah, hear you fine.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Sorry I am in an airport so sorry for the background noise. But wanted to start first just on couple of your specialty businesses and end of [inaudible] plants, if you could at all give me any insight kind of where do you expect share to go this year, I think we feel like those markets could grow low to mid-single digit this year. But where do you think you share specifically in those two markets could go this year? ","Bret W. Wise","","I\u2019m going to answer that in part of that. And then I\u2019m going to ask Jim talk about maybe some technologies that we have in the market or coming. I think that 2013 was a pretty disruptive year for our implant business. We did complete the integration in the largest country for that business which was Germany, but also Japan. I think the business is now very focused on creating the kind of competitive advantage that it needs to invest. I\u2019m hopeful that we can start to grow share there again as well. ","On other things in the specialty business we've got orthodontics which is still in a recovery mode. We've recovered some of the lost share that we had following the disruption in Japan. But I think I've commented earlier in the year in several cases that, that's a very competitive market right now with us trying to edge our way back in and the competitors trying to defend their market share. I think that we will continue to take some market share back in that category. It's just a question of how fast we can take it back. ","In endodontics that's a business is very much driven by innovation. We've brought out some kind of game changing innovation over the past few years that have allowed us to grow share in that marketplace and we've got some pretty interesting things in the pipeline. So that's a market I think we continue to have some competitive advantage in. Jim do you have anything to add on those?","James G. Mosch ","Yeah, absolutely. Jeff I think from a standpoint of the implant business, as we've mentioned we are now eclipsing two years. Now I think what's probably happened more than anything is this business has really stabilized and moved beyond the integration. And we can just see the activity level and the focus and the competency at our field level really around the world. And I think that's really proving that I think our business strategy is sound and this organization is performing at a much better level. ","At the same point in time we've done some things from the standpoint of how we improve that business model. We've done some consolidation of our ES Healthcare and our materialized dental business into Atlantis. Those products are now -- you are able to order those via Atlantis, order at least the ES products. We are manufacturing bars and bridges in Atlantis and we are integrating the guided surgery products with the Atlantis product. ","So we are seeing some real opportunity to offer a lot of value to our customers and we believe that this along with some product innovations in the implant area will help us to move forward. As it relates to endo as Bret said we've launched a lot of new products over the last couple of years, products like WaveOne or Reciproc, ProTaper NEXT. ","And I think what I would emphasize about these products versus traditional products is that what they really do is they simplify and expedite the endodontics procedure. They reduce the number of files used, they allow the clinicians to get a high quality result in less time. And those have been extremely well received in the marketplace. And even though we have had successes with those launches in the last year we continue to see a share gain as a result. ","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Great, that's helpful, thanks Jim. And Bret I guess one last question for you just on a high level, it's been a few years since we've seen any kind of double-digit EPS growth. How do you guys -- it sounds now in 2014 cash and currency will probably create a little more impact than I think any of us were expecting. But where do you think fundamentally if general markets can get back to maybe 3% to 5% growth, knowing where you are at in the different business lines and all that, what do you think fundamentally is your longer term EPS growth potential as we cycle thorough maybe some of these macro issues and what have you? ","Bret W. Wise ","Well I think the fundamentals about the general market and the competitive position that we have has not really changed, meaning if we can see these markets will return to kind of pre-recession levels with call it a 4% to 6% growth for the marketplaces then our business model is in really good shape to get the kind of operating leverage that we've historically gotten. So I think in and you throw on top of that some earnings gains from redeploying the cash that we generate I think those kind of earnings gains long-term are clearly possible and of course in those environments we would be striving to hit those. ","In the current environment we have a U.S market that's growing low single-digits, we have a European markets that's probably, I mean realistically it's probably just flat. We are kind of expecting that both the U.S and European markets are going to accelerate by about a 100 basis points maybe a little bit more in Europe this year, although even with those accelerations gets us back to the longer-term trend line. ","So we are pleased that even in a tough environment this year with currency headwinds, device tax, this, that and the other things we still grew operating margin a little bit. I think we've been working very hard to get our cost structure in place. That will allow us to have the kind of earnings leverage that maybe we saw historically if we get back to a market that can grow in that 4% range and we can grow a little bit faster in that through innovation and so forth. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for taking the questions. First of all I wonder if Bret and maybe Jim if you could spend another minute on the impact of the weather that you called out, clearly a U.S. centric issue. How much of the impact of weather would you say that came along in the fourth quarter, how much are you embedding in your expectations for the first quarter and in which areas of the business might be more and less weather sensitive?","Bret W. Wise","","Well, let me take a shot at that. This is always difficult because we don't really have great data on what's happens in the general obturatory when we have a blizzard or we have ice storm et cetera. But I will say that, the weather that we had just mainly first quarter issue not a fourth quarter issue but weather that we had on East Coast and to a lesser degree in the Midwest in January and early part of February was pretty severe. I mean, we had probably the economy shutdown for 90 plus million people at some point due to these recent storms, and that does have an impact on dentistry because the obturatory is closed. So dentistry doesn't get done during that period of time.","The data points that we have is, we looked at growth in the various regions throughout the world, excuse me not throughout the world throughout the country and compared them, the ones that were weather related to the ones that weren't weather related and there is a pretty divergence in growth here early in the year. ","Now hopefully because dental ailments don't stop, correct they keep getting worst hopefully that will level out over the next few months and people that had their appointments canceled or canceled their appointments because of weather end up back in the dental obturatory later because those same ailments corrected.","So to us it looks like a temporary thing. It was pretty notable in the first let's say five weeks of the year and again we are hoping that will level out as we move through the year.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley"," ","Thanks, that very helpful. And one quickly on SG&A, Jim just falling up on your comments in the prepared remarks, the SG&A for 2013 was straightly remarkable, keeping it fairly flat in dollar terms. Can you give us any color on what you are expecting in terms of SG&A growth? Is that a re-acceleration in 2014 and may be along the same lines, speak to how much runway there is in terms of the cost control efforts that you have implemented thus far? Thanks so much.","Christopher T. Clark","","Yeah, Steve it's Chris. I will take that. In short, we are pretty pleased with the SG&A leverage we were able to generate and as mentioned and as Jim mentioned and I think I mentioned as well in our comment that has been a clear focus strategy for us. Obviously, on the integration efforts but also frankly in terms of our base businesses as well and again we do believe that as a lower growth environments we need to focus a little bit more on manufacturing operating margin improvements.","We try to obviously focus the business and the businesses have been focused heavily on doing that. We are pleased with the performance they delivered on that in 2013. As we move to 2014, we would expect to get some additional leverage. So say with some of the structural moves we made later in the year. I mentioned the restructuring charges and that's not atypical for us. I mean as we move throughout the and typically move forward, as we identify opportunities to make the business more efficient we will take restructuring charges from time-to-time. ","So I think we would expect to continue to able to get some improvement on the SG&A line moving forward. I am not going to speculate in the context of what the ratio may be but we typically do record SG&A rates to grow basically below what the sales growth rates are and we are pleased with the ability to do that in '13.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley"," ","Okay. Thanks everyone. I'll see you in Chicago.","Bret W. Wise","","Thanks","Operator","And we will take our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs","","Thanks for the questions. I was hoping if you guys can share a little more on your assumptions relative to 2014 guidance around capital deployment specifically. You guys have done nice job of getting the debt ratios back to a more normal level. And pre-Astra Tech I know buyback were certainly a bigger part of the EPS growth story. Is there anything you can share with us on how you are thinking about capital deployment and repurchases specifically in 2014?","Christopher T. Clark","","Sure, Robert. This is Chris. I'll take a stab at that as well. I think we have been commenting on recent calls about the fact that we're really trying to take a far more balanced approach to capital deployment. We think that we will be de-leveraged now to a position which really allows us to do that, and I think that's certainly our expectation as we move through 2014. ","Specifically relative to share count we certainly don't anticipate shares to be the headwind they were year-on-year in 2013, if anything that going to be a little bit of help. On top of that, obviously, we did some acquisitions that can give us a little bit of a lift here next year and we expect some modest accretion from that particularly the largest one being internalization of kind of minority interest line that we are internalizing that into the base business if you will as we move through 2014. ","So I think that you continue to see us through to balanced approach relative to some share buybacks again a little bit of a lift may be from that, but also focusing on acquisitions also deleveraging a little bit as well. ","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs","So I guess just because the last couple of years haven't really been a normal buyback year is there any just range you can give us if we think pre- Astra Tech is it fair to think of $150 millionish as a level that you guys are comfortable with executing against the debt ratios or like you said more stable? ","Christopher T. Clark","I think Robert a fair amount of that depends on some of the acquisition opportunities that may present themselves throughout the year. So I really hesitate to give you a number on it but I guess what I would say is that again our capital deployment strategies are to ensure number one we don't go backwards relative to share count in terms of dilution. ","And again I anticipate having a slight benefit if anything from that line moving forward in 2014 but I guess again we look to make -- deploy capital, make the business stronger and then also look return cash to shareholders if that's the -- if can find good ways to do that. ","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Then I guess just my follow-up and I know you guys are not giving specific guidance by geography, but if I heard you correctly Bret it sounded like you were saying you expected the European market to expand around 100 basis points. Just given the growth for the company in 2013 was affected by some very company specific events like the sales force integration for example, is there any sense you can give us on just general range of where you could see dent supply grow in Europe in 2014 above that 100 basis points that you called out for the boarder market?","Bret W. Wise","Well we don't give guidance on internal growth either in total or by region. Europe obviously is a large region for us, over 45% of our sales are in that region. So any improvement in that region we get pretty good leverage on in our P&L and of course we haven't really had improvement in that region for the last three years. ","But I think the reason we called out what we expect the market can do with respect to both the European market and U.S. market next year was to send a signal that we're expecting those markets to accelerate a little bit and we would expect to get our fair share or perhaps a little more depending on the innovation pipeline when if in fact those markets do accelerate. ","So again we don't give specific guidance on internal growth by region but we were trying to signal that we would expect some improvement there. ","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs","Got it, thanks for the question. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. ","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Co. ","Good morning. Bret could you elaborate on what you saw on the fourth quarter between each of the sub segments, I am talking about like the implants, healthcare, lab, just like consumable, and then in the U.S. I believe last call you said you expected a draw down in the inventories, did that materialize and was that affect a net negative year-over-year versus the buy-ins last year which you saw in the fourth quarter? ","Bret W. Wise","","Okay. Let me take a step at the first question, I'll let Chris field the second question. Overall in Q4 we had internal growth of 0.8% but we had low single-digit growth in consumables in the specialties, we had kind of mid-single digit growth in the medical line and we had negative growth in the lab business. ","We don't give a lot of color within those categories although I'll give you a little bit of color on implant and in the future I would like to stick to the dealing with the specialties in total. But with respect to implants we were slightly negative on implant in the quarter with Germany. And without Germany we were slightly positive on implants in the quarter and that was led by the U.S. and the rest of world markets whereby of course Germany and Europe, Europe was negative for us in the quarter. ","So that's the -- that's kind of the general trends within each of those categories for the fourth quarter. ","Christopher T. Clark","So to go through the delivery inventories Brandon again we commented on the fourth quarter call last year that there were number of factors kind of going both ways. We saw the net impact of all of that was probably inflating internal growth in the quarter by up to a full percentage point. And the largest factor that we mentioned at the time was really the fact dealers kept heavy inventory levels in the U.S. in Q4 after our total price increase in some cases even increased them further in advance of a January first price increase last year. ","This year we ran up against that fourth quarter base issue and we also saw dealers as expected push their inventories down towards more towards normal level if you will after increasing them in advance of our October price increase this past year. So as expected we really saw pretty large divergence between retail sales and the wholesale sales in the quarter with the U.S. And again as we expected and you would be thinking of in general this growing channel inventories in aggregate are back down more towards normal levels if you will and that's probably got some give and takes across some of the individual businesses, but I think that's the aggregate comment holds.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Co. ","Thanks, and one more for Chris, could you give a sense of what your net interest expense expectation is for next year and then some view around operating cash flow and CapEx that will be helpful? Thank you.","Christopher T. Clark","","Yes, sure. Net interest expenses for the year we will have a little bit of benefit in terms of net interest expenses from the deleveraging but unfortunately it's going to be slightly offset as a result of lower interest income as we reduce some of the deleverage positions. So the net of that is just going to be essentially flat. ","In terms of cash flow for the year, obviously we had a pretty significant investment in working cap, in particular in inventory this year as we've mentioned. We would expect that to obviously not repeat as we move through particularly in the second half of next year and move forward. So I expect a little bit of a lift there. And again in terms of capital we entered last year guiding frankly in the $130 million range. We ended up at $100 million. That was really timing related on couple of key projects and I think for 2014 I would expect something back again guiding probably in $130 million range.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Co. ","Superb, thank you.","Christopher T. Clark","Okay.","Operator","","And we will go next to Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","Yes. Thanks and good morning. Hey Bret I just want to follow up on some of the comments you previously made around Europe, if we were to strip the implant business out of your Europe sales for a second, is it fair to say that, that in aggregate the business was in positive territory on an organic basis this quarter?","Bret W. Wise","Yes. It was and we had 16 running quarters of positive growth in Europe. This was first when we went negative, but absence implants and in particularly absent the German implants, yes, we would have been positive low single-digits.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","And so embedded in that, I guess you are suggesting that you continue to take some market share because, was the market you think flat or better or you think the market is still in a negative territory and you are just taking share because I am just trying to reconcile that back to your comment that you expect European market to expand 1% next year.","Bret W. Wise","Yeah. I think the market was flat plus or minus may be half a point. The data that we have on the European market is not as good, as we get in the U.S. market but just looking at all the data points in total we would say that, European market was flat in the fourth quarter and we were up low single-digits. That's entirely driven by the innovation platform we have and we would expect that to continue.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","And then may be just one sort of follow-up question on the guidance, it kind of sounds like you don't have any capital deployment sort of baked into that guidance and you are suggesting that you are going to take a balanced approach. Could you may be give us some sense for what the acquisition pipeline looks like at this point in time?","Bret W. Wise","","Yes. Let me ask -- let Chris take that.","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. I think from an acquisition standpoint there is lot of discussions happening. Again we were pleased to be able to complete two small deals in November. I commented as well that and again additional acquisition benefit that we will have in 2014 relates to the internalization of that minority interest line, which is certainly bringing -- that brings about $0.03 per share in terms of additional accretion. ","So again, I think that there is no doubt that we are continuing to look at acquisitions beyond what we have already done as opportunities, obviously, those are binary. They happen when they happen and we are optimistic we can done some sure but at this point in time I think our guidance reflects what we have already done.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","But just to confirm, you are comfortable with the leverage you're at right now so there is no plans to further deleverage it. As we think about use of free cash flow it should either be to do acquisitions or share repurchase.","Christopher T. Clark","","I think we have got some opportunity. Again I think, Glen the way to think about it would be a gradual, really a balanced approach. We may do some additional gradual deleveraging to provide additional dry powder for the future. But I think that's going to be in the context of a balanced approach relative to share repurchases and acquisition.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","Okay. Thank you.","Bret W. Wise","You bet.","Operator","And we will go next to John Kreger from William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company","","Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions on what you are assuming in guidance for '14. I know you don't like to give specific revenue targets but would it be reasonable to assume that on a consolidated basis you could do perhaps 3% or better for the year given your comments about some market growth improvement?","Bret W. Wise","","Yes. I don't want to give specific guidance on internal growth for the next year or for the current year 2014, but again in the guidance comments when we said that the market -- we are expecting markets to accelerate in the U.S. and Europe, we would expect to get our fair share of that.","And then secondly the wild card would be this rest of the world region where we've had these major devaluations. I am not sure what will happen in those countries but I think that adds some risk to the equation, certainly at this point. But to the extent we see the market acceleration happening we would expect to get our fair share or more of that. ","John Kreger - William Blair & Company","Great, thanks, Bret. And perhaps a follow-up, what's your pricing are you assuming you can get in 2014?","Bret W. Wise","Yeah, John our price increases were generally taken back in October. We are pleased in terms of basically at this point what looks like in terms of what is stuck. And again I would guide that in the range of probably 1.5% pretty consistent with where we have been in the past. ","John Kreger - William Blair & Company","Great, thanks. And then one last one, Bret if you look at the implant market more broadly what are you seeing in terms of the three different sort of broad price points and are you sort of comfortable with your offering across those three price points?","Bret W. Wise ","","Let me take a stab at that. I don't know if Jim will have anything to add or not. Obviously the three price points for implant is there is a premium segment out there which includes a vast array of technologies, everything from digital treatment implanting to drill guides to customized assortments, implants et cetera, it's pretty broad category. There is kind of a mid-tier sector and there is kind of low tier sector. ","We don't -- we participate in the premium sector only at present. I think that particularly in Europe where the economy has been really, really horrible premium implants have had a lot of pressure and in that environment I think as in every area of dentistry lower cost products sometimes gain some share. I think over the long-term in this, in what's a pretty technical discipline within dentistry we are going to see people want to use the most advanced technologies and that's where our focus has been. Jim you want to comment on that. ","James G. Mosch ","Sure. Yeah, John, from a standpoint of the implant business globally, we continue to focus on the premium category. We believe that there continues to be a lot of opportunities for differentiation. We have plans for innovation in that area. Some of the things I mentioned earlier as it relates to digital technologies and I think the impact that they can have to offer a lot of value and more simplicity for the clinician we will continue to focus on. ","As it relates to the value segment we continue to monitor and analyze that closely. There is no question we can see the visibility of that segment in the emerging markets. In the more developed and more premium markets we continue to watch that closely as well. And I think the challenge that we see is that while there is certainly a lot of dialogue in that segment the difference between the premium and the value implant of $50 to $75 how that would influence the cost of treatment at the patient level of $2,500 to $3,000 is just a little bit uncertain at this point in time. And we continue to monitor that to understand really what's going to be the driver in the market. ","John Kreger - William Blair & Company","Very helpful, thanks. ","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we will take our next question from Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank","Hi. Thanks, good morning. Just a quick question on operating margin and leverage, you talked about some opportunities on the manufacturing side for operating leverage in 2014. That seems to be incorporated in to the guidance. I guess the question is, is the operating margin expansion specifically tied to your expectations of accelerated market growth in key geographies in 2014 or do you think you can achieve the operating margin expansion from your various initiatives even if the market improvement does not materialize? Thanks. ","Bret W. Wise ","Yes, Steve, it's Bret. I mean bottom line is there is no doubt that a more robust market certainly helps us in terms of operating margin leverage to our P&L. So our guidance includes obviously an estimated operating margin based on what we are estimating market growth to be and basically our sales performance to-date. So there is no doubt that obviously helps a bit. ","That said we are also cognizant as I mentioned before that in lower growth environments we need to focus on manufacturing and the operating margin via efforts of our own and as I commented I think previously in terms of what that entails. And we are very focused on that and committed to that. And we have taken a number of actions last year that will obviously help us as we move forward this year, and we have got additional focus on that as we move through 2014. ","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. So I guess it's tied into that. So like in the last quarter you just had about 10 bips of operating margin expansion that was lower than what we saw in the middle of 2013 and obviously the growth organically slowed down a little bit in the top line in the fourth quarter. It sounds there's additional things you can do though in \u201914, so it sounds like that the run rate exiting \u201913 is the proper assumption for what you are capable of, is that the way to think of it?","Bret W. Wise","Yes obviously I think there is no doubt that the fourth quarter additional sales growth would help but I mean there\u2019s couple of other significant factors on our operating margin, one is, I mean currency is a very significant factor. I mean we talk about currency in terms of a headwind of about $0.03 in the quarter in terms of basically operating profit, on slightly positive translational impact on the top line, if you can kind of see how that can have enormous impact. ","So again I think there's some aberrations there in the fourth quarter but again as we move forward we have a lot of efforts in place to continue to improve in this area and if we get any width in the market that helps us further. ","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, got it. Thanks. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question today from Jon Block from Stifel.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","","Great, thanks, good morning. I've got maybe one or two just sort of clarifications and then one or two follow-ups. So first sort of clarification question, Chris, the tax rate step up that you mentioned in 2014, is that permanent, should we think of that as permanent or something specific to 2014 and then the FX headwind for $0.03 that you called out on the quarter, where was that relative to where you were in late October? I think it might only have been a penny additional relative to where you were in late October, is that correct?","Christopher T. Clark","","Yes, so let me handle that one first. Yes, the FX was penny, incremental penny worse than what we had guided on the -- or indicated or suggested on the third quarter call, in the fourth quarter and the bulk of that change again was in what I'll call the second tier currencies which in aggregate for us comprise about 25% of our sales and as you look at it through 2013 there had been almost little over 10% devaluation in that basket of currencies versus the major currencies U.S. dollar, euro and Swiss. So that\u2019s a big impact for us obviously in the quarter and obviously causing the bulk of the headwind for \u201914. ","Relative to the operating tax rate really what\u2019s driving that is mix, obviously the international tax systems is pretty complicated, overall forecasting estimate but I think the primary variable for us is the geographic mix of income and in short we had a mixed benefit or tailwind in 2013 if you look at and compare that rate to 2012 rate you see that it really was an improvement in \u201913 versus \u201912 but we don\u2019t, at this point expect that to repeat or fully repeat in 2014. So again it\u2019s really more driven based on our mixed estimate in terms of income. ","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay, great.","Bret W. Wise","I will add to that, just longer term whether we can then get the rate back down again in future periods I think is yet to be seen, there\u2019s lot of tax planning that we do and you have seen that rate move around a little bit from year-to-year. I don't know that this is a permanent change as much as it is a mixed change for 2014. ","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay, perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just sort of clarification question, Bret you mentioned the rest of the world, obviously you are getting a headwind from the currency devaluating relative to USD and I guess the euro as well. Just for preparing purposes, should we think about it, I think you mentioned flat growth is that in the rest of the world or is that in the emerging component of rest of the world as we think about growth in \u201914?","Bret W. Wise","","Well I am going to start and I think Chris will finish it but when you look at our rest of the world category it includes basically three developed markets and then the rest are emerging markets. The three developed markets are Canada, Australia and Japan, all three of which took a major currency devaluation in 2013, late 2013. So even the developed countries in that category got hit hard by currency. And when you look at the developed team components of rest of world of course and Chris can give you more statistics on this essentially all those countries took a pretty major development, excuse me, devaluation in the fourth quarter so it\u2019s both components.","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay.","Christopher T. Clark","","I think the comment we made Jon was that the developed countries in those rest of the world region sales were essentially flat for the year and emerging markets overall for us were up mid-single to high single digits for the year. ","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","All right, and maybe last one, and I will take the rest offline but just specific to the German implant business can you guys take a step back and discuss how comfortable you are, maybe some of the weakness and I think the weakness may have been [maintenance] stretching up longer than originally anticipated. Is that specific to the sales force reorg instead of sort of the market fundamentals and where you hear of you guys getting more aggressive, so can you maybe tease that out for us in Germany? What is sort of sales force reorg voice that will be in the rear view mirror shortly versus underlying market fundamentals?","James G. Mosch","Yes, Jon this is Jim Mosch. I mean from the data that we see from our competitors and also industry data, there is an indication that the implant market in Germany is down overall. So that\u2019s not been helpful in the year. With respect to our integration activities we are very comfortable that, that organization has stabilized. It probably took us a couple of quarters longer than we would have liked but these were two large organizations and I think when you merge two organizations and one is the larger than the other, one essentially absorbs the other. When they are the same you got to combine them and therein lies the complexity of our German integration. ","But we have seen sequential improvement in Germany and we are seeing a nice uptick so far in Q1, albeit this is compared to a post integration quarter in 2013 but we are comfortable that, that organization has stabilized and that we will move forward favorably. ","Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Great, thanks for your time guys.","James G. Mosch","Thanks, Jon. ","Operator","","And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Leckow I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional comments or remarks. ","Derek Leckow","","Okay, thank you very much for your interest in DENTSPLY.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Derek Leckow","Thank you, Erin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s second quarter 2015 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

Bret?","Bret Wise","Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thank you again for joining us here on our second quarter call. Overall we were very pleased with how things developed in the second quarter. Certainly we believe the markets are showing some signs of improvement, while our own results accelerated nicely both on the topline and on the bottom-line. Before we get into specifics about our performance, I\u2019d like to provide some brief comments about the regional markets. From our perspective, the US remains quite healthy, stable and growing and given the job growth numbers, we expect that to continue. In Europe, we also saw a notable improvement in demand sequentially. This was most notable in the southern countries, but also in the UK and the Nordics. Russia on the other hand continues to be a difficult market. In the rest of world, I\u2019d say there was more good news than bad. We saw the markets demonstrating good stable growth in the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, as well as in Japan and Australia. ","At DENTSPLY, as you know, we\u2019ve been focused on how to become more efficient internally, while channeling funds back into initiatives that can drive sustainable growth above the market irrespective of the market conditions. And in that regard we made some important strategic and operational changes that Jim will update you on in his remarks. Thus far, the program is going very well, but our reinvestments have been limited and part to the extent we\u2019ve had reinvestments, those have been focused on actually funding the efficiency initiatives. But in certain cases where we\u2019ve channeled some seed money for growth back into the business, we\u2019re getting good results, nice results and we are now entering a period where we expect to be able to generate additional savings that will allow us to begin to accelerate these investments and growth on a go- forward basis. ","Moving to our specific results for the quarter, overall internal growth came in at a positive 3.6%. That was led by the rest of world, which was up 7.9%, followed by the US, which was up 3.3% and Europe was a positive 1.9%. The rest of world numbers are quite good and reflect solid internal growth across most of the regions that are included in this total for us. Japan recovered nicely in this quarter as expected given the low base from last year\u2019s Q2 and as you recall, that followed a VAT tax increase April 1, 2014. So there was a movement in 2014 of sales into the first quarter and now the second quarter. So the baseline for this year was rather low. However, even though Japan was strong by comparison, it was up mid-single digits, it was still slightly dilutive to the rest of world number we have here. So the 7.9% number we have for the rest of world is not really bolstered by the Japan number. ","In US, we saw a solid demand across most of our businesses, which with the exception of lab that was down slightly. Recall that we are discontinuing some products in the lab business, which is muting the reported growth for now. In Europe, we were up 1.9% and that\u2019s despite a continued drag from the CIS region. Ex-CIS we were up 3.1%. This reflects really nice growth in consumables and the specialty categories, while lab again was negative for the same reason it was in the US. It\u2019s reflecting those discontinued products. From an execution perspective, we are pleased with the organic growth in the topline as noted and despite the significant drag from currency; we\u2019ve done pretty well bringing the earnings through the income statement. ","On an adjusted basis, we delivered 180 basis points of operating margins expansion to get to 21.1% for the quarter. That\u2019s our best performance in five plus years. EPS was up, our adjusted EPS was up 6% in the quarter and that\u2019s despite a significant drag from currency. So overall we feel good about the results and also good about the outlook. One other thing I want to comment on was the restructuring charge we took this quarter. As you know we announced this was coming back in May when we resolved the negotiations with the Works Council in Germany and we\u2019ll now begin to implement this program in the third quarter. To date, there has been a drag on our performance from this program due to the discontinued products, which I\u2019ve mentioned here, but also because of the uncertainty of what the outcome would look like. ","Moving into the back half of the year, we should begin to see the benefits, including more efficiency, but also more focus, more clarity on which products are important to the future of this business. Also, given our performance to date and the benefits we now see in the back half, we are in good position to begin to accelerate our growth investments while also reaching our margin and earnings goals. We are keeping a close eye on risk from this program of course, because there is the potential for disruption, but we are pleased to date that that disruption has been minimal and we\u2019ve been able to manage through it. We expect to see more benefits from putting our shoulder more firmly behind the growth projects in the program and we believe that can begin to be impactful as we move into next year. ","So based on our earnings to date, the markets developments as we see them and the outlook for the net benefits coming from the efficiency program, we\u2019re adjusting our guidance range from the 250 to 260 that we established at the beginning of the year to a new range of adjusted earnings per share for the year of 254 to 262. This reflects our confidence in our performance so far in the initiatives we have under way and also the currency drag that we expect based on the rates today and of course also the other points I\u2019ve noted this morning. ","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Jim Mosch. Jim?","Jim Mosch","Thank you, Bret. I\u2019d like to provide an operational update for Q2 and also provide some further perspective on 2015 initiatives. I\u2019ll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review. As Bret noted, we saw good performance across all regions in Q2. Providing some perspective to this, our global consumables business delivered solid mid-single digit internal growth in the quarter. New products launched in the latter part of 2014 and Q1 of 2015 in both the restorative and preventive areas are driving growth, coupled with procedural selling efforts in the areas of class two and post endodontic restorations. In addition, US retail growth appears to be stable and growing well versus prior year. ","Our dental specialties business also performed well with mid-single digit internal growth, led by our endodontic and implant businesses. Endodontic businesses have benefited from recently launched products such as WaveOne GOLD, ProTaper Next NiTi Files and new irrigation and root canal filling products. The implant business continues to get strong traction from our new implant system ASTRA TECH EV, SYMBIOS Biphasic Bone Graft Material and additional implant platforms in our ATLANTIS customized abutment business. The prosthetics business was down mid-single digits on a global basis. This was driven by challenging market conditions in traditional lab products and discontinued products as a result of the restructuring of our European lab business. ","From a geographic perspective, we saw upper mid-single digit growth in rest of world, driven by Asia and Latin America. These regions certainly benefit from new products across all businesses, but in addition we have worked to stabilize these businesses, ensure dealer compliance and invested to strengthen the management teams, as well as expand the selling organizations. From a new product perspective, we highlighted the products we launched at IDS, WaveOne GOLD, endodontic files, the VDW Connect and X-Smart iQ, which is an iPad based endomotor and the Cercon ht Shaded Zirconia milling disk. We saw impact from these products in Q2. However, some of these products such as the new endomotors will begin the formal launch and shipments in Q3 and we expect improved momentum throughout the year. In addition we have a strong new product pipeline and we\u2019ll have new product launches across most of our businesses in the latter part of Q3 and Q4. ","In the Q1 analyst call, we introduced the formation of three segments. The formation of these segments and more specifically the creation of global businesses, global product platforms and single country operating units, are part of our global efficiency and investment initiative. Our stated objective is to achieve a 20% adjusted operating margin for the full year of 2017 while providing estimates to support the growth of the business for the long term. In Q2, we crossed the 20% threshold at 21.1%. Please note that Q2 tends to be our seasonally largest and most profitable quarter. However, we are beginning to see the results from elements of our global efficiency initiative, including the procurement program which Chris will address. In addition we are proceeding with restructurings of our European lab business as well as other restructurings related to country and global business formation process. This process will accelerate as we close 2015 and throughout 2016. ","We are confident that these are realizable expense improvements and as we effectively align the businesses and create operational efficiency. As indicated, an important element of this initiative is investment. To date, most of our spending has been utilized to create efficiencies. We now shift our focus to investments for long-term growth. We are planning increasing levels in investment over the coming quarters in areas of in-field marketing resources, salesforce expansion and expansion of clinical education through further investments in field based programs. This investment will support two or three growth drivers, sales excellence and clinical education. The third area, innovation, will see further investment in the future as the global businesses complete formation and alignment. Our objective will be to invest in larger R&D projects and platform technologies which have greater risk, but also significant value. ","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris for the financial results. ","Chris Clark ","Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our second quarter results by reviewing key elements of our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement and also by providing some additional color on capital deployment and highlight a few key related initiatives. ","For the second quarter, sales excluding precious metals, declined 7.7% compared to prior year as internal growth of 3.6% was more than fully offset by negative currency translation of 10.9%.","Net acquisition growth was negative 0.4% in the quarter, as the impact of several small divestitures of non-core product lines offset modest acquisition growth. ","We had strong operating margin performance in the quarter as our second quarter operating margin rate of 21.1% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, improved by 180 basis points over 19.3% in the prior year quarter. ","This was our strongest quarterly operating margin performance in 28 quarters. This represents the impact of significant internal focus on this measure via our global efficiency improvement initiative, as well as positive benefits from price, mix and currency, partially offset by incremental spending to support our efficiency initiative, as well as lower absorption in the period as we brought down inventory by three days in the quarter, compared with three-day-billed in the second quarter last year.","Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the second quarter was 60.2% of sales, excluding precious metals and this was an improvement of 170 basis points over prior year. ","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.1% of sales, excluding precious metals, net down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. The benefits of our global efficiency program are currently skewing more heavily to the gross profit line, rather than the SG&A line at present as is the currency impact. ","The global efficiency program is increasingly impacting our P&L on a number of areas. I commented last quarter on the increasing momentum of our global procurement initiative and we continue to be pleased with the traction of this effort. In addition, we\u2019re realizing the expected impacts of our earlier restructuring efforts and anticipate accelerating benefits from our more recent restructuring initiatives. ","In the quarter, we recorded $38.9 million of restructuring and other costs. That\u2019s largely associated with our global efficiency program. The largest impact was from the restructuring of our European laboratory business that we announced in late May. In addition to improving the profitability of this business, this initiative allows us to realign resources on strategic growth opportunities as opposed to less profitable and lower growth non-strategic product lines. As part of the initiative, we are discontinuing some of these low margin non-core products, and in the second quarter, discontinued products deflated internal growth on a global basis by approximately 35 basis points. ","With respect to our return expectations on restructuring initiatives up this tight, we typically look for ROIs between 20% and 40% on these initiatives. And we expect the savings associated with the European laboratory restructuring initiative to begin to materialize in the back half of the year, with the savings mostly saved in by calendar 2017 with a small incremental amount carrying over into 2018. ","Our reported tax rate for the second quarter was 32.2%, reflecting the temporary headwind associated with some of the restructuring efforts. Our operating tax rate for the quarter was 22.8%, up 40 basis points above our second quarter rate last year. And as projected, we are seeing a slight continued headwind in tax rate as a result of projected unfavorable geographic earnings mix in 2015 compared to last year. ","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the second quarter was $44.1 million or $0.31 per diluted share. That compared to $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the release, the most significant of which is the restructuring cost that I described earlier. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $103.3 million in the quarter, compared to $99.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EPS improved by 6% to $0.73 from last year\u2019s second quarter, and currency represented a headwind earnings in the quarter of approximately 5%. ","Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $145.8 million. That\u2019s down $9.9 million from last year\u2019s record second quarter of $155.7 million, but it represents a 50% increase over the second quarter of 2013. We continue to be very pleased with our cash flow performance, as our trailing 12-month operating cash flow was up 9% versus the previous 12-month period ending June 2014, while our free cash flow yield remains very strong at 6.5%. Moreover, our free cash flow conversion continues to be excellent as our second quarter free cash flow of $129 million represents 125% of our adjusted net income for the period. ","Inventories finished on 115 days in June. That\u2019s down three days sequentially and down eight days from prior year. We traditionally see inventories creep up in the second quarter, so the sequential improvement this quarter is reflective of our ongoing focus on driving working capital improvements. ","Accounts receivable were at 58 days in June. That\u2019s flat to prior quarter and on a sequential basis and down one day from last year. ","Capital expenditures were $17 million in the quarter, while depreciation was $19 million and amortization was$11 million. ","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 200,000 shares at an average cost of $51.68 per share. For the first quarter 2015, we\u2019ve now repurchased one -- first half of 2015, we have repurchased 1.9 million shares and our leverage ratio defined as net debt divided by trailing 12 months EBITDA stood at 1.9 times at the end of June. Looking forward, our balance sheet and cash flow generation continue to provide us considerable flexibility to create shareholder value through acquisitions and share buybacks.","Looking forward, we anticipate the currency headwind to earnings to be a bit more than the $0.07 impact headwind that we experienced in the first half of the year. That\u2019s net of the impact of our cash flow hedges. As you may recall, these hedges helped to partially blend our FX rate over a rolling 18-month period. And while they do not eliminate or reduce the long-term impact of currency changes, they do reduce the volatility by essentially gradualizing these rate changes.","Finally, as Bret indicated, based on our strong first half performance, we are raising our 2015 earnings guidance \u2013 earnings per share guidance to $2.54 to $2.62 on an adjusted basis. This reflects the strength in momentum in internal growth and our global efficiency program, as well as the additional slight headwind in currency that I just described. I would note that we have a tougher comparison in the third quarter as that was our strongest quarterly performance last year while that comparison eases in Q4. ","That completes our prepared remarks and we certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019d now be glad to take any questions that you might have. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Nathan Rich","Thanks. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. First on the lab restructuring, it sounds like you guys can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I think you said it was a 35 basis points drag on internal growth in 2Q. Bret, could you maybe just update on what you have left now that you\u2019ve received the approval to move forward in Germany? And as we think about the back half of the year, should we think about internal growth being maybe higher by a similar amount to that 35 basis points as we think about our models?","Bret Wise","Okay, I\u2019m going to take a stab at that and then Chris may have something to add there. Just for reference purposes, we announced back in September last year that we were entering into the negotiations with the works council to restructure the European lab business. Those negotiations took us out till May, so about eight months, eight or nine months we were in a period where the market knew we were going to do something there, our employees knew we were going to do something, but it wasn\u2019t resolved what exactly it would be. So the announcement may allowed us to then move forward and implement the program. ","In the interim time, there has been a slight drag on growth of this business because the market could see what the options were and start to move away from those product lines that we are likely to discontinue and of course there was confusion or disruption in the employee group because of that also. So this quarter, of course we announced in May and the impact is now known which products exactly will be discontinued, et cetera and the employee base as being [indiscernible] on the products that will go forward. I expect that drag, although I have a hard time quantifying it, I expect that drag from the discontinued products now will actually increase a little bit for a couple of quarters and we\u2019ll probably normalize that sometime after the first quarter next year or so. I don\u2019t know, Chris.","Chris Clark ","I concur with that. I think Nathan, the underlying, I would assume that the underlying performance, operational performance of the business would actually improve given the certainty in terms of how we\u2019re moving forward. Obviously, knowing that there\u2019s restructuring that\u2019s being negotiated, that\u2019s uncertain for the employees and obviously the ability to focus on a moving forward basis on really the new business, I think is very much a positive moving forward. The product lines being discounted however there\u2019s now certainty on those and certainly certainty in the marketplace and certainty with customers. I would expect that headwind to continue for the next few quarters and probably a threat, I mentioned increase a bit in terms of the product line discontinuation, offset by really what I would expect to be some improvement in the operating performance, the underlying business as a result of the restructuring, known being known and moving forward.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs","Thanks helpful and if I could ask one quick follow up. One of the areas of re-investment that you talked about was expanding the sales force. Could you give us any metrics on how big of a piece that is, how many reps will be added, what percent of the total that is? Can you remind us, in the past when you have invested in the sales force, what does the ramp up period look like before the new reps get up to full productivity?","Bret Wise","Go ahead, Jim.","Jim Mosch","Yeah, Nathan. We\u2019ve taken a review of our global sales organization. Certainly look at some of the areas that we are seeing some good performance and recognize that further investment would give us some upside. More specifically, we\u2019re looking really at the US market and selectively at some of our emerging markets. We\u2019ll make some decision just based on deployment and current levels at to how much that will be. We\u2019re finalizing that at this point in time. From a standpoint of payback for me, it depends on obviously a lot of factors. Market to market segment and obviously quite frankly in some of the emerging markets, the actual cost of a rep, which tends to be lower. But we see a ramp up period of probably 12 to 18 months. We like that to be obviously closer to 12, but that\u2019s a good metric that we look at overall.","Derek Leckow","Jim, this is Derrek, Nathan. That\u2019s talking about the earnings implications of the move, right Jim?","Jim Mosch","That\u2019s correct. ","Derek Leckow","Sales implications happen much earlier than that.","Jim Mosch","Sales implication happen immediately, but from a standpoint of us being able to fund the expansion, we typically see that to fully fund that expense or recover that expense, it\u2019s usually a year to year and a half ramp up.","Nathan Rich","Have you made a decision on how many reps you\u2019re going to be adding?","Jim Mosch","Not specifically, no.","Nathan Rich","Okay, thank you.","Bret Wise","That\u2019s an on-going program. So as we generate savings, we\u2019ll be deciding. Some of the savings of course are going to drop through in the form of margin expansion, but as we generate savings, that will become part of our normal budget process and in some time, in some instances, it will be mid-year adjustments, off cycles additions. It's hard to telegraph exactly what the number would be at this point.","Nathan Rich","Makes sense. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","We will take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So first question is I wonder if you could spend a minute reflecting on the 2017 margin objectives. It's always nice to hear how the thinking there is evolving and I'd say particularly here, given how strong the margins were in the quarter. Of course we appreciative that you want to continue investing in the business, but then it sort of begs the question, okay, if we have now more flexibility to invest in the business, considering how well we are doing in terms of the efficiency initiatives, then maybe that positions you to think talk a little bit more of how you think about organic growth evolving over the next couple of years. How do you think about the interplay between those dynamics given the progress that you\u2019re seeing here?","Bret Wise","This is Bret. I'll take a stab at that. Certainly, we are ahead of where we thought we would be in the margin expansion program. It's beginning to gain traction now, strong traction and that creates flexibility for us, because you might remember, this is not, and you alluded to it in your question, this not just a cost cutting exercises. This is an exercise of taking fixed costs and turning them into variable costs so that we can accelerate investments where we see growth opportunities. That\u2019s probably the most important part of the program frankly, but we are ahead of where our internal targets were on the margin expansion program. That\u2019s going to allow us to bring some of the investments forward and we should generate growth sooner in the program as well.","I will say, with respect to the 20% operating margin target in 2017, we are ahead of where we thought we would be now. I think you should view that 20% opening margin target as an interim target. We\u2019ll re-assess that target with respect to where we are in the program when we get to that program. Now, we are at 99 for the first six months of this year. We\u2019re doing pretty well which is what's giving us the flexibility to invest in the growth initiatives and move forward. I don\u2019t want to get too far out in front of ourselves here on trying to describe the impact on internal growth, but of course we wouldn\u2019t be making those investments if we didn\u2019t think it would accelerate internal growth going forward. Chris or Jim, you want to add anything?","Chris Clark ","No, I think that\u2019s accurate and obviously we are headed where we thought we\u2019d be. We are getting some help from FX on that line, but we\u2019re also getting some good help in terms of the efficiency program. That\u2019s regaining traction and based on the moves initiatives in play, it look like it\u2019s going to accelerate, which is in line with our expectations.","Jim Mosch","I would also say there\u2019s transitionally effects too. Obviously as we got through this and we create new territories, we create new positions. We transition businesses. There\u2019s a time phase until those thing become totally efficient. ","Steve Beuchaw","Just one follow up to a comment that was made in the prepared remarks for you, Chris. Thanks for calling out the cash flow in the business and how that relates to what's going on in net income. We\u2019ve been wondering about the balance sheet, the extent to which you might, with working capital efficiency, be able to drive faster, free cash flow growth over time. Have you guys thought much about how much or how sustainable that is, the ability to drive free cash flow growth ahead of net income given what you\u2019ve seen on the balance sheet today? Are there any parameter around that that you could share with us? ","Chris Clark ","We certainly believe that there\u2019s some suitable improvements possible here for the next several periods. Obviously, it's going to vary quarter to quarter. I don\u2019t want to set the expectation on a quarterly basis, but I think over the next couple of years, you should expect us to continue to make improvements in terms of working capital. We are still in over 115 days of inventory. That\u2019s not exactly world class. That\u2019s better than where we\u2019ve been, but we\u2019ve got some significant opportunities and a number of initiatives in play to drive that down, both in terms of how we operate, but also how we are structured. ","Again, I think that you should expect to see that gradual improvement, again not necessary quarter to quarter but over time. Again, the fact that historically I think if you went and looked back, last year we improved, we increased inventories in the second quarter by three days. You go back to 2013, I believe they went up by six days in the quarter. To get inventories down by three days in the second quarter, which is typically one of our largest build periods I think is indicative of the traction that we\u2019re getting.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Thanks again guys. Have a good morning.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard","Good morning. Bret, with respect to Europe, if we look back over the last two years, we\u2019ve seen a real I guess saw tooth pattern in the trends there. Realize there\u2019s been several moving parts between CIS and discontinued products, but do you feel comfortable enough at this stage to say we\u2019re perhaps back on more sustainable consistent growth trajectory in that region?","Bret Wise","I think that\u2019s an interesting question because the saw tooth pattern, Brandon occurred because of different countries moving in different directions all at the same time, whereas today the pattern is, it's much more consistent, meaning many more countries are moving in the right direction than before there was a balance, more moving down and more moving up, et cetera. Now there seems to be more momentum in more countries. We saw in the results today, we still have countries where there were slight declines in sales growth, but there were many, many more that had slight increases in sales growth and thus it appears to be a more sustainable pattern to us. Now, time will tell. We\u2019ve been surprised before, but I think the region in total seems to be more stable today, seems to be -- they\u2019re still dealing with some issues in Greece and et cetera, but that doesn\u2019t seem to create any contagion to the other countries at this point. It's hard for me to make that call at that point, other than to say what we see right now would tell us that it looks to be more sustainable. ","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful, and then maybe one for Jim. I didn\u2019t hear you mention the ortho business. Has there been any change in the ASP environment there and any update you could give us on where you are with MTM in terms of the rollout and the traction you\u2019re seeing there would be helpful. Thanks","Jim Mosch","Certainly. Yeah, from the standpoint of the ortho business, I would say that the pattern is pretty similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past few quarters. The market is still very competitive. I would say that we are seeing some improvement in our North American business. Europe and rest of world still remains very, very competitive. From the standpoint of our MTM business, obviously that is, it is a smaller business, but we are seeing some excellent growth. We are pleased at the case uptake that we see in that business. A lot of it is going to be our continued investment in the clinical education program and our sales efforts to ensure we get continued adoption and increased case volume. But we are pleased with the performance of the MTM business.","Brandon Rouillard - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from John Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Ethan Roth","Thanks. This is actually Ethan Roth on for John Block. Maybe first just on the margin expansion, it\u2019s been critical of a story and you\u2019ve exceeded the 2007 goal of 20% in the quarter, which is allowing you to reinvest a portion of the savings fund growth initiatives. I know that you mentioned that you are ahead of plan, but looking beyond 2017, what do you consider to be the peak operating margin for the overall business?","Bret Wise","Well, clearly this business can and has produced operating margins above 20% and that\u2019s why we continue to describe the 20% target as an interim target and a net target, meaning it\u2019s net of the reinvestment and it\u2019s an interim target which we would expect to meet on the timeframes we\u2019ve established. But as we get closer to that timeframe, we\u2019ll be able to update that target and the guidance based on the maturity of our efficiency program and what we see the reinvestments generating in returns. So I don\u2019t want to put a stake in the ground on what the maximum operating margins are for this business, but it\u2019s above that 20% target that we have today.","Ethan Roth","Okay, great. And then and I know you mentioned that momentum has picked up in the business and the 2Q internal stack growth stepped up a bit sequentially, but your comps get more difficult in the back half of the year. Do you think it\u2019s realistic to think that you can maintain this 3% plus internal growth, just given the momentum of the business?","Bret Wise","We don\u2019t publish an internal growth target for the year. Although the reason I went through what we see in the regional markets was to give you some indication of what we see the underlying conditions to be. So at this point, we see stable to improving results in both the US and Europe and that\u2019s, it\u2019s 80% of our sales base, so that\u2019s a big factor. And then the wild card has always been the rest of world countries and there\u2019s 120 countries in that category. So it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to make a firm call on that. But based on the underlying trends that we see in the markets today, we feel pretty good about growth prospects for the back half of the year. And I don\u2019t think I would --We are not too concerned about what the baseline is in making those kind of calls at this point.","Ethan Roth","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we can take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is open.","Matt Pfau","Hey guys, this is Matt. I have a question specifically related to the US market. You\u2019ve seen a little bit of acceleration there. Is that coming from patient traffic spend per visit, or some of the other specialty products? Thanks.","Bret Wise","Okay Matt. That\u2019s difficult for us to know what those underlying trends are at the dentists\u2019 office themselves. I mean we buy surveys and so forth and some of those show that patient traffic is improving. But from our perspective, the general consumables, the products we sell through distributors are really the strongest category we have right now and those products really don\u2019t move other than through patient traffic. So that tells us -- I mean if we had to guess, we would say there has been an acceleration of patient visits and these patients are getting back into their office. And generally when that happens, then you see the specialty business pick up on a little bit of a trailing basis. So if we had to guess patient traffic trends have improved from where they were for instance a year ago and with the job growth coming, we would think that that would continue. I don\u2019t \u2013Do you guys have anything to add on that.","Jim Mosch","I think that\u2019s right.","Chris Clark","That is correct.","Matt Pfau","And if I could ask a follow up relative to margin in the quarter. You said price, mix and currency were some of the reasons as to why you got some expansion. Have you guys broken that out as to the contribution?","Chris Clark","Yeah. If you look at the 180 basis points in the quarter, a bit over half is currency. Again recognizing that with the cash flow hedges, the impact on our bottom line is less than the translation impact to the headwind on the top line. About a third of it, a little over a third on a gross basis is the efficiency program and pricing mix are helpful, but then we had headwinds from reinvestments and then also headwinds from absorption as I mentioned earlier where again last year we built inventories by three days and this year we brought it down.","Matt Pfau","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We can take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning guys. Congratulations on a very good quarter here. Just want to ask on organic growth, I want to make sure I understand. Bret, are you saying that you\u2019re going to absorb some of those inefficiencies as you\u2019ve shut down some of these lab stuff and that\u2019s just going to get absorbed into organic growth? You\u2019re not going to drop that out to any kind of discontinued operations or anything where you\u2019d ax that out of your organic growth rate?","Bret Wise","Jeff, we didn\u2019t intend to do that. As those products come out, it does create a slight drag on internal growth. Our plan was to report internal growth to you each quarter and then let you know what the drag was, but we were not going to attempt to normalize it for a product dropping out here or there and we\u2019ve quantified the range of that drag going forward here. Of course that\u2019s a temporary drag because once we anniversary those discontinuances, then that\u2019s going to drop out. ","Chris Clark","There are also new products being launched in that business as well. ","Bret Wise","Yeah, correct. ","Jeff Johnson","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I just wanted to make sure so I\u2019ve got my model set up. And then in the US, the 3.9% organic growth, this is going to sound like a very picky comment in the context of a very good quarter, so it\u2019s not meant to be, but a little bit slower than last quarter\u2019s 4.5%. End markets seem to be getting better. Is that just normal fluctuation? Anything to think about there in the US number?","Bret Wise","Jeff, that\u2019s a very picky question. ","Jeff Johnson","I know it is. ","Bret Wise","I think it fluctuates around -- a lot of things can affect that. Dealer inventory is going to affect that and so forth by 50 basis points here. Yeah, 50 basis points to 100 basis points. We\u2019re not troubled by the -- we\u2019re slightly stronger in the first quarter. It\u2019s a little bit, just a little bit weaker here, but overall this year we\u2019re up around 4% organically in the US, probably a little bit above the market. If we had to guess in the market, we\u2019d say somewhere 3 and 3.5 is what the market is growing. We\u2019ll know a lot more than that as we\u2019ve seen more distributors report, et cetera. But we feel pretty about the number. We feel good about the momentum. The execution is good and the seed investments we\u2019ve put in are bearing results here. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re overly troubled by the US number. ","Jeff Johnson","Understood and then last question for me just, Jim, anything you can give us by geography on maybe the dental implant numbers? We\u2019re still seeing some nice pick up in North America and maybe you already talked about this. I\u2019ve been jumping between calls, but just any geographic details on the dental implant. Then maybe I didn\u2019t hear you here say anything about the medical business this quarter. ","Bret Wise","I\u2019ll take implants. You want \u2013","Jim Mosch","Medical, yeah.","Bret Wise","You can comment on medical. Implant unit growth was pretty nice for us in the US in the second quarter. If I had to characterize it regionally, I\u2019d say the rest of the world was our strongest region and that followed by Europe and the US. The trends seem to be favorable there. It varies by technology at this point, but we think we are picking up momentum on implant unit placements and that\u2019s being driven by the new product that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year or so on these calls, ASTRA TECH EV. Did you want to comment?","Jim Mosch","Yeah. Jeff, as it relates to the medical business, we are seeing really good mid-single digit growth in that business. We\u2019re pleased with the performance. We\u2019re seeing some nice growth in our US market and in addition we have some fairly significant new products coming in in the coming quarters. So we look for continued improvement in that business. ","Jeff Johnson","And Bret, with EV being the main driver and pricing on that product has to be pretty good at this point, you refer to unit growth and I can understand why you might for Asia PAC, but I would assume in US and even in Europe, unit growth doesn\u2019t differ a whole lot from dollar growth?","Bret Wise","Yeah, the unit growth does differ a little bit, meaning the point that you raise is important and that is that the price is higher on EV than some of the legacy products. So as the mix shifts to EV, the effect on revenue is a little bit higher than the effect on unit growth. So I\u2019m using unit growth here to give you a perspective on what\u2019s happening to the number of our own dental implant screws that are getting placed, irrespective of which brand it is.","Jeff Johnson","All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. At this time, there are no additional questions. I\u2019d turn to turn the program back over to our presenters.","End of Q&A","Derek Leckow","Thank you all very much, everyone. That concludes our conference call today.

Today's conference is being recorded.","And, at this time, I'd like to turn things over to Joshua Zable, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on our presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and our financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And, with that, I'll now turn the program over to Mark Thierer, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Josh. Good morning and thank you all for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. Our results for the third quarter were strong. Our reported revenue was up 5.8% to just over $1 billion and our adjusted EPS was $0.70 compared to $0.66 last year. We feel good about these results and we feel good about our outlook for the balance of the year.","I'm very pleased to be part of this great organization. And I thought I'd begin by sharing my thought process behind joining Dentsply Sirona. As some of you know, I just finished up my tour, integrating my former company, Catamaran, into the OptumRx platform. We sold Catamaran to UnitedHealthcare in July of 2015 for $13.5 billion and they asked me to stay on and integrate the businesses.","In the past two years, the team created a very strong combined platform, leveraging the very best of both firms. Now today, OptumRx is a $65 billion business with strong cash flow, a single technology platform and excellent operating leverage. The combination created a true market leader in the PBM space, and I was proud to be part of it.","Candidly, I was not expecting the call from Dentsply Sirona. And I spent a few intense weeks doing due diligence on the company. I scoured the financial statements, inspected the R&D pipeline and reviewed in detail the integration plans and status. The bottom line is I really liked what I found. Dentsply Sirona is the global leader in dental with a 17% market share in a highly fragmented market. The company is the recognized leader in innovation. We're leading the digitization of dentistry.","Dentsply Sirona has a very solid balance sheet, with ample cash and modest leverage. This capital structure provides excellent optionality for management to grow the business through M&A or by returning capital to shareholders through buybacks. In short, I concluded that Dentsply Sirona has everything it needs to significantly outperform the market. And now after spending a month immersing myself in this business, I'm more convinced than ever. All we need to do is execute. So let's talk about execution and what we're going to do.","We'll be using a playbook that is familiar to those of you who followed the Catamaran story. The first and most important thing is fielding the right leadership team. In my first week on the job, we announced the addition of Nick Alexos, as EVP and Chief Administrative Officer, leading a host of corporate functions. Nick co-founded Madison Dearborn Partners, a leading private equity firm, where he spent 29 years, primarily in the healthcare space. Nick served on the board of Sirona Dental Systems for six years, and so he knows our business very well. Personally, I've known Nick for 20 years and he will be a phenomenal leader and a partner as we grow this business together.","We also added Keith Ebling as EVP, Secretary and General Counsel. Keith was most recently EVP and General Counsel with Express Scripts, a $100 billion pharmacy benefit management firm that ranks 22nd on the Fortune 500 list. Keith is one of the brightest and most accomplished GCs in the entire healthcare industry and we're truly fortunate to have him on our team. Beyond Keith's strong legal expertise, his skills in M&A, strategy and supply chain will help us drive our growth agenda.","Nick and Keith are joining a very capable executive team of Bob Size, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Maureen MacInnis, our Chief Human Resources Officer. Beyond our executive team, Dentsply Sirona has a very deep bench of skilled operators and domain experts in the dental industry. I'd stack this team up against anyone.","Page two in our playbook is providing total clarity around what's important. We just spent a week together in Germany with our top 30 business leaders from around the world. There, we constructed our top five priorities, with detailed plans and teams to attack each one. Every single employee in the company now knows what needs to happen, who's accountable and when it will be done.","I'd like to highlight two of our most important priorities for you. Our top priority is reigniting growth. We're going to build a growth engine and reclaim our position as the growth leader in dental. At the heart of it, this strategy is all about allocating capital and sales resources to the highest growth opportunities in the dental marketplace. M&A will also play an important role to add to our strategic footprint.","The second priority I want to talk about is operational excellence. Our goal is to be the best operator in the dental industry in terms of cost, quality and overall efficiency. We're starting with a focus on operating expenses and have put a plan in place to cut an incremental $100 million of costs in 2018 and 2019. Beyond expense control, we intend to drive revenue synergies well beyond this target. You'll see those numbers in our reported revenue growth performance.","In summary, I'm genuinely excited about leading this team. I view this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take the dental industry market leader to a whole new level. And the capable men and women here, inside Dentsply Sirona, really do know the business and they know what to do. I want to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for embracing change and for welcoming me with open arms.","I believe we have the best people, products and technology in the entire dental industry. And now, coupled with a new leadership team and a relentless focus on execution, our future looks very bright. And as I've told many of our people, I truly believe this will be an amazing ride. So now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Uli Michel, who'll provide a more detailed look into the quarterly results and our underlying assumptions for the fourth quarter. Uli?","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. In the third quarter, our reported revenue increased $55 million to $1,009 million, up 5.8%. Foreign exchange movements were a tailwind to revenue of 210 basis points.","Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, increased 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth increased 2.4%, excluding a 190-basis-point favorable impact from net acquisitions. Based on our estimate, overall sales growth was favorably impacted by approximately $8 million during the quarter related to the transition in distribution strategy.","Our growth was driven by strength in the U.S., which grew 7.1%. We are beginning to see the benefit of our expanded distribution agreement in equipment. In anticipation of demand from a successful Dentsply Sirona World, we saw $10 million to $15 million in orders placed ahead of schedule that we originally expected in Q4.","Based on our estimate, in the U.S, year-over-year changes in dealer equipment inventory related to the transition in distribution strategy impacted Q3 sales growth favorably by approximately $18 million. Europe grew 1.7%, driven by strength in Southern Europe, with particular strength in the Russian market. Based on our estimates, year-over-year changes in dealer equipment inventory related to the transition in distribution strategy impacted Q3 sales growth unfavorably by approximately $5 million in Europe.","Rest of World declined 2.9%, driven by lower sales in Australia and in Canada. Canada has also been impacted by the transition to expand the distribution. We estimate the year-over-year changes in dealer equipment inventory related to the transition in distribution strategy to have impacted Q3 sales growth unfavorably by approximately $5 million in this region. We expect our performance to rebound here beginning in the fourth quarter.","As you will see in the 10-Q, this quarter, we began reporting three segments instead of two, as previous management reorganized the business in Q3. Our first segment, Chairside Consumables & Endo, grew 4.3%. Our second segment, Implants, CAD\/CAM, Prosthetics & Healthcare, declined 1.1% on an internal basis. Our implant business drove the decline versus growth in all the other areas. Our third segment, Imaging, Treatment Centers & Orthodontics, had internal growth of 5.3%.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 120 basis points to 55.9% from 54.7% in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 59.1%, up 130 basis points for the quarter. The increase was associated with a more favorable product mix. Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $430.5 million, up $51.4 million or 13.6% versus last year.","Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $379.4 million or 37.9% of sales, excluding precious metals, up 90 basis points from last year, driven by increased selling expenses. In total, GAAP operating income was $107.9 million, down from $126.6 million last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 21.1%, up 30 basis points compared to 20.8% last year.","On an adjusted basis, which excludes the tax impact on non-GAAP items, our effective tax rate was 18.4%, with tax expense of $37 million this year versus an expense of $31.3 million last year and an effective tax rate of 16.8%. Last year's low Q3 rate included the year-to-date true-up. For the full year 2017, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 18%.","Q3 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $90.6 million, down from $92.5 million last year. Third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS was $0.39 compared to $0.39 diluted GAAP EPS in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income increased 5.6% to $164.3 million. As Mark mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.70 compared to $0.66 last year. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release.","I will now discuss elements of the cash flow statement this quarter, highlighting the key drivers. Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $164.4 million. The increase over last year was mainly driven by higher adjusted net income, excluding non-cash items. We view this as a key metric and one of our strategies is to improve our cash flows.","Cash used in investing activities was $43.9 million, of which, capital expenditures were $33.8 million for the quarter. We expect to utilize our balance sheet as key value driver for our stakeholders. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million. Now turning to guidance. We are narrowing our guidance range to $2.65 to $2.70. Even at the low end of the range, our guidance implies over 20% adjusted EPS growth in the fourth quarter.","Our guidance includes the following assumptions. Full year constant currency sales growth of around 2%. This includes approximately 200 basis points of net benefit from acquisitions, implying flat internal growth for the year. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of approximately $3.95 billion. This implies between 4% and 5% internal growth in Q4.","We expect to exit the year with momentum heading into 2018. Our EPS range implies a full year diluted share count of approximately 233 million shares versus the 222 million in 2016. This reflects approximately $0.09 headwinds from share count. We anticipate FX headwinds of $0.08 to $0.10 for 2017. Overall, this was a solid quarter both from a financial and operational standpoint and we are pleased with our results.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark?","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Uli. Obviously, as Uli said, we feel good about the progress in the quarter and our outlook for the full year and we now have the entire company aligned around our top five priorities and focused on executing. Before we close out the call, I want to take a moment to announce that Uli will be retiring to spend more time with his family back in Germany.","Uli has been with the company since 2013 and has played a significant role in facilitating the merger and all the integration work to-date for Dentsply Sirona. We thank Uli for all of his help in bringing these two companies together and wish him much success in his retirement. Effective next week, Nick Alexos will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer. Uli will remain with the company until the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition.","I'll now turn the call back to the operator and we'll take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to John Kreger, William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Mark, welcome to the world of dental. Can you maybe just expand a bit on your comments about the due diligence work you did? I'd just be curious. What is your view about the longer-term growth opportunity in the dental market? And maybe if you could expand on where you see the biggest kind of revenue cross-selling opportunities for you guys to sort of grow, hopefully, in excess of the market trends. Thanks.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, John. It's good to talk to you again. Well, you know that I'm all about growth and that's been my fastball for 20 years. And so I came here after this diligence work to drive growth. And we've built a specific plan to reignite this growth engine, as I called it. And I'll walk you through at a high level exactly what we're doing. The first thing we're focused on is strengthening the frame. And here, I talk about building an integrated operating model, really forming a springboard for growth going forward. We're going to get focused on our sales force and our sales force effectiveness. We have 4,000 reps in the field and this is a major asset for the company.","So how do we train, measure and incentivize this huge investment and drive new levels of return on that investment? Part of my diligence included a deep dive on the new product pipeline. And this is one of the areas where the company excels. Our challenge now is how do we allocate the biggest bets to the biggest opportunities? Where are those areas for the largest opportunities for outsized growth in the market? And that work is in full swing right now.","We also have a strategy around channels. And here, we're talking about building on and optimizing our relationships with leadership companies like Henry Schein and Patterson. You look at their footprints and their footprints with the dentists. They really do have amazing relationships and very strong footprints. And so we're looking to take those relationships to a whole another level. I'd also say part of our growth strategy focuses on the DSO market. And here, we intend to take an enterprise approach, treat this market segment discreetly and treat them like a true national account, bringing a one company enterprise approach to that market.","And the last area, John, which I know you've followed the Catamaran story, so you know this is part of the playbook, will be M&A. And here, our strategy will be all around buying growth, both buying earnings growth and revenue growth over time. We'll add to the strategic footprint as required and these will be accretive acquisitions. Those are the kind I like. I would say that from an M&A standpoint, we're not really missing anything, so we'll be opportunistic. And I wouldn't expect us to be moving into the M&A space in the near term. But this will be something in 2018 that we'll be taking a hard look at. Hopefully that answers your question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Mark. Welcome back. Good to reconnect.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Robert.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, just on some of the updates you gave around cost cutting and the revenue synergies. I just want to make sure I understood correctly. It sounds like you think there's an incremental $100 million of cost in 2018 and 2019. Is that on top of the $75 million that was previously communicated or is that kind of the new target there? And then on the revenue side, your intention to drive synergies beyond the $100 million, can you maybe just give a little bit more on the areas of growth you're particularly targeting there? And then, any potential timeline would be really helpful. Thanks.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Robert, and it's good to reconnect. Yeah. This is one of the things that jumped out at me in the diligence. There's a lot of room in the income statement and there's no doubt about that. The team has done a nice job already of driving tens of millions of dollars of synergy into the run rate. So, good work has been done. But what I'm talking about is, in fact, an additional $100 million starting today going forward on top of what's already embedded in the run rate. So, we would expect from a timeframe standpoint to do this over calendar year 2018 and 2019.","Now the way we're doing it is really restarting the integration management office and sort of going to the playbook that I've used in the past. We're looking at eliminating redundancies. We're looking fresh at manufacturing site consolidation, more efficient use of head count. And I think you could just call it better overall hygiene of how we manage our costs. So Nick Alexos and Bob Size are leading this effort and I've sat down with them. They promised me that they won't let you down. So that's the game plan. We're going to attack this with a whole new level of vigor.","Now on revenue synergies, we do have a bunch of work in-flight to drive new revenue synergies. And I've had some good examples already since the merger happened 18 months ago. And we have substantial opportunity here. But you know when you drive revenue synergies through new product, the timeline is longer and it will take time to surface on the revenue line. So I do see tens of millions of dollars of revenue synergy. And you'll see it coming through in our financial results on the revenue line. So hopefully that answered the question. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Mark, maybe I want to follow up on that last point. I think a key point in the debate is just how fast the Sirona business can grow. That's heavily dependent on CAD\/CAM, had been growing mid to high-single-digits prior to the merger. I'm curious as to what your view is of the steady-state growth of the Sirona business is. What your view is on potential reacceleration there? Is that dependent on new products to reaccelerate the growth? And if you could also maybe just talk about the context of that business and increasing competition from the scanner players, that might be helpful too.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay, Tycho. Thanks for the questions. So I was in Bensheim, I mentioned, with our whole leadership team. I had a chance to walk through the factory where we make the CEREC gear, all of the imaging gear, and it is staggering to see what we've built. And so, this is the future of the business. This is the future of the industry. And we do see growth in CAD\/CAM. I do believe we continue to lead digital dentistry broadly. And the market is headed in this direction. We see growth in both CAD\/CAM as well as the image capture and the whole technology that front-ends this.","And so we're making big bets in this area, part of the area that I talked about in terms of R&D prioritization. And when we align our investment dollars opposite growth opportunities, this is where we're going to have outsized investment in terms of new product development. I think one thing I'd like to share is actually \u2013 it's anecdotal, but it's a little bit of my own personal story. So my dentist in Chicago is a fully digital CEREC dentist. And so he owns all the gear. He has an acquisition unit where he captured a digital image using Omnicam of my tooth.","This just happened a few months ago. He actually had me walk into the other room. He sent that image to the milling machine. And I watched the machine cut my tooth out of Zirconia. And I was out of there in one and 1.5 hours. So as a consumer, this single-visit dentistry model is very powerful. And when I asked him about, what does this mean to you? What's the benefit to you, my dentist?","He told me he was doing 80 crowns a month and that the level of efficiency and the time that he saves and the improvement in his practice is off the charts. And I have to say that, for me, I don't have a lot of time. And getting in and out of there an hour and a half one-time was wildly compelling. So there's a lot of growth and a lot of opportunity in this space and we're going to place big bets on it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. And I'll reiterate the welcome aboard to all the new faces there. I want to touch on just one point here in Q&A and its growth. It should be helpful to get a sense from you how you've seen things evolve on a couple of dynamics that are growth related and how they've impacted your thinking on the implied change to the fourth quarter outlook? I mean, one would be market growth. Anything you've seen there makes you feel any differently relative to the thinking over the course of this summer on hardware or consumables and then inventory. What's the underlying thinking on inventory as a component of revenue growth from here? Thanks.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Well, maybe I'll take a swing at 4Q and how we landed where we landed and then ask for some help from Uli on inventory. So, as I said, when I came in, and as part of our announcement, we reiterated guidance on October 2. We'd have had a different action if I'd have seen that we had a problem. I knew it was in the range. And so today, when we look at the fourth quarter, we pressure tested this pretty hard. I will tell you that my goal, my personal goal is to position this company for a strong 2018. And we're not intending to mortgage our future here just for a outperformance in the fourth quarter. So, as I said, we feel good about the third quarter. We feel very good about the fourth quarter and the full year outlook.","Now, as you asked the second part of your question regarding inventory, from my standpoint, I look at the balance sheet and I look at how much inventory we have on it. I look at our inventory turn ratio. We have opportunities to improve how we manage inventory in this business. And as it comes to our channel partners, it's never been our job to manage our partner's inventory. And our goal is to manage our business as efficiently as possible. And we do that through the best demand planning process that we can possibly build. So, Uli, maybe some comments on inventory?","Ulrich Michel - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Again, as Mark mentioned, it's our distributors who manage their inventory. But, of course, when we give guidance and do our forecast, we have to make assumptions on what their sell-through might be and what they will order from us consequently. So when we put together our guidance, last time, we had originally anticipated that there would be a reduction in dealer inventory in Q3. What we told you now is that our current belief is that overall inventory for equipment in distributors that are related to this channel transition increased by about $8 million. We came up approximately $18 million in the U.S. and we're down $5 million each in Europe and Rest of World.","A big part of this is what I also mentioned in the prepared remarks, a purchase by the North American distributors in anticipation of a very strong DS world, which we had originally modeled to be purchased in the fourth quarter. So we have this, call it, $10 million to $15 million that came in the third quarter and made the inventory change a positive in the third quarter. What we, at the moment, model for the fourth quarter is basically a reduction in the same magnitude than last year. Last year, in the fourth quarter, distributors reduced equipment inventory in the magnitude of $30 million and we would anticipate there to be a similar reduction now. Hope this answers your questions, Steve?","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next is from Erin Wright, Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. To the extent, I guess, you can speak to it, can you parse out kind of the North American trends in consumables right now and what sort of visibility I guess you have on that metric and sort of underlying demand trends, more so from a consumables perspective parsing out all sort of the channel dynamics? Thanks.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yes, Erin. I will address this. It's been very interesting. I've been reading everything on in terms of transcripts and everything everyone is saying just like you and also doing research on the market data. What I'm finding is there isn't good market data available on consumables. And it's kind of stunning that it sort of doesn't exist. But the way I gather my instinct on it is by talking to customers and I've done so already with our major distributors and spoken with each of the leaders as well as some large DSOs, some large buyers.","And my sense is that we should expect low single-digit type growth in the consumable space. I believe it's driven both by price and volume. And I do think that when it's all done we should be growing faster than the market. So that's not a specific answer to your question, because there's not good data available, but that's my horse sense.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson, Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Uli, let me just start with you and say I wish you much health and happiness in the future. It's been nice working with you. Mark, a couple questions for you. I guess I'll ask a two-parter here.","One, when I look at biggest opportunities on the revenue side, dental implant stands out quite a bit. To me, that market seems to be growing mid-single-digit. You guys seem to be lagging it by maybe a 10 full points at this point or so. So just what would be the plan there or what do you see is the opportunities there?","And then on the $100 million in cost cuts over the next two years, would you commit to updating us on that fairly regularly, providing us progress reports? And maybe you could help us understand one or two of the biggest levers in those cost cuts over the next two years? Thank you","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay. Jeff, good questions, and I'll address them both. On implants, this is a big market and a very attractive market. And we're paying attention to what our competitors are doing. And we are underperforming, in my opinion. We do have a full product line. We've got very high-quality products. And so this is an execution issue. And for some of you who've followed the Catamaran story, you know that my bias is to run to the fire. So we have already begun a deep inspection and operating review of the implant business and we have a plan to get it back on track very, very quickly. This is an attractive market and we should be leading in this market.","Relative to the synergy numbers and providing you regular updates, the best regular update will be in our earnings per share that you'll see reported on a quarterly basis. I am happy to give you sort of a general update on where we're tracking. The areas of cost savings are up and down the income statement, all the way from cost of goods through our SG&A. There isn't an element of the business that we can't perform better and this is what I talk about in terms of good hygiene. So I think on our quarterly calls, I will be open to giving you some insight into status. But we'll get this $100 million into the P&L in 2018 and 2019. Next question?","Operator","Next is from Jon Block, Stifel.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll also have a two-parter and it's sort of both follow-ups to earlier questions. Maybe first just to start, the 4.3% consumable number, the internal growth seems particularly solid, especially considering some of the adverse weather in the quarter. Maybe if you can talk about if there was any buy ahead of a price increase or do you think that really is representative of the market? And then just going back to that incremental $100 million in expense savings, Mark, in 2018 and 2019, how do we think of that in terms of the cadence? Is it somewhat linear or is it back-end weighted as you continue to sort of scrub the various business units? Thanks, guys.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay, Jon. Thanks for the question. Yeah. The performance on the consumable business was \u2013 we were pretty happy. And was there a big buy ahead? No. There wasn't. We did see an effect for the weather issues. The hurricane probably had 100 bps negative impact on the U.S. market. So hopefully that addresses your consumable question.","On the $100 million and how to place it into your model on a calendar basis, I'm probably not going to be specific on exactly how it's going to flow through. I'll tell you we'll have cost savings that we'll realize through the balance of this year. We have some immediate opportunities to improve and save money. And then, I do think it will be pretty ratable over that two-year period. When you start thinking about potential site consolidations, there's a longer tail to some of these actions. But in terms of expense management and just better hygiene, that will take some time to run into the P& L, but we'll get it done in 2018 and 2019. Next question?","Operator","Next is from Brandon Couillard, Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Mark, curious to hear your perspective on the types of investments you think are needed in the business to sort of reinvigorate the growth equation. And, secondly, how you really plan to measure the effectiveness of M&A, whether that's in terms of ROIC or market share. And how much opportunity you really see across the fragmented landscape. Thank you.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay, Brandon. Well, maybe I'll just start with a framework that I've used in my career as it relates to investment and allocating capital, making choices. The first place we allocate capital here is in our base business. And here, I'm talking about extracting cost turnaround and invest it in technology, key people, activities and efficiencies in the business to create a leaner, meaner operating machine to grow from. From there, I believe in allocating capital to M&A. And these are accretive acquisitions to strengthen the footprint. I mentioned this earlier. The third place I look is then share buybacks. And now with the stock cheap and I'd view it as cheap, it is an attractive alternative and one that we intend to continue. And then, finally, there would be dividends. And so that's the capital deployment strategy.","Now as it relates to investments and M&A, we have a detailed plan and a heat map already built. Dentsply Sirona has a lot of experience in M&A. And in my last run, we bought 12 companies. And so I bring a view on M&A. And then when you combine it with Nick Alexos and Keith Ebling, both of whom have deep M&A skills, we have a machine that we've built that's pretty well equipped to look at allocating capital and buying growth. And so, hopefully, this is responsive, but sort of in rank order, we're buying growth to drive revenue and earnings growth. We're buying technology to help our product line be successful in a dentist's office. We are buying capabilities to fill out our strategic footprint, and I don't think we need a lot. And we are focused on accretive acquisitions.","So I hope that helps you understand how we're thinking about putting investments to work. How will we measure them? You'll measure them in EPS growth. And we do have an ROIC model that we use inside the business. Everything's got to clear hurdle rate. We're focused on our weighted average cost of capital. We know what kind of hurdles we need to pass to drive shareholder value. And we put that up against every analysis. We put that up against a share buyback model. So the drill on allocating capital is a pretty well thought out set of calisthenics. And we've got a lot of help around here helping us think about that. Next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Yi Chen, H. C. Wainwright.","Yi Chen - H. C. Wainwright & Co. LLC","Thank you. Regarding distribution, apart from the agreement with Henry Schein, is Dentsply contemplating something else to become less reliant on Patterson?","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that question. Well, first of all, I'll just tell you I had a 2.5 hour meeting with Stanley Bergman a couple weeks ago. And it was a \u2013 there was a lot of excitement in the room on his part and mine. We are both very committed to this relationship. And, candidly, the change in the U.S. equipment market for Schein \u2013 they've been waiting for this for a very long time. So these folks who call on so many dentists in the United States, they know our products well. And, candidly, they're off to a very strong start with this new distribution agreement that we've put in place.","And as it relates to Patterson, I will tell you that they are an equally important partner of ours. And we've had a very unique relationship with Patterson, as you well know, for a very long time in North America. And they're committed to growing. They're committed with us. The changes they've had, I view, is very positive. Mark Walchirk, who's the incoming CEO, is a friend from McKesson. I've done business with him over the years. And they have a very strong leader in Mark. He's totally the right guy for that job. And we're looking forward to spending some quality time with the Patterson executive team and figuring out how to take that business relationship to a whole another level. So, in short, we do plan to make changes to the relationship that includes improving our working relationship and trying to expand that relationship as we work together.","Operator","We'll go next to David Stratton, Great Lakes Review.","David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Back to the $100 million in synergies, I just like you to parse out any differences. So the company had previously communicated around $125 million in cost synergies in the first three years of the merger. Now you're saying $100 million on top of the tens of millions that have already been realized. And I was wondering if you could bridge what has been realized with what is expected and quantify any difference from what has previously been communicated to us?","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, let me try it this way. We've accomplished tens of millions of dollars of synergies. They are in the run rate and they are in the P&L. Good work is going on. Now we're starting from today and moving forward and what we're saying is there will be an incremental $100 million of operating costs that will come out of the P&L in 2018 and 2019.","So there's no overlap \u2013 this is incremental to what's already been done. And that will be executed through this IMO that I described. You'll see it run into the P&L over a two-year period. And then in addition to that, the revenue synergies we talked a little about will run on top of that and you'll see them surface on the revenue line. So hopefully, David, that's a little more clarity around our synergy commitments. Next question?","Operator","With no further questions, I'd like to turn things back to Mr. Thierer for closing remarks.","Mark A. Thierer - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, great. Thank you very much for joining us on our call and we look forward to speaking to you all in February. Have a good day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call Mr. John Sweeney. You may begin, sir.","John Sweeney","Thank you Kevin and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. I remind you that the earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available on our website at www.dentsplysirona. com.","Our earnings call presentation and any of the numbers discussed today will be non-GAAP financial measures and there are reconciliations provided in our press release and in our earnings deck. But before we begin please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release.","During today's conference call we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results and we base those statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.","Donald Casey","Thanks, John, and thank all of you for joining us on our earnings call. To start, I wanted to take a minute and provide some perspective on the year we just completed. Looking back at 2018, while our financial results were clearly disappointing, we have taken important steps to put the Company on a better path.","To improve our performance and deliver consistent growth, we completed an in-depth analysis of the dental market, our Company and the areas we need to improve on going forward. Based on that analysis, we announced a comprehensive restructuring program in November and have worked aggressively to deliver against that plan.","We strongly believe that executing against the road map we've laid out will better position Dentsply Sirona to deliver for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. On this call, we will discuss our performance in 2018, provide guidance for 2019 and update you on the progress we are making against our restructuring plan.","Let's start by looking at our performance for fiscal year 2018. As you can see on Slide 6, odds [ph] in our dealer inventory in our Technology & Equipment segment, this revenue decline was significant, saw relative stability on the Consumables side. Our lower top line and margin pressure drove an adjusted operating income margin of 15.5% and adjusted EPS of $2.01.","Operating cash flow was $500 million during the year, reflecting the strong underlying cash flow generating capabilities of Dentsply Sirona.","Turning now to the fourth quarter of 2018 on Slide 7, revenues were $1.05 billion, which were about flat on an internal basis. We achieved this level of revenue performance, despite the substantial dealer destocking that we experienced during the quarter. Adjusted operating income margin came in at 16.8%, down 510 basis points compared to the prior year and adjusted EPS was $0.58.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Nick Alexos , who will discuss the financials and outlook for 2019. Nick?","Nick Alexos","Thank you, Don. And good morning, everybody. We announced that we will be filing our 2018 Form 10-K after today's deadline. We needed additional time to review the accounting results and related internal controls of a business that is being shut down as part of our portfolio shaping initiatives. The discontinued business is immaterial to our consolidated net sales and we anticipate filing our Form 10-K next week.","If you go to Slide 9, we report across two segments, Consumables and Technology & Equipment. Our Consumables segment accounted for 45% of our revenue for the fourth quarter and represents a diverse portfolio of products that provide steady growth at stable margin.","In Q4, Consumable revenues were $476 million, up 3.4% compared to prior year, and up 5.4% on an internal basis. Consumable revenue growth was partially driven by recovery of the operational issues at our European Distribution Center in Venlo, the Netherlands.","This important distribution facility is now more effectively serving our customers in the European markets. The increased overall Consumable revenue performance also drove Consumable segment margins up 85 basis points, as compared to the 2017 fourth quarter.","If we go to Slide 10, we highlight our Technology & Equipment segment, which accounted for 55% of revenue in the fourth quarter. Our T&E segment has numerous unique equipment technologies and includes our implant and Wellspect HealthCare businesses. Q4 T&E revenues were $574 million, down 7.5% versus prior year and down 4.1% on an internal basis.","In this segment, we had planned for and previously discussed, some significant revenue reductions during the year due to dealer inventory destocking. We had $31 million of dealer destocking in the fourth quarter as opposed to $21 million of stocking in the prior year fourth quarter for a net reduction in year-over-year revenue growth of $52 million.","Excluding the stocking and destocking in both years, T&E would have posted 4.3% growth in the fourth quarter of '18. We are encouraged by the level of end user retail equipment sales that we have seen in the marketplace, particularly in the US. In the quarter, we also had positive year-over-year growth in implants and our Wellspect HealthCare business saw solid growth up mid-single digits.","Technology & Equipment operating margins were 9.7%, as compared to 21.6% in the prior-year quarter. The significant margin compression was a result of the following factors. Net inventory destocking reduced the T&E margins by 500 basis points; product mix and pricing, particularly in our imaging business reduced margins by an additional 600 basis points; businesses that are part of our portfolio shaping in the fourth quarter, reduced our margins by 200 basis points. These were partially offset by savings from our cost reductions and that with some other - 00 basis points on our margin, making up the margin differential.","Slide 11 goes through our regional performance. As you can see, US revenues were $310 million, down 15% compared to prior year and down 16.3% on an internal sales growth basis in the quarter, mainly due to the inventory destocking in our Technology & Equipment businesses. In addition, we saw declines in our Consumables business in the US, due to a difficult prior year comparison as the prior year quarter benefited from a pull forward of revenues from Q1 of 2018.","European revenues were $457 million, up 4.6% compared to a prior year, and up 8.7% on an internal growth basis. This was driven to some degree by strong consumable sales and also as a result of the recovery from the Venlo distribution center. And in addition, there was some strong benefit in our treatment business in Europe.","Rest of world revenues were $283 million, up 1.4% compared to prior year, and up 7.1% on an internal basis. As you can see, our global platform allows us to benefit from faster growing international markets.","Slide 12 is our financial summary on a non-GAAP basis. Revenues excluding precious metals were $1.050 billion, down 2.7% in the fourth quarter, but roughly flat on an internal growth basis.","Once again, the fourth quarter of 2018 had a $52 million year-over-year net stocking, destocking equipment effect. So excluding this factor, total revenues would have increased by 4.7% on an internal basis.","Gross profit was $571.7 million or 54.4%, down 370 basis points as compared to the prior-year. Pricing pressure, negative mix, particularly in our imaging business, have reduced our margins by 230 basis points. In addition, we had 80 basis points negative impact from our equipment inventory destocking and 40 basis points of margin reduction due to businesses that are part of our portfolio shaping initiatives in the fourth quarter.","Total operating expenses, which include R&D were $395.6 million, up 1.2%, as compared to the prior year or 4.3% on a constant currency basis. The higher SG&A costs were principally due to restructuring and investments and expenses related to the build-out of our new organization and additional R&D expenses ahead of the IDS in March.","Adjusted non-GAAP operating margin declined to 16.8%, down 510 basis points year-over-year, as a result of our lower gross profit margin and increased SG&A expenses. We did achieve $70 million of cost reductions during the year and anticipate that the balance of our targeted savings will flow into our newly announced restructuring program. Q4 adjusted EPS was $0.58, down from $0.82 in the prior-year quarter.","Slide 13 is our cash flow for Q4 2018. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $202.1 million, down 11.7%. We had capital expenditures of $52 million in Q4, resulting in a free cash flow of $150.2 million. Our 2018 free cash flow finished quite strong, with a $63 million contribution from lower inventory levels that we achieved during the fourth quarter of 2018. I would note, that with this reduction, we far exceed our inventory goals for 2018.","For the full-year 2018, the Company achieved operating cash flow of approximately $500 million and free cash flow after CapEx of $317.2 million. As we look forward, we continue to have incremental opportunities to drive strong cash flows and anticipate taking additional cash flow out of our working capital in 2019.","Moving on to guidance on Slide 14. Our reported revenue guidance for 2019 is a range of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion. This reflects an underlying internal growth rate of 4% to 5% over 2018. It should be noted that there are about $70 million of revenue in 2018 that will not reoccur in 2019, due to our portfolio shaping initiatives. Furthermore, foreign exchange will have a negative impact on 2019 revenues of 2.5% or $100 million, assuming current rates for the remainder of the year.","Once again, 2018 dealer destocking was a $100 million headwind to 2018 revenues. A recovery from the 2018 destocking is expected to favorably impact 2019 by 2.5%. Longer-term, we anticipate achieving a 3% to 4% internal growth rate consistent with the target provided as part of our previously announced restructuring plan.","Our adjusted gross profit margin will improve from roughly 56% in 2018 to about 57% in 2019, reflecting higher revenues, savings from restructuring initiatives, portfolio trimming, and a positive FX impact.","We expect to achieve 2019 operating expenses below last year, as we committed to you in our prior earnings call. Our 2019 guidance also reflects restructuring expected recurrent savings of approximately $60 million and one-time restructuring expenditures of $120 million in cash.","Taking the 100 basis points of gross margin improvement plus the net operating expense leverage versus revenue growth, we anticipate an operating profit margin in the range of 17% to 18% for the full-year 2019, as compared to 15.5% for 2018. Our tax rate assumption for 2019 is 22.4%. And adding all this together, brings us to an adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 in the range of $2.25 to $2.40[ph].","With respect to the quarterly phasing in 2019, one key factor is the Biannual International Dental Show, IDS, which is held this March. In IDS years we typically see a slowing in our Q1 revenue growth, as dentists hold off their purchases until the show. As a result, we anticipate lower revenue versus prior year in the first quarter, ramping up as we move through the second and third and fourth quarters of the year.","Gross margin is anticipated to be lowest in the first quarter, due to the timing of shipments and the timing of our restructuring savings, both of which will accelerate through the year.","SG&A will also be higher in the first quarter of 2019. This is a result of the timing of expenses related to the IDS and investments in new products. We anticipate the benefit of our restructuring savings to positively impact our SG&A levels as we move past the first quarter.","Overall, I'm pleased with the progress of our restructuring and other initiatives in 2019 and I appreciate the exceptional work of our employees globally.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Don. Thank you.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Nick. As you can see, our guidance for 2019 shows that with improved revenue and focus on operating discipline, we achieved significant earnings leverage. To discuss those plans, I will now move to Slide 16. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, 2018 was a year of significant change.","An important milestone for the organization was laying out our priorities for a comprehensive restructuring plan that is focused on accelerating growth, improving margins while simplifying the organization. The foundation of that plan starts with creating a compelling vision for the Company and building a world-class leadership team.","Toward that goal, one of the critical accomplishments of the organization during 2018 was moving to a singular, simplified leadership structure. This allows us to act as one company with one view of where we're going and how we're going to operate in the future. This also significantly enhances our visibility and accountability.","Further in 2018, in addition to simplifying our organization structure, we have focused on upgrading talent. The leadership team, we have both blends, experience and a track record of delivering results. Our senior commercial leaders, Bill Newell and Walter Petersohn, bring a lot of experience and expertise in their roles of Chief Segment Officer and Chief Commercial Officer respectively.","We are also benefiting from new thinking around integrating our supply chain with the addition of Dan Key, our Chief Supply Chain Officer. Additionally, I am very happy to announce the addition of Cort Stellar [ph] as our new Chief Technology Officer.","Moving to Slide 17, we have provided our strategy and our organizational priorities. We believe that Dentsply Sirona will win in the marketplace when we leverage our unique breadth and depth to provide innovative solutions for our customers globally. Going forward, we have three simple organizational priorities, which I've mentioned, growing revenue, improving margins and simplifying the organization.","So let's review some of the details that support those priorities. In order to grow the focus on organizational simplification, productivity and R&D, enhancing our commercial capabilities and continuing to feed important and growing regions where we operate, we have leaned out our organizational structure by consolidating our 11 SBUs into five product groups and created a single supply chain organization and we have simplified our regional commercial structure.","We will continue to report in two segments, Consumables and Technology & Equipment. However, beginning in first quarter of 2019, our instrument and ortho businesses are moving from Consumables into the Technology & Equipment segment.","And our prosthetics business is moving from Technology & Equipment to the Consumables segment. By making these changes, we group our products in a way to better unlock natural synergies between business lines.","Innovation is our lifeblood and there have been significant changes to how we approach developing innovative solutions and technologies. Our R&D process now begins with a top-down portfolio management process. This allows us to focus on developing larger and more impactful initiatives at a faster pace. It means we will align resources across the organization to reflect the biggest opportunities.","It also means that we will start looking to create synergies between our innovation efforts to take advantage of our unique breadth in the category. A great example of this new approach is in the CAD\/CAM area. Over the past year, we've overhauled our strategy and are now committed to growing both our Chairside franchise and vigorously competing in the DI space.","We are in the process of introducing a complete portfolio of products that gives us strong entries across the entire spectrum. This starts with PrimeScan, a launch that we are able to accelerate by leveraging our focused R&D approach. PrimeScan is lightning fast, easy to use and takes high quality digital impressions.","This breakthrough leads to faster and more streamlined Chairside CEREC restorations. The feedback we've received from dentists that have experienced this product is overwhelmingly positive. And PrimeScan is a truly open platform. So we now have a DI system that can create high quality digital impressions that could be used by all the major lab-based CAD\/CAM manufacturing systems.","We are also enhancing Omnicam with new software that improves performance and offering that system later this year for $29,995, which makes it extremely competitive with DI other systems, particularly when you factor in we do not charge any annual fees and we do not have any per scan fees.","Moving to Slide 19, to talk about clear aligners. At the Chicago Midwinter, we introduced our new SureSmile aligner software. This SureSmile system combines clinically superior planning capabilities with state-of-the-art manufacture.","SureSmile aligners and planning software deliver a complete clinician controlled clear aligner treatment solution. The reception to the software launch was very enthusiastic and we're optimistic that SureSmile will ramp as we move through the rest of the year.","In addition to innovation, enhancing our commercial capabilities has been a major area of emphasis over the last year. At the heart of this initiative is improving our sales force execution or SFE. Our SFE program is built around a comprehensive segmentation strategy that allows us to identify high-value customers, create a common view to that customer across all Dentsply Sirona's sales forces, move to a common CRM platform and implement an incentive structure that focuses on bringing the breadth of the Dentsply Sirona's portfolio to the dentists.","It also involves creating a much more analytical approach to targeting, call planning and performance evaluation. This program is rolled out at a recent national meeting and the reception has been very enthusiastic. We will also continue invest in high growth parts of the world.","Turning to our second operational priority, improving margins, an important initiative is to centralize our supply chain across the entire company. We have lots of institutional knowledge and expertise to get this job done and we're supplementing that with new leadership.","We've mentioned that includes the addition of Dan Key to our management team as our Chief Supply Chain Officer and Dan has already started leading our efforts to create a single integrated supply chain responsible for all manufacturing, global demand planning, logistics, distribution and procurement as well as other critical areas.","As we said, part of our SBU and RCO consolidation efforts and margin improvement programs, we are targeting a net headcount reduction of 6% to 8% by 2021, that will bring us down to between 15,000 and 15,300 employees from the roughly 16,300 employees we had in November 2018.","We have made very difficult decisions in accordance with this effort since announcing the restructuring plan and we will continue to work with our employees and Works Council to determine the best outcome.","At this point, our headcount reduction are tracking ahead of plan and we've achieved an employee target of less than 16,000 at the end of fiscal 2019. And we are on track to achieve our goal of 15,000 to 15,300 by the end of 2020.","Another way, we are working to improve margins through portfolio shaping. We are taking advantage of opportunities to exit underperforming businesses and thus reduce cost and complexity. We are in the process of discontinuing our [indiscernible] business which was losing money, and it's been a significant drain on the organization.","We also exit CCAD which was a joint venture with a software developer and we are divesting a surgical and respiratory business that was non-core. This is an ongoing effort as we assess additional candidates for portfolio shaping with a focus on improving top line growth and cost savings. We will announce additional portfolio shaping activities in the coming months.","So in summary, the plan we laid out is focus on delivering a simplified organization while accelerating growth and improving market margins. With the plan this comprehensive, it is imperative that we provide visibility to the progress we are making, and in November, we provided some non-financial metrics and these are on Slide 23.","Reviewing progress against these KPIs. First, we start with the significant progress we've made in the SBU and RCO consolidation. We completed the majority of the steps in these consolidations and have been operating under the new improved structure since January. Our R&D portfolio consolidation is under way and we've had some early wins with PrimeScan, our GP Ortho software and much more to come at IDS later in March.","We've implemented our sales force effectiveness program in the US and continue to drive clinical education. As we've discussed, we've taken clear decisive steps in shaping our portfolio, exiting three underperforming businesses and additional actions are under way. We are working through our headcount reductions and are on target to achieve the full 6% to 8% reductions before the end of 2020. Again, that is ahead of schedule.","As you can see, we hit the ground running after our announcement in November and we will keep this momentum going. That said, our entire management team recognizes the size of the task ahead and we do not expect progress to measured in a straight line.","On Slide 24 we've outlined our financial target expectations for our restructuring plan. In terms of revenue growth, we maintain our view that Consumables will have steady growth of 2% to 3%. We anticipate Technology & Equipment returning to growth this year, partially as a result of resolving our 2018 inventory destocking and the launch of substantial innovations. We project this segment will grow at 4% or even more going forward.","Considering these factors and some of the progress we are making, we maintain that this will result in Dentsply Sirona revenue growth at or above market with our target of 3% to 4%, with operating margins of 20% by the end of 2020 and 22% by 2022, with additional improvements thereafter.","2019 will be a year focused on execution. We expect to accelerate EPS growth in the near term as we act on cost saving opportunities. And as we've shown in our 2019 guidance, growing revenue with expense discipline, with strong EPS leverage. Additionally, it's important for us to maintain an investment grade rating to enable us to best utilize our balance sheet going forward. We are providing this level of detail on metrics over the next few years, because our Board and management team is committed to increasing transparency of our plans and ultimately successfully executing.","These past few months have reaffirmed my belief that this is a great company with world-class talent operating in an attractive market. Our leaders and employees around the globe are working with urgency and a strong sense of purpose. We are confident in the progress we have made and we will continue to take decisive actions needed to deliver on our commitments. We look forward to continue to update on our progress throughout 2019.","And with that, we will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks, good morning.","Donald Casey","Hi, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard","Don, clearly, you seem to be making quite a bit of progress on the restructuring front. Just curious if you could just sort of speak to your level of confidence in the outlook, and particularly the guiding of above the street for 2019. And secondly for Nick, could you sort of quantify the impact on OpEx from the portfolio shaping? And perhaps speak to the magnitude of the additional opportunities planned later this year?","Donald Casey","Sure. Obviously, Brandon, we feel 2019 it's critical for us to deliver on our commitments. That's both internal, to our partners, to our customers and to the investment community. So when we set the guidance this year, we felt that it was critical that we are able to deliver on that commitment. So we have a high level of confidence in doing it. Now I did say that, as we look out over the year, we have a lot of work to do.","And as we head into IDS, a lot of the work that we've been doing from an R&D perspective, really comes to fruition there. A lot of the cost savings and portfolio shaping, it was kind of happened and we expect that to happen over the next couple of quarters. So we recognize there's a lot of work to do. But that being said, we feel very good about this guidance. Obviously, we know it's a really critical year for us and that's why we set the guidance where we did, and we look forward to going and executing.","Nick Alexos","Hi, Brandon. How are you? Yes. In terms of the portfolio trimming, as we mentioned, $70 million of revenue in 2018 is being eliminated, and there's about $10 million to $20 million of savings, mostly in OpEx that goes along with that portfolio trimming. We continue to look at opportunities in '19, but that's the year-over-year impact '18 versus our guidance.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. And then there's also been some I'd say mixed data points, at least as far as the US Dental consumables market stands. Do you sort of speak to what you're seeing in the US market? And could you quantify the impact of the Venlo recovery on consumables in the fourth quarter?","Donald Casey","Yes. Brandon, we'll split that one, Nick I'll answer the second, I'll answer the first. It's interesting. Our US consumables business was down a little bit versus prior year. It's down off a comparator that we mentioned in the script, that where we had seen some pull forward of Q1 2018 into Q4 2017.","So some of that is what's going on. So we actually believe that over the course of the total year, we feel pretty good about where the consumable business is performing. And while we don't want to get into a lot of specifics, we believe that we've got a pretty good beat on some pretty good innovation in the consumable business, that should have a positive impact in 2019 as we go forward.","Nick Alexos","And in terms of Venlo, what we said in Q3, Brandon, it was about a $20 million shortfall. We feel we've covered most of that in Q4, not all of it. And excluding for that effect, our growth rate would have been roughly 100 basis points to 150 basis points less in the quarter, on consumables.","Brandon Couillard","Very good, thank you.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Brandon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you, good morning guys. Can you hear me okay?","Nick Alexos","Yes, Jeff. How are you?","Jeff Johnson","I'm well, thank you. Congratulations on the quarter and the guide. Question for you, Nick. I guess starting with you, just on the margin outlook. Obviously, about 200 basis points at the midpoint this year and obviously we see the end of 2020 and then the 2022 commentary reiterated in the slide deck today.","But kind of help us, is 200 basis points on an annualized basis, kind of the right way to think about the next few years, each of the next few years or should we think about 2019, maybe benefiting from -- Don, as you mentioned the headcount reduction maybe a little ahead of schedule right now, you've obviously got a little bit of rebound effect, that's probably helping this year as well. So just how to think about conceptually, the annualized margin performance, the next couple of few years?","Donald Casey","Yes, I would start Jeff, with the key drivers, obviously, revenue growth. As we said in the past, revenue is very accretive to our operating leverage. We're seeing some of that in 2019 with the targeted gross margin getting up to that, up to that 57% level.","We've targeted operating expense being flat, so that further drives your operating margin improvement. I would say we are -- made good progress on headcount, but we see that continuing through '19 as well. So when you get to be 17%, 18% operating margin going into 2020, you can kind of consider the same trajectory in the years thereafter.","Jeff Johnson","All right, that's helpful, thank you. And Don, I wanted to go back to one point you raised on PrimeScan. You said no annual fees, scan fees, things like that. Does that mean there's going to be no CEREC club fees with that or the total -- or monthly fees completely eliminated?","Donald Casey","Now, we are -- to be specific on that, Jeff, that was in reference to the Omnicam. So we've announced that we're coming up with what we call Omnicam 2.0. So -- and that -- we believe that we have to be able to offer a relatively complete spectrum of products. So it will have everything from PrimeScan fully loaded, so you could -- with software that you can just plug in and mill all the way down to Omnicam 2.0; and PrimeScan, it stays with our traditional revenue model.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. So the 2.0 and not to blabber the point, I just want to understand the 2.0 at the $29,995 you're talking would have no CEREC club fees or anything that -- that's out the door and I can use it as much as I want?","Donald Casey","Yes.","Jeff Johnson","All right, thank you, that's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the questions. Don, can you maybe just talk about how you're viewing the market opportunity for PrimeScan and how big of a product do you think that could be over time? And maybe just tying that kind of back to the guidance, can you give us a sense of what contribution from new products like PrimeScan and SureSmile that you have embedded in that guidance for 4% to 5% internal growth?","Donald Casey","Yes. We'll split that one up, and Nick I'll provide some of the details in terms of what our new products assumptions are. But sufficed it to say, it's not just PrimeScan. We look at the ortho business, we've got some good consumables. So we believe that there is going to be a pretty solid new product number. Now, we're probably not going to give you the exact new product number.","But that being said, on PrimeScan, it's interesting for us, the biggest feature on PrimeScan, it's really easy to use and it's really fast. And we think that is somewhat of a practice game changer. Because I'm not sure you're going to have to have a dentist or somebody with a lot of skill actually using this.","And I'm not sure that in three, four years, we're not going to see that it just becomes part of office practice hygiene, where literally you're going to come in, just like if you went to a GP, they take your blood pressure there, we're going to take additional scan. And finally, we have a product that's going to be able to deliver on the ease to speed and the accuracy that could really make that happen.","The second thing that we did with PrimeScan is we've made an open system and we've worked with people like exocad and others to make sure that we now connect with all labs, and it's an open system. So look, we think PrimeScan as a significant opportunity. And if you look at the past history of this company, when we've had kind of a generational leap in technology in the CAD\/CAM area, it gives us an opportunity to not only expand Chairside.","But finally with this camera, we think that it gives us a real opportunity to begin to change literally how dentists practice in the office. So obviously, we think it's a major opportunity for us and that's one of the reasons we've worked so hard to pull it up and make sure that we've got a great product that's ready to go for Chicago Midwinter and IDS.","We've got a great team over in Benson that's done this and I want to acknowledge the hard work that they've done.","Nick Alexos","And okay. In terms of the revenue, clearly, a significant block is the recovery of the destocking, which is about 2.5% in the Technology & Equipment segment, as Don has mentioned multiple times, we have a good pipeline of new products. We're not going to give specific figures, but that's additive to that number in addition to just base growth in the business.","Donald Casey","Yes.","Nathan Rich","Thanks. I appreciate that. And then, Nick. Just maybe one quick follow-up on EBIT margin. Can you just kind of update us on where we are with pricing in the Technology segment? Do you feel like a lot of the pricing issues that we've seen in the imaging side of the business, do you feel like that's behind you and your pricing, is it a competitive point at this point? And any comment on just kind of maybe what's embedded in the guidance for 2019?","Nick Alexos","Yes, I would say that we made a significant price adjustments in some core markets, principally the US in the back end of 2018 and that full-year pricing is reflected in our guidance for the year. We think our products in imaging are now competitive in their respective markets. So it's appropriately reflected in our guidance.","Nathan Rich","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Kelly of UBS.","Donald Casey","Hi, Kevin. How are you?","Kevin Kelly","Good, thanks. Sorry. I was on mute. Can you guys talk a little bit about PrimeScan, in terms of the process of getting validated by Align and some of the other providers like how does that work? How long does that take? How important is that to the growth of the product and sort of your expectations?","Donald Casey","Yes, Kevin, welcome. We're happy to have you on board.","Kevin Kelly","Thanks.","Donald Casey","Obviously, you have to look at PrimeScan in two different ways in terms of what are we registering, and what aren't we. First is globally and what we -- right now we can launch this product in the major US and European markets.","There are some regulatory hurdles that we've got to get through for rest of the world that will result in PrimeScan kind of being a rolling launch over the course of the year, as we get out to some of our really important markets in Asia.","That's the first thing. In terms of where we are with PrimeScan and Align, probably the -- it's best to ask the Align folks on where that is. We are committed to an open system. And we've been committed to an open system in terms of our mills and furnaces accepting data from other digital impression devices. So, we think that's important.","And right now, we believe that Omni is an important source of digital impression material for the Align team. So that's -- right now, we don't have a specific answer on that. We're working on it, but we've got a good relationship with those guys. Omni has been in a good partnership for both of us, so we'll see as we go forward.","Kevin Kelly","That's really helpful. And could you talk a little bit about SureSmile? What is the -- is this a product that you envision being mostly used by orthos or is there an opportunity in the GP market or how are you segregating that? Is it a different pitch to either or can you just talk a little bit about the opportunity, so we can -- I can sort of understand how it fits competitively in the marketplace.","Donald Casey","Yes, Kevin, that's one of those where we, you asked two questions. We just say, yes. Look, we think it's a significant opportunity in ortho and let's talk about that. We believe that we have a very comprehensive treatment protocol -- treatment guide protocol that does complete root to crown work. We also for our ortho offering do what's called a hybrid treatment in some cases where clear aligners isn't enough to get the job done, so that involves putting traditional brackets and bands on for a short period of time and then finishing with clear aligners but the aggregate of a hybrid treatment is actually significantly shorter than what a traditional brackets and band treatment is. So that we believe that's first our clear aligner offering, our treatment protocol and the hybrid offering makes us very competitive in the ortho space.","We also believe that there is a pretty significant opportunity GPs. Again, we will stack our treatment guidelines up with anybody and ease of use of our system. We think that we've got a terrific set of software programs that right now that by the way, when coupled with PrimeScan, and this is an example of how we are trying to get different parts of Dentsply Sirona to work together. I mean, we literally launched our GP software. It's ready to go with PrimeScan right over the back. We think we've got a great opportunity for GPs where they're getting root to crown treatment planning, they're getting a great clear aligner, and we think it's going to work seamlessly with what we think is the best prime -- with PrimeScan, we think the best digital impression piece of equipment on the market.","Kevin Kelly","That's great, guys. Thanks so much for help and congrats on the quarter.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Kevin.","Nick Alexos","Thank you.","Operator","And next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks, guys. Nick, maybe to start off, can you just talk to what gives you confidence that we won't see any more destocking? Obviously it's been a rocky kind of two years. So what gives you the confidence going forward that we really are through to the tail end of it?","Nick Alexos","Thanks, Tyco. Well, first and foremost, we have a really good dialog and direct communication with our dealer partners to track their retail sales and their inventory. Second, it's been, first and foremost priority throughout the year, net we got to about $100 million destocking for the year and net purchasing level where we can have retail sales be directly correlated with our wholesale shipments. It's a priority to keep it that way. I hope to never talk about destocking after 2019. And that just have our sales speak to the market demand directly. So we have a high degree of confidence that this will be an issue that will be put behind us.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, Don, on PrimeScan. I appreciate all the color. Can you maybe just talk to your discussions with DSOs and then also dental labs? How you're progressing with both those constituencies?","Donald Casey","Yes, thanks, Tycho. First I'll start with the labs. We went out and wanted to make sure that we can seamlessly integrate our -- moving our digital impression stuff right to any lab and use any lab system and we've made the necessary arrangement with the software providers. Prior to this, it was a little bit cumbersome in some cases to move our data over to labs and right now we're totally open. We feel that any -- literally any lab in the country can accept data of PrimeScan right off the back. So we're very, very excited about that and we've had those conversations, people forget sometimes that we actually have a lab group. So -- and we've been working through our dealer partners as well. So that's the first thing, and then, look, we ultimately believe that PrimeScan, you actually saw it, I know, you saw it when you were in Chicago, we think it's a pretty, pretty strong product and we're, as you can tell, when we were there, we're pretty excited about how competitive it is.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just lastly for Nick, the swapping of assets between T&E and Consumables, does this change the segment growth rates at all as we think about it going forward or is it a wash?","Nick Alexos","I would say it's not material and -- actually there won't be a material impact, and obviously, you'll see the restated numbers after our Q1 results.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, this is Jonathan Young [ph] on for Steve. Just in relation to the company's portfolio shaping initiatives, I know you guys have the $70 million coming up in 2018. But as we think about 2019, 2020 moving forward, I mean, should we assume a similar type of level of divestments that should be happening move forward or what's the kind of magnitude that you guys are thinking about in relation to that?","Donald Casey","Yes. Thanks, John. Yes, look, the size of these kind of portfolio shaping activities, you can see, they're not significant. I mean we're not saying we're going to move one of the traditional dental pieces of business or Wellspect. So I think we've got probably another couple of the size that we've been doing. I don't think you should look to see a dramatic acceleration of that, look, if we finish this whole thing out at about, we posted $70 million. There maybe one or two more, we think it'll stay under $100 million going forward. So don't expect huge changes in 2020, 2021","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then just on PrimeScan, I think when we were at the Chicago show, you were targeting more for new users. I guess what's been the commentary from new users versus existing users and when do you plan on providing an upgrade path for current Omnicam users? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Well, first, right now, the reaction has been really, really positive, both from perspective new users as well as current users. The current users have to make a decision, because we're not offering an upgrade program right now. We may come back in the third or fourth quarter and offer that. Some of that's going to be contingent on how much product we have available, we feel we've got a really good stock, we got really good production plan. But I got to tell you, right now, given that the amount of PrimeScan is somewhat limited, we don't feel that we want to be in a position of being aggressive right out of the gate on offering an upgrade program.","So in our mind, we've always said what the best way for us to improve our penetration in the really important Chairside business, is to come up with great products, we feel we're doing that. The emphasis that we have right now and we've been working with our dealer partners, let's sell this to new users. And we're pretty excited that this product changes the ability for us to have a totally new conversation with those users.","So look, we are optimistic that we will be able to see improvements over time in our ability to penetrate new users, point one. Point two is, we may come back with a upgrade program, but that's not a guarantee this year. So if current CEREC users actually wanted to get the -- want to get the upgrade, they're going to probably have to participate at full price right now.","I will say, obviously, we talk to our KOLs and we talk -- we tested this product quite extensively before we launched it. And we got a really good reaction from the CEREC doctors. And there's been a lot of them saying just, this is a game changer for me, I want the product now, and they all have been willing to pay for that. So --","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Thanks, good morning. I'll start with implants. And I think, Don, you mentioned that recently turned positive. It's big for you guys considering the size of the business. So can you talk a little bit more about the division and can we expect that business to creep closer to market growth in '19? And would you agree that implant market growth is in that sort of 4% to 5% neighborhood? And then I've got a follow-up.","Donald Casey","Yes. First Jon, great on the follow-up. Yes, we do think the implant business is growing 4% to 5%; point one. Point two is, look, we're happy that we're starting to make progress on the implant business and showing year-on-year growth is a first step. In 2019, I'm not sure that we're going to be performing exactly at market, but we just -- we think that the steps in our implant business have been, look, let's get a new leadership team in place. We've done that, we took one of our best leaders out of our historically well-performing rest-of-business and moved that there. We believe that we have a lot of consolidation opportunities in terms of -- right now we have multiple marketing programs and multiple R&D that we're in the process of combining and getting that focused on one thing. We believe that, when you look at the combined assets of all the R&D that we do in implants, we could do much better job of focusing on creating a little bit more breakthrough innovation there.","We have done a better job commercially, which is why we actually saw growth on implants in the critical US market. But over time, look, we think that we ought to be very competitive in the implant business. Whether that happens in '19 or '20, we're committed to growing the business. And one of the important steps in this SFE program that we talked about, in our Sales Force Effectiveness program is, we're now looking at how do we create leads and how do we create support for the implant business with all the other units that we have in and out of dentist offices every day.","And we do believe, we have an opportunity to take advantage of the breadth and depth of Dentsply Sirona in creating lead generation and other things. So we're happy that we're starting to see some better performance on implants. I think we have a long way to go, but we have a pretty darn good portfolio and I believe our commercial engine over time is going to be helpful to that. And I think you had a follow-up.","Jon Block","I did. Thanks for that color. The follow-up, just sort of high-level pivoting to demand creation. You guys have mentioned that's a big initiative for the Company. And so, Don, how is that progressing and PrimeScan is your first big new product post that plan. So, maybe you can talk to us on how you're approaching the market with the demand creation initiative with PrimeScan versus what was the prior approach? Thanks guys.","Donald Casey","Well, there's two things, Jon. I mean, I would tell you, let's take a big step back. If you go back a year ago, we didn't have a CAD\/CAM sales force. And one of the things that Nick and I did when we came in is [indiscernible] and said hey, I think John and Patterson do a great job, but we would like to have some clinical experts that are out to hit hot leads very, very quickly. So we've actually gone out and completed a unit. We're very, very happy with how that unit is performing. And I think our dealers would say it's been a positive addition to the demand creation; that's the first thing. The second thing, if you look at how we're launching PrimeScan, PrimeScan is a Dentsply Sirona launch, it's not a CAD\/CAM launch.","And by that I mean, literally at our -- we had over 1,000 sales people at our National Meeting down in Atlanta, about three weeks ago. And literally every single rep in Dentsply Sirona was taught how to use PrimeScan. Every single rep in Dentsply Sirona has now been given to every dentist they walk out into. Here's some information on PrimeScan, every single one of them is now open. Here is five questions you can ask about the dentist who does not have a digital impression piece of equipment work is not a Chairside. So that we can create leads for our PrimeScan. And by the way, they are now compensated if there are leads generated for Endo or PrimeScan or other things, they're compensated for it and they're compensated well.","So that is a pretty dramatic change. The second really big demand creation activity that we put in. And Jon, we love to get you down to Charlotte where we are sitting right now above our Academy. We've spent a lot of time, talent, and treasure, on continuing education. We believe when we launch these products and we're trying to change digital workflow, it's really important for us to back that up with a lot of clinical education. So whether it's things like our Academy, expanding our clinical education capacity, we spent a lot of time on this. So we are, again, it's not going to be overnight, but we believe we are taking significant steps and that will enable us to enhance the ability to take great innovations like PrimeScan and SureSmile and other things and launch it on the DS platform as opposed to on a small silo.","Jon Block","Got it. Helpful color. Thanks, Don.","Donald Casey","All right, thanks, Jon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. Can you give us an update on your supply chain integration initiatives. And what does this really mean for the role of third-party distribution for you and how are your relationships progressing there? And can you just remind us of your overall commitment to third-party distribution? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Thanks, Erin. First, we continue to be committed to our dealer partners and we think they do a great job. I will start with the fact that, our dealer partners do a lot of different things, which I think are sometimes under-appreciated. I mean, they go out and do a lot of the service work, we've got a 100,000 plus SKUs and they provide tremendous logistics support, and they are a very valued partner from a demand creation perspective in a lot of different areas. So we remain committed to the dealer partners and we continue to work well with them. As a matter of fact, I think we're probably working better with them today, than we were a year ago.","In terms of what our overall supply chain initiative. Erin, even if the business pretty well. I mean, we had actually close to 12 supply chains. We had 11 SBUs each unit running their own manufacturing and we've had somewhat of a little bit of a corporate infrastructure that would help to talking about things like distribution, when we did a consolidated initiatives like Lancaster or Venlo. Basically what Dan Key and Dan comes with us -- comes to us with 30 years and has done multiple supply chain integrations within healthcare on a global basis. So he's been a tremendous addition to our Group, and he is already bringing in talent in the distribution and demand planning areas, that are going to bring a discipline for Dentsply Sirona as opposed to 11 individual SBUs.","So what that immediately does on us is like we start thinking about the 40-plus manufacturing facilities, the 80-plus distribution facilities as a network. And once you begin looking at things as a network, you can begin to understand where you have capacity, where we need to shed capacity and other things. So we feel that there are significant opportunity, I'll tell you right off the bat in procurement, when we start acting as an integrated supply chain. But we think that we can significantly improve our distribution footprint and take advantage of some synergies there. And yes, it's kind of early days for the supply chain leadership team and going out and evaluating the manufacturing. But again, we think there's opportunities when you move things from individual SBUs to a network.","And as we put together 2019, there were some obvious things that we think that we're going to be able to take advantage of this year.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then on PrimeScan, which is something that you were able to expedite through the development pipeline, given the R&D optimization initiatives that you have in place, and what are some of the other new product areas that you're focused on at IDS, is it around implants or other areas I assume, we should see more new launches at the show?","Donald Casey","Yes, you will. In both booths, Erin, if you're coming over. But, PrimeScan, look, when you take a big step back and look at what we're trying to accomplish with Dentsply Sirona, in our mind is, we want to bring solutions to dentists. And one of the best ways we can do that is really pushing digital dentistry, whether that's in Chairside or really moving digital to a different place than it is today, so that you can do things like SureSmile, you can do things in my opinion like surgical guides and implants.","So, we said that, that was an area that -- we felt that there was technology in the pipeline that if we gave them the resources that you could see an acceleration. And we believe it's pivotal to begin to show progress in some of the major SBUs. And that was the first one we could get out the shoot. So additional resources enable that one to be pulled forward, and obviously, we're happy with the result.","But we think that there is multiple examples across the portfolio where we think we've had some things in -- on the shelf that we maybe be able to accelerate and really begin to push that are going to make a -- we say it's got to move the needle for the enterprise. And if we go from 100 projects down to 40, and really focus on those 40, we think you're going to see those initiatives happen a lot faster. In IDS, without giving away, obviously, PrimeScan is going to be one of the stars of the show. But we have SureSmile there, we've Acuris which is a new fastener system in our implant business, as well as Azento. So we're excited about some of the stuff we're doing in implants. We have some good stuff coming in the Consumables, which we haven't announced yet and we remain excited about that. And we've got a good Endo product, virtual anatomy, that we will be featuring for the first time in that show.","So we've got lots of news. The big difference for us at IDS is, we're going to be focused on kind of these big things to make sure that every dentist that walks out of IDS knows that these are kind of the priorities. But, if you come over to -- again, we have a very significant presence at IDS. We do have some kind of enhancements to products that we think might be attractive to dentists as well, and that's one of the reasons we have such a big presence there. But we are very optimistic that we're going to have a good show at IDS. And obviously, we're looking forward to head to Cologne in about a week. So\u2026","Erin Wright","That's great, thank you.","Donald Casey","Thank you, Erin. John, what you've got?","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Thanks very much. Don, I know you guys have been primarily internally focused. But if you step back and sort of think about the broader global dental market, can you give us what your sense is? Is it getting better, getting worse? Where do you see the biggest growth opportunities over the next few years?","Donald Casey","John, it's an interesting question. Because there's obviously been some conflicting signals sent out. You look, our outside US growth was really, really good in the fourth quarter and we see no -- we don't see anything in the horizon that's really going to slow that down. If you look at for us, some of our Latin American, we're seeing some good progress in Asia Pacific, particularly in China. So we continue to be optimistic about that.","We had a question a little bit earlier around implants. And if you look at how the implant business is growing, we continue to see progress in that. I mean, we have a lot of people that are aging. I mean there's going to be 25 million 80-year olds by 2025. And I think that speaks well to the opportunities we have there. I think, if you look at the underlying growth of what we thought of retail of the Technology & Equipment in the fourth quarter, we thought that was pretty strong.","And again, when you start seeing, in our case, we'll have PrimeScan and we'll have Omni 2. We feel very, very good that, those kind of step changes innovation. And by the way, we know there's going to be a lot of competition with IDS in the digital impression. We think that bodes well for the overall category. Because I think it is -- you are bringing technology that's going to improve workflow. And with improved workflow, I think you're going to see enhanced revenues for the dentists.","So we remain optimistic about it. Again our -- when we put the guidance out in November about what we thought, our long-term growth aspirations of 3% to 4% on the revenue side, we felt pretty good about that. And I think if you -- people set their [indiscernible] in technology and equipment space going to continue growing that way. Boy, if you look at clear aligners and you look at implants, which is -- that's where we look at those businesses. Yes, we continue to see very, very positive trends in that space.","John Kreger","Excellent. Thank you. I just -- one other one if you could clarify. I know you're very focused on sort of reorienting and consolidating the sales organization. Can you just tell us where does that stand, and how much more do you have to do in '19 to be done? Thanks.","Donald Casey","Yes. John. You almost want to look at that as regionally phasing. So US, we're now operating in the new model. So we -- look, we've now put everybody into place, we put the systems into place, we've done all the segmenting work, we've changed our communication, we changed our measuring target, and everybody has learned the new CRM system. That being said, kind of significant sales force changes. You have to let that marinate for three months before you really begin to measure and again of course correct six months before you really in my opinion, see people really positively impacting the business.","But we also believe the SFE program is not just going to be a US program. We believe we have significant opportunities in Canada, in Europe, with a particular focus on Germany; Japan and China that we're rolling this program out, and that will be over the course of '19. But right now, in the US, we are operating under the new model and we'll report on that as what we see. But coming out of February, we felt good.","John Kreger","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Sweeney.","John Sweeney","Thanks very much, Kevin. And thank you everybody for joining us today. We looking -- we are very much looking forward to seeing many of you at the IDS, it's about 10 years -- sorry, 10 days. We're very encouraged by the execution of our restructuring initiatives, we're very happy with the innovation that we have with PrimeScan. And we look forward to showing you many of the other things that we have at the show. Thank you, everybody, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, so this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"6900":["DENTSPLY International (NASDAQ:XRAY) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 29, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Derek W.

And welcome to the DENTSPLY International Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Derek W. Leckow","Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY's third quarter 2013 results. I'm here today with Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and CFO; and Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President and COO. I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued this morning. A copy of the release and a set of slides to accompany this call are available for download on our website, www.dentsply.com under the financial information Quarterly Results tab. I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's press release also pertain to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings.","The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. As you can see in the release, our results quarter include a few non-recurring items and other non-GAAP adjustments. Our comments on this call will focus on results, excluding certain adjustments that provide operational insight, excluding these items. These items are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You will note that our earnings guidance is also presented on adjusted basis. A recording of this call and its entirety will be available on our website. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret W. Wise","Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thanks again for joining us on our call this morning. I had a few overview comments on both the market conditions and then our overall results, and then I'll turn the call over to Jim and Chris for a more in-depth discussion of the results.","First on the market. We continue to see the overall market is relatively stable versus what we saw late last year and then also early in 2013. The U.S. continues to be a growth market. Europe is flat at best as we've seen for some time now. And the Rest of World varies with the developing regions growing nicely and the developed regions in a low growth stage. So overall, market conditions are generally consistent with what we've reported on our second quarter call.","With respect to our results, we reported sales growth of 3.4%, x precious metals this quarter. Internal growth and at constant currency growth were both 2.7% and that is the same that we've reported for Q2. And currency in the third quarter was slightly positive, up 70 basis points. Our internal growth was strongest in the U.S. and Rest of World. U.S. was up 4.3% and Rest of World was up 6%. And growth continued to be slow in Europe where we grew 0.3% in the quarter.","In the U.S. several of our new product launches this year are doing quite well, and we have some interesting projects that will to the market in the next couple of quarters. Jim is going to comment further on this in his remarks. In Europe, this quarter, marks the 15th straight quarter of positive internal growth for us in the region, which is quite remarkable given the economic climate there. Like the U.S., we're getting some help from our new products but essentially no help from economic conditions. And although there's -- we filed the recent news of slightly improved economic conditions in Europe, I'd remind you that dentistry is typically a trailing indicator. So we're not expecting an immediate reaction our markets, but rather dentistry would likely respond in a couple of quarters. Our Rest of World sales, again, were up 4.6% this quarter, which is a nice sequential improvement. Overall, we saw high single-digit growth in the emerging economies and low single-digit growth in overall in the developed regions that we have in that category.","From a product category perspective, all 4 of our principal product category groups grew in the quarter with the strongest growth rates in medical and the dental specialties.","With respect to our adjusted earnings, on a 3.4% topline growth, we reported 7.2% operating income growth, reflecting a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margins. On prior calls, we've talked about our emphasis on operating margin expansion this year, both from a gross margin perspective but also from the expense line. We feel like we're making pretty good progress in both these areas and we're pleased that we're now reporting operating margin expansion on a year-to-date basis as well.","Overall, adjusted EPS improved 11.8% in the quarter, that's over 3x the rate of top line growth, bringing our year-to-date EPS growth to 6.1%.","Now looking ahead, we're confirming our guidance for the full year at adjusted EPS of $2.33 to $2.38 per share. This, again, is on an adjusted base. A couple of factors that we're watching closely, are dealer channel inventories and new product introductions. On the former, last year, you may recall, we had 2 price increases: October 1, and then again, on January 1 of this year. And due to these dynamics, our dealers held inventories high, going into the end of last year and on our call for Q4 last year, we commented that boost our total sales in the fourth quarter by what we viewed is probably 1%. This year, we're not planning any year price increase, so we expect the dealers will reduce inventories in the fourth quarter following the October 1 price increase this year that we just implemented. So this year, we've probably will see a liquidating dealer inventory channel versus the build that we saw on our fourth quarter last year.","The second item of importance, I think, is new products. We have a pretty good slate of innovation coming to the market this year, including in the fourth quarter. But that should be a positive element and partially offset the dealer inventory reduction that I just mentioned. Of course, we'll update you on this when we report our full year results in February. And at the same time, we'll provide guidance for 2014. But I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim. He's got a few comments on the implant integration and also the new product portfolio. Jim?","James G. Mosch","Thank you, Bret. I'd first like to review our implant business. In Q3, our global implants sales were flat on a constant-currency basis. U.S. was up mid-single digits, Europe was negative, and the Rest of World showed sequential improvement, up mid-single digits. As discussed in our second quarter call, we went live with the consolidated DENTSPLY Friadent and Astra Tech German organizations in Q1 of this year. To date, good process has been made on training, customer transition, as well as consolidation of operating systems, which are now complete. Based on trends, we observed other major markets following integration. We are now at a point where the organization is returning to a normal level of competency and effectiveness, and we expect to return to growth in this important market in 2014.","From a marketing perspective, in October, DENTSPLY implants Germany held an implant congress in which 400 plus clinicians attended. We're very pleased with the response and results and in particular, the strong interest in our technology-base. It's important to note that we have continued our integration efforts with the implant business as we worked to realize identified synergies. Consistent with our integration plan, we took a small restructuring charge in Q3, and we'll take a second charge in Q4 as part of our ongoing efforts to improve operating performance of the implant business.","Turning to new products. 2013 has been a good year for launching new innovative brands. Thus far, this year, we have launched a new composite system, TPH Spectra, 2 new fluoride varnish brands, NUPRO varnish and Durashield CV and a new endodontics system ProTaper NEXT, as well as numerous other innovations discussed on previous calls this year. In addition, we have recently launched several additional new products that we believe would be very impactful to the market and will be received well by our customers.","First in our restorative segment, we have a significant launch, Aquasil Ultra Cordless, this is a novel one-step system for taking impressions in crown or bridge applications, which in most cases, eliminates the need for the use of a retraction cord. Packing the retraction cord is a time-consuming process for the clinician and can be uncomfortable for the patient. Our new system consists of a unique Aquasil-based tissue management and pressure material and a pneumatic delivery device. The device expresses the material through a small cannula that is inserted between the tooth and in gingiva, making the procedure simpler and more patient friendly and eliminates the need for a retraction cord. Aquasil Ultra Cordless reduces the time for a cord placement and impression taking procedure by up to 70%. Impression taking is a large part of the market and we expect this new innovative technique to have a meaningful impact.","In our preventive segment, we have a number of new product launches. I will highlight 2: The Cavitron Prophy Jet is an updated air polishing unit with tap-on technology that is designed to improve ergonomics by reducing foot pedal usage and adding a prophy mode that autocycles between air polishing and rinse, thereby improving the prophy procedure. Second is the Midwest Automate, a single station for providing automated and consistent maintenance for various hand pieces using in the dental arbitrary [ph]. The automated maintenance station will aid in improving the useful life of dental hand pieces. And although it is not new for the market, it's a new category for the Midwest portfolio, which is one of leading hand piece brands in the market.","Within our implant group, we launched Simplant 16, a new updated version of the Simplant implant training software with several new features, including the integration of Atlantis WebOrder, customized departments for immediate restoration, and iPad viewer for sharing case planning information with patients. We are one of the leaders in the market in implant planning and customized digital solutions, and this product leverages our market position in brands through an integrated approach.","Finally, within our endodontics group, we have launched Proglider, a new viable taper rotary glidepath file that can create a glidepath in most cases with only one instrument, compared to 2 to 3 instruments, for traditional technology providing simplicity and speed for endospecialist and general practitioners.","Overall, 2013 has been a good year for DENTSPLY in regards to new product development and product launches, which is a key growth for overall performance.","I will now turn the call over to Chris for the financial overview.","Christopher T. Clark","Thank you, Jim, good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on our third quarter results by reviewing key elements of our income statement, and also provide some additional color on our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter.","Our sales growth, excluding precious metals of 3.4%, and our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% for the period reflects some volume improvements in both our U.S. and Rest of World geographic regions, increased leverage in our operating model, and also the impact of synergy benefits. Our growth was largely organic with 2.7% internal growth and currency translation impact of a positive 70 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter.","Gross profit, on an adjusted basis in the third quarter, was 56.6% of sales excluding precious metals, which was down 30 basis points from the prior year comparison of 56.9%. This was entirely due to the headwinds in the medical device excise tax in the United States and the gross profit rate on an adjusted basis would have been up slightly compared to prior year without this impact.","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were $259 million in the quarter were 38.7% of sales excluding precious metals. That's sort of 100-basis-point improvement from last year's 39.7% SG&A rate. On a year-to-date basis, [indiscernible] [indiscernible] are down 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals. And we're pleased with the improved leverage and synergies across our businesses, including the impact of our cost saving efforts in integration activities.","Operating margin for the quarter improved 60 basis points to 17.9% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, compared to 17.3% in the third quarter last year, reflecting the SG&A and the gross margin impacts that I just described. On a year-to-date basis, operating margin has improved 20 basis points compared to prior year. We're pleased to be delivering operating margin improvement despite the continued muted market conditions in a number of countries. Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 14.0%, while our operating tax rate was 22.1%, which is consistent with our expectations for the year.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, on an as-reported basis in the third quarter, was $79.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $53.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. These results include a number of items that we've listed in the schedules in the release. On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew 12% to $82.2 million or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $74.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012.","Moving onto cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $126 million, up 31% from $96 million in last year's third quarter. This brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $258 million or 28% increase from prior year-to-date despite some investments in working capital. Our cash flow performance in the quarter allowed us to reduce debt by an additional $108 million. And our net debt-to-capital ratio now stands at 35.8%, a significant improvement from the 48.2% net-debt-to-cap ratio immediately following the Astra Tech acquisition in September 2011.","Inventory now stands at 118 days, which is up 7 days compared to September 2012, and up 2 days from the end of June. As we discussed on this call last quarter, we strategically increased inventory in a few businesses as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operating changes. We expect inventory may continue to increase slightly for another quarter or so to support these efforts before returning to more normal levels as we move through 2014 and 2015. Accounts receivable days were 64 days at the end of September. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the quarter, bringing year-to-date level to $74 million, and we continue to believe our capital spending will be in the $100 million range for the year.","Depreciation in the quarter was $20 million, while amortization was $11 million.","Looking at capital deployment. Our approach continues to be focused on balance. As we look to support internal investments, return cash to shareholders, share repurchases and dividends, strengthen the company through acquisitions and also continue gradual debt reduction. Year-to-date, DENTSPLY Inc. returned almost $100 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares during the first 9 months in an average cost of $41.89 per share, but still have approximately 14 million shares available for repurchase based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock.","Finally, as Bret stated, our 2013 earnings per share guidance remains $2.33 and $2.38 on an adjusted basis reflecting our assessment of continued above market performance but also the impact of continued high dealer inventories and ongoing soft market conditions in Europe. That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support and we've now be glad to answer any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bret, I wonder if you can just start on the dental implant side of the of the business? Wondering, it sounds like some declines there again this quarter. Maybe you could flush out -- and that's common in Europe, obviously. I'm wondering if you could flush out the European market especially what you're seeing in Germany now that the sales force integration is complete there. And Jim, would like to hear maybe what gives you the confidence that dental implant growth turns positive again in 2014 as you talked about in your prepared remarks.","Bret W. Wise","Jim, why don't Jim Mosch take all that? You're kind of prepared than I am.","James G. Mosch","Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. I think, obviously, we've continued to see challenges in the European market overall. From the standpoint, the issues in Southern Europe may be while improving slightly, are still negative. And I think we've just seen a general slowness in Europe overall so we've not seen a real change in the European implant market. All indications are that the German implant market is negative. And we think that this to some degree is undermining some of our recovery and our growth. But from the standpoint of our German implant business, the situation that we've seen in the major markets where we've gone through integration, there is this 6- to 9-month period as you go through really -- you're now educating 2 salesforces on each other's implant systems. You have customer transition getting to know new customers, building relationships, familiarity with operating systems. It was just a series of general things that you go through in a transition process. And obviously, we like that to be quicker, but we're also realistic about how much time that takes. And certainly the magnitude in our larger markets. I can say we experienced similar trend in the U.S. market when we went live there. My confidence is that we're really seeing those operating transition issues really come to a close. We held the implant conference in Germany, which was very well attended. We had our organization present as well and we just saw a lot of positive come out of that. So we really see our organization focusing more on customers and the business. We really expect that, that improvement will take through the fourth quarter. And next year, we have certainly have higher expectations.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And just maybe a follow-up on that, Jim. It sounds like U.S. was up mid-single digits, Rest of World up mid-single digits on the implant side. Europe down as you said. Was that -- would that have been down mid-single digits? And maybe sequentially if you could compare last quarter to this quarter? Was it better or worse? And then my only other question would be, in Germany, especially, on the dental implant side, how much of it do you think at this point is macro versus the generics and in clones and those kind of products that are coming into the markets? I guess I'm still trying to figure out Europe, if Europe for the premium guys [ph] can get back to growth anytime soon given the generics in the clones or if that market for the premium players like yourself is just going to stay negative for some time to come?","James G. Mosch","Well, I think the issues with the generics and the clones. I think we have to recognize that when you look at the overall size revenue of the implant market, particularly the premium implant market, that's really still the dominant portion of that marketplace. There's no question that the value segment is getting a lot of play right now. This is an area that we continue to watch very closely. And quite frankly, assess, work to assess what impact it is having. But I would say that I think the trends are really going to be predominantly driven by the growth in those markets and by the premium players. And I think we saw some positive signs in Q2, overall. Although I think what causes you to pause is that Q1 was very negative. So as we go into this third quarter, I think it will be very interesting to see, as all the implant companies report, to get a better understanding as to do we actually have a positive trend up? Or is it really kind of continuing? The reality is, through the first half of the year, the market is still negative. So I think this quarter, will be kind of an important indicator to give us an idea of how that market is trending.","Bret W. Wise","Yes. The other thing I'd add to that, Jeff, is just qualitatively, what we see today is that in an economy that's growing, the premium implant group does pretty well. We see that in the U.S., we see it in a lot of the Rest of World markets and in an economy that's still flat on its back, or not growing [ph], or maybe only growing slightly, it's a tougher challenge because there's no economic expansion, no discretionary income growth, et cetera.","Operator","And so we'll go to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Bret, could you just elaborate on kind of what we saw in the U.S. in the period? Was there any pre-buying ahead of the price increase this year and can you give us a sense of the magnitude of that price hike?","Bret W. Wise","Sure. The pre-buy -- we do have -- an October 1 price increase every year and the products that go through distribution and dealers predictably buy ahead of that price increase to protect their margins as they then liquidate that inventory. I'd say the activity we saw this year ahead of the price increase was comparable to what we've seen in prior years. No major change there. So the change that we called out this morning was that last year, because we had yet another price increase coming January 1, dealers kept their inventories higher, even grew their inventories in the fourth quarter where this year, we think they'll follow the more natural progression of liquidating inventories. Price increases, in total, were comparable to what we've seen in the past. Maybe 1.5%, 2%.","Christopher T. Clark","Pretty much in the traditional range, 1.5% to 2%, Brandon.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, Chris, or, Bret, could you just elaborate kind of on where we are from a capital deployment perspective? And what's your priorities kind of are moving forward here? And perhaps, give us an update on how you view the acquisition pipeline.","Bret W. Wise","Sure. As we said since the acquisition, we were very much in a debt reduction mode. We've kind of worked our debt to cap down from kind of 50%-ish to maybe 35%-ish year over the last 2 years and the leverage ratio has come down comparably. Such that both are very close now or maybe even in our normal ranges. So as Chris mentioned on the call, and Chris may have something to add to this, our capital deployment now is going to be we think a more balanced approach spread between some still some debt reduction probably, particularly the extent we have excess cash flow and you saw that this quarter we brought that down by over $100 million. Balance with share repurchases, we bought 100 -- 1.7 million shares this year, and then also acquisitions. We don't have anything to report today on acquisitions, but we view ourselves in a fragmented industry and we're a traditional consolidator and we expect to continue to participate in that.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jonathan Beake with Citi.","Jonathan A. Beake - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2. Firstly, just if you give us a quick update on the ortho business where you are in terms of market share and where you're hoping to get there. And second, on the implant business just a follow-up to the earlier question. We've seen some of your European competitors or pay for this one sort of ramp up there interest in pursuing a sort of jewel brand strategy. I wondered, I know you guys are already half there, and already have the Phase III DIO, but whether there's any interest in further increasing your exposure to the discount segment?","James G. Mosch","Thanks very much. In regards to the ortho business, that business has continued to improve. Obviously, we were very much a recovery mode last year as we exited the market and then came back into the market. Our supplier has done a good job of recovering from a volume perspective. And I believe when we came back into the market, we did see a sizable recovery of customers that occurred immediately. You know those customers that we have strong relationships, we're able to maintain relationships and business through the supply outage. As we've gotten into the market place, obviously, our competitors have been very aggressive. And we've been fighting to recover that next set of customers. We think we've made good progress. We look at it kind of as a third, a third, a third. We recovered probably a third immediately. We continue to fight for the second and third. And obviously, we've got more that we don't[ph] have to go after. We've seen good growth in U.S. As we look at the Rest of World, there is some element of baseline issue in that we are depending on how we rolled out the recovery. We had a lot of stock up with our customers and obviously, some of our dealers in the prior year. So now we're kind of running up against that comparison. But regardless, we are happy with the recovery that we've seen in that business. And we think we could make good progress across several initiatives.","Christopher T. Clark","I might add to that, that I do think the market conditions in ortho remain incredibly competitive. I mean, probably as competitive as we've ever seen as the competition that took our customers. So obviously, when we couldn't supply them, we're doing everything we can obviously, to retain those customers as we're now back in the market. So I think we've categorized this thing as a street fight, and I think that, that's very much where we are at this stage.","Bret W. Wise","Jonathan, I'll take the value implant question. With respect to value implant and dual branding, I'd say DENTSPLY is probably the king of dual branding in the dental markets. Although and usually in these high-end businesses or the very technique-sensitive businesses, if you're going to do a brand, you need to do it through a separate channel. And so we're watching very closely what's being done in this market and we have a few concerns about what the profitability of some of these companies are. We've seen a few come up for sale and they weren't real positive. So the question is, can you do a brand, a value impact without the customer support that the premium [indiscernible] companies offer? And I would say our customers are increasingly demanding on new innovation and customer support, including a direct salesforce, including the symposiums, opinion leaders, support, et cetera. So there are still some questions about that business model. Now about 3 years ago at this time, we made an investment in our value implant company in South Korea, so we're participating in the market through that investment. Today, it's not entirely clear how the market's going to shake out, but we're prepared to participate depending upon what the ending dynamics of this -- of the markets are value versus premium. And typically, those will bifurcate in dental markets and we've seen that in other dental markets around the world.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Erin Wilson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you give us an update on the impact of the exclusion of the gray market distributor in Rest of the World? And have you been able to recover some of those sales?","James G. Mosch","Yes, absolutely. As mentioned in our last call, we identified some gray market activity in our kind of Central, Eastern Europe, Middle East to Africa area. We did take some action, and obviously, that did have an impact on our Rest of World sales, primarily due to that market. We've engaged in a very diligent process as it relates to how we evaluate new distributors. We put that process in place. It is rigorous. I think it really helps us to identify the quality capabilities over those dealers and also, as well as business practices. And so we've continued to add dealers and we saw a nice improvement in that area in the third quarter. Those new dealer additions have had an impact. I think they've added quality to our business. And we feel that, that business is recovering to a more normal conditions.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And can you speak to the underlying demand trends in the U.S. from a volume perspective? I know you kind of touched on this earlier, but also, just given the changes in the dealer inventory, how should we think about kind of the quarterly progression of our organic growth trends?","Christopher T. Clark","Erin it's Chris. Relative to volume, I think that as we look at look forwards in terms of internal growth in the U.S., there is some volume in that based on our analysis. And I think that's encouraging, certainly from our perspective. As Bret mentioned, in terms of inventories, inventories again, with the price increase October 1, so dealers bought in an advanced to that. Pretty typical in terms of levels, I would say. And I think that the factor that we've really got as we look to Q4, is that we're going against the base period where not only did they buy in advance in Q4 last year, but they kept inventories high, and in some cases, added to that in advance of the January 1st price increase, which again, based on really kind of the unfavorable comparison we're going to be running up against. So we're -- we've got a period come up here in Q4 that we're going to -- we anticipate dealer inventories in U.S. to liquidate. And going up against the period in the prior year, where they were high and actually increased.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just one quick one, and broadly speaking here from a capital deployment standpoint, if you are truly in a more of an acquisition mode 5 years down the road, what businesses really make sense for you? What do you expect as far as businesses or geographies? Do you expect to emphasize or deemphasize going forward?","Bret W. Wise","Erin this is a Bret. That's a really tough question, particularly looking that far out because there's -- we're such a fragmented industry, and sometimes acquisitions are opportunistic. Meaning, you need a willing seller in order to transact. But I'd say that generally speaking, we're looking for technologies first. Meaning, some technology that would supplement our exiting portfolio in one of our 6 verticals. And now 7 verticals, including the medical group that we have. Second of all, we'd be looking for strong brands in markets where we have somewhat weak presence. And third, we'd be looking for distribution or increasing our channel activity. And in priority, it's probably in that order. But it's hard to predict which of the 7 verticals that would be transacting in over the next 5 years. It will be a little bit somewhat opportunistic in that regard.","Operator","The next question from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just looking at SG&A and trying to get a better sense on how should we be thinking about the spending going forward. Bret you mentioned operating margin expansion being a big focus. And you guys clearly have done a nice job managing spend this year even if sales have started to come back. I'm just wondering if maybe you could walk a little bit more to the pushes and pulls on the SG&A line as we move forward. Specifically, I guess, trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about synergies from Astra Tech against you mentioned new product launches. Any expenses that we should be considering as we enter into the new product launch cycle?","Christopher T. Clark","Sure. Robert, it's Chris, I'll take a shot at that. As we look at the SG&A rate, obviously, we've been -- we're very pleased with the leverage we've gotten here at the last couple of quarters. And year-to-date, obviously, we're down, as I mentioned, 90 basis points as a percentage of sales. And I think that does reflect certainly the focused effort on the integration activities. And we would anticipate that continuing. But it also reflects that on our base businesses, we're really focused on driving cost savings as well. I would say, with respect to new products, we generally focus heavily as you know, on new products and as such, I think there's a fair amount of new product expenses, if you will, that's not only in our current P&L but also from prior year base. But I think that's really pretty steady for us if you look at it really across our portfolio businesses over time. So I wouldn't really anticipate necessarily a significant bubble there. I would say that as we look at -- we've got a headwind, as you know, in this year in 2013 related on the gross profit line related to medical device excise tax. And I would anticipate, as we move forward into 2014 and we annualize that impact, that the balance of the operating margin improvement may be a little bit more balanced, if you will, between gross profit and in SG&A moving forward. So I think right now, obviously, with the headwinds on MD and then medical device tax, we've been really focused on the operating expense side. And again, I think that as we move forward, we'll probably be a little bit more balanced on that.","Bret W. Wise","The only thing I'd add to that, Robert, is that you'll see us take these smaller restructuring charges from time to time, we took 1 here in the third quarter. That's us going after the fixed cost structure to try to improve the efficiency, both within our verticals and then across verticals, as well because sometimes there's synergies there as well.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. I know you guys both just mentioned the new product launches and I know, obviously, this is just part of the business model. But I guess I'm just trying to get a gauge as we head into 2014, as far as this launch cycle goes relative to prior years or relative to a typical year, any sense you can give us as far as are there more products coming into the market in this upcoming year and maybe anything around mix is how we should be thinking about the impact in the top line for your new schedule of launches? That would be helpful.","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, again, it's Chris. I'll take -- if you look at new products, I mean, we introduced in the north of 30 new products a year. And again, we really focus hard on ensuring that across to our verticals, if you will, that we've got a pretty consistent pipeline, if you will, of new products coming over time. And so for that and again, I guess I would just kind of characterize it as not really a single event or a single bubble, but really more of an ongoing process. So I really don't know that I'd say I see a necessarily significant change either up or down, either in terms of necessarily impact or for that matter, aggregate spend. Relative to mix, our new products do obviously help drive our sales mix. And in general, when we bring differentiated technology to market, that typically can help the gross margin mix. And so from that angle, I think that, that's usually accretive to us, or certainly helpful to us over time. There may be some initial launch cost that may bring that down a little bit, but certainly, our -- the newness of our portfolio helps us to differentiate in the drive price.","Operator","Next we'll go to John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Jim, a quick follow-up on the ortho market. On a unit basis, do you think the market is growing at this point? Or flat?","James G. Mosch","I would anticipate that it's flat.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","You think it's flat. Okay.","Bret W. Wise","I think it's likely, just to add to that, I think it varies by region. Certainly, U.S. could be a growing market for volume, but Europe is probably not at this point. So on balance, it's probably flat or maybe slightly up. But very, as Chris mentioned earlier and Jim said also, it's a very competitive market at this point.","James G. Mosch","There's no question, we're an economically driven market. So as we see lack of a robust economy, it is an elective procedure, so we won't see the growth. So I think overall, we have some reasons that are showing a little signs of hope. But overall, I think it still remains pretty flat.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Bret, I'm sure you're still in your planning mode for next year. But any initial thoughts do you think you can be up in the double-digit earnings growth mode?","Bret W. Wise","We are early -- as you noted, we're early in the planning stage. I'd rather defer that discussion until we come back on our fourth quarter call as we normally do. We'll give you guidance at that point. So I guess it's too early to send signals on that at this point.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then maybe one last one. Where do you stand on the Astra integration at this point? And what should we assume will be coming up in '14 on that front?","James G. Mosch","Actually, we -- I would say for all intents and purposes, we are complete. We had our last Go Live in Japan in June. That was our last major market. We did France and Germany at the beginning of the year. So we've really completed that integration for really all of our operating units around the world. However, obviously, we have multi-year integration plan. And as I mentioned in my comments, I mean, we continue to work to realize the identified synergies. And we worked toward that plan. And I think as we are right now, I think that's kind of consistent with what we had expected. So I think the major efforts will our ability to continue to execute that integration plan and realize the synergies.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So Jim, is the manufacturing consolidation done?","James G. Mosch","That was not identified and that's not part of the process. What we have done, to be clear on that, is that we have insourced some products that were outsourced previously. We've insourced in that into our manufacturing operation in Germany. And that was also part of the integration plan.","Christopher T. Clark","And this is Chris. I guess I'd add that, that John that's a multi-year effort. And again, I think that, that's we'll be getting some benefits on earlier this year. Benefits in 2014 will be even larger, and 2015 will be even larger than that.","Bret W. Wise","But sales, I think where Jim was going on earlier in his comments were was that the sales and marketing [indiscernible] which to us is the most difficult part is now complete. And just like in all of our businesses, we're focusing on efficiencies across the platforms and cost savings. So that's ongoing.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One clarification on currency, just a housekeeping question. Would you give us an update on your estimate of the impact of currency changes year-on-year embedded in the earnings outlook for '13?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. I can do that, Steve. As we look at it, we think at this point, based on current rates, we're expecting a negative impact for the year between $0.04 and $0.05. That's about a $0.01 improvement versus what we had coming into the third quarter. By the way, at third quarter, we had negative impact of about a $0.01. And it reflects a positive Euro comparison as the Euro has moved here. But also negative impacts, if you will, in emerging market countries and also developed countries outside of Europe, as well as less favorable impact from our cash flow hedges compared to last year.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then one on pricing specific to the U.S. I wonder if you could give us a sense for -- as you think back to the pricing strategy that you and the rest of the market took coming into this year. How much of that pricing would you estimate has stuck? How much is that contributing to market growth in the U.S.? And considering that we've probably picked up that there's some price inelasticity in the market, then why not be a little bit more assertive on pricing into '14?","Christopher T. Clark","It's Chris. Again, our typical price increase is in the 1.5% to 2% range. We were a bit north of that this year between the October 1 price increase last year, as well as the January 1 price increase this year. We think if I had to put a range to it, probably on average, maybe a point north of historical norms on average. And we think the bulk of that have stuck. We don't think necessarily all that has stuck. And then again, we highlighted a few of the pretty competitive markets, orthodontics being one that obviously becomes a little bit more challenging. That said, I think that for us, we do think price is a important variable along with innovation and a lot of other things that drive our leverage and drive our earnings. And again, that's something that we'll look to be on the reasonable end, but certainly not make sure we're not out of whack compared to market. But where we've got some pricing opportunities, we've historically been pretty up to take them.","Operator","And now we go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Actually I had the same question on the pricing strategy for '14, so I guess you just covered that. But just for background around the whole topic, I guess my question is, does it make sense from your perspective to telegraph these price increases to distributors overall? Just trying to figure out the strategy around that. I guess my general understanding is that manufacturers are trying to cut down on some of your quarterly sales volatility around this activity and typically you don't want to do anything to exacerbate it. Just kind of a better understanding this kind of just get a better feel for the strategy around that.","Bret W. Wise","This is Bret. The distributors are our business partners here in reaching the market. And we don't like to surprise them and frankly, won't surprise them so we typically tell them about our price increases about 6 weeks in advance. That gives them the time to do a couple of things: 1, develop their own inventory strategy; and 2, get the new pricing in their catalogs so they don't get stuck with in a position where they're buying at a higher price but still selling at an old price in their catalogs. So the discussion with them is balanced and that they're coming and here is what they are and that gives them time to react. What we did to kind of take the volatility out of the quarterly earnings for us was we moved all price increases, they go through the dealer channel to, at least in the United States, the October 1. And thus, we have the same phenomenon every year. Dealers buying ahead of price increase on October 1 and then liquidating inventory in the fourth quarter. That holds true except for 2012 when we had yet another price increase January 1 and thus, they didn't have the incentive to liquidate inventories in the fourth quarter. But generally speaking, we do telegraph the price increases -- well, not generally speaking, we always telegraph the price increases to the dealers so they have time to adapt their own business model.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then one other just real quick question here, just on the gross margins. I kind of missed some of the color on that. But again, the key factors that are driving gross margin down a little bit year-over-year how much of that is maybe mixed versus other factors?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. I mean, if you look at the year-on-year, there's a number of impacts here, Steven. The primary -- a lot of the net with the exception of medical device excise tax. So if you look at it, we're down 30 basis points on an adjusted basis in Q3 compared to prior year. The medical device in excise tax has been running us between 40 and 50 basis points negative for the year, so that kind of gives you some color there. As we look at it FX, is a bit of headwind as well to us on the gross profit line just to the way that some of the currencies break. We've had some nice synergies that have helped us on the gross profit line, mixes may be in aggregate a little bit negative. And again, those will swing quarter-to-quarter. So as we look at it, the way to kind of summarize it in aggregate would be everything pretty well netting. Maybe slightly positive with the exception of medical device tax. And that's basically saying, \"Hey we've got factors that are offsetting a currency headwind on our gross profit rate as well.\"","Operator","And next, with Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Most have been answered, but maybe just 1 or 2. I guess, the first one, Bret, on Europe. Your 3Q growth rate was largely in line with the second quarter yet decent size competitor mentioned what they thought was a slightly improving environment, notably in Western Europe. So what do you think is going on out there? Do you think your level of share gains in Europe are being maintained? I think -- do you believe the environment is starting to turn over in Europe or do you still categorize it as largely choppy?","Bret W. Wise","Let me just -- there's couple of points here, I think. One, is we have a hard time drawing any conclusions about Europe in the third quarter because many of those countries basically shut down for a good portion of the third quarter. So we don't put a place -- a lot of reliance on trend changes in that short period of time. Number 2, overall, what we saw in Europe is that the specialties are a little bit weak and the general consumables are stronger. So the dental market is still there, it's just the high-end procedures, the high-end kind of discretionary part of dentistry is not picking up or not growing as fast as general dentistry is, everyday dentistry. So we didn't -- we're not placing -- we had slow growth in the U.S. -- or excuse me, in Europe, 0.3% this quarter. I think the last quarter was like 0.8% or 0.9%. So it slowed just a little bit, Q2 to Q3, but we're talking about few basis points here and we don't place a lot of emphasis on that small change. The other thing I'll add is qualitatively, what we find in Europe, even today, even in a tough environment, when we bring new innovation to market, even at a recently high price point, the dental market there, particularly in the consumable category, the dental market there tends to have an appetite for that and we get some pick up in our sales growth. So we're comfortable that Europe is not changing a whole lot right now. Still kind of in the low or flat mode. And we're hopeful that the general economy can start to now slowly pickup and dentistry will usually follow, although at a 1 to 2-quarter lag.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It's very helpful. And then just quickly on the implant side of the business. I know there was a lot of earlier questions on the European dental implant market, but in the U.S., your growth rate decelerated. I think it was low double-digit last quarter to mid-single-digit this quarter. Again, one of the lower cost implant guys sort noted an acceleration from high-teens to 20%. So can you talk to your thoughts, and I know a couple of big guys are yet to report, but your thoughts on share within the U.S. dental implant business. And then, how is the premium implant market growing versus the value segment?","Bret W. Wise","Yes. From the standpoint of the U.S. dental implant market, I think we are -- we're pleased with our position and our growth in this market. Bret made the comment that with a little bit of underlying economic growth, we've seen some nice growth and in the implant market. That's very encouraging for the implant market overall. The U.S. organization was our first organization to go live. They've [indiscernible] really, I think at the highest level. We believe that we are taking share in that market. Your comment regarding double digits to mid-single digits is accurate. We do believe that there were some things in the prior year base and that in fact, that our Q3 business is probably stronger than what the actually the numbers show, so we are very positive about that. From a standpoint of the value players, I think we have seen less commentary and less discussion about that segment in the U.S. market versus other markets. And it still, we believe, is a very strong premium market. I think the implant companies are recovering well and performing well. And I think we're pretty confident about our position in that market and how we're growing it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to Glenn Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jeffrey Bailin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is_Jeff Bailin in for Glenn. Maybe just one question to switch gears here towards the end of the call. On the medical segment at the top, you guys mentioned that you had some particularly strong results there. Could you comment a little bit about what's been driving the strength? Is it new product launches or market share? Just maybe any color you could offer?","Bret W. Wise","Sure. Actually, Jim, you want to take that?","James G. Mosch","Yes, absolutely. Jeff, from a standpoint of the medical market, I think we've done well in this segment. A lot of our effort and a lot of our success is been new product related. We launched a female catheter about over a year ago. And we see nice growth from that. Actually, we're really rounding year 2 of that and we continue to see strong growth with that product. And we also launched a male catheter earlier this year, and that has done very well as well and we're seeing nice growth and expansion in both these categorize. These were categories that we needed some updates, we needed some improvements, we've made the investments. And we've seen very nice results in that segment. So overall. So we're pleased with this segment. I think our emphasis has really been on investment and new product development. The North -- the U.S. market continues to expand. Obviously, there's a higher usage of disposable intermittent catheters in this market and we've been benefiting from that as well.","Jeffrey Bailin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe one follow-up on the Rest of World growth up 4.6%. Could you comment a little bit about the trends that you're seeing in the emerging markets and maybe your strategies there to improve product penetration?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. I mean, it's Chris. Real quick on the emerging market growth. I mean, we're up basically high-single digits in terms of emerging markets. We're seeing pretty nice traction in, I guess, I would say in general, relative to our broad strategies. Focused again onto branding, focusing in on sales representation, focused on new products, et cetera. And again, I think that Jim commented on Middle East, Africa, reasonable recovery there. And again, I think that overall, we've continued to view these markets as very accretive to our overall growth rate, both now and moving in the future. So I mean, these continue to be focus areas for us.","Bret W. Wise","This is Bret. The one thing I would add to that is currency risk is pretty high in these markets. Recently, we've seen many currencies devalue slightly against the U.S. dollar or the Euro, which creates some headwind in getting products into these markets at a reasonable price point. But there's still a good appetite in these markets for dental products and growth there has remained kind of high single-digit overall throughout this year, so that's been favorable.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time, so I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional remarks.","Bret W.

It's clear that U.S. dentists continue to invest in their practice and remain highly interested in new and innovative ways to improve patient care and their workflows.","In the EU, we continue to see mixed market development. Overall, we saw some slowing particularly in the north, while there was some improvement in Southern Europe in the quarter. As far as the rest of the world, currency is creating some headwinds particularly for imported products in the many markets; however, for the most part, we see steady demand trends on a local level.","Moving on to our results for the fourth quarter, top-line growth was once again hit pretty hard by the currency devaluation around the globe. Total growth XPM was down 6.5% on an 8% negative currency impact. Constant currency growth was up 1.5% of which 1.0% was internal growth and 0.5% was net acquisitions, and we had both acquisitions and divestitures in that number, none of which were individually significant.","Regionally, the U.S. was up 3.1%, Europe was down 2.1%, and the rest of world was up 4.6%. The global internal growth rate disclosed here includes about a 1% drag or headwind from the discontinued products that we discussed on our last call.","In the U.S., the strongest categories were chairside consumable, dental specialties and our healthcare business, while lab was negative in the mid- to high-single digits. The discontinued products reduced the U.S. growth rate by 120 basis points in the quarter and, of course, that's in the lab segment that I just mentioned. Both the U.S. and European growth rates were impacted by the discontinued products in the quarter, and I'll let Chris provide you more details on that.","In Europe, we came up against a strong baseline where we grew almost 4% last year in the fourth quarter. In that region, each of chairside consumables, dental specialties and our other category which includes medical were essentially flat, while lab was down double digits. And again, that's driven heavily by the discontinued products in that segment.","The other factor that continues to hurt us here is CIS which was down high-single digits in the quarter. The currency devaluation happening in that region, as well as the economic situation in the CIS continues to negatively impact the dental market and our results as noted here. Rest of world, as mentioned, was up mid-single digits internally, it's led by Pacific Rim, Middle East, Australia and Latin America.","Staying with the fourth quarter, our operating margin expanded 220 basis points on an adjusted basis in the quarter and adjusted EPS was up 8% despite a net 8% drag on the bottom line from currency. So, currency neutral, it would have been much stronger, of course. This brought us to adjusted earnings for all of 2015 to $2.62, that's up 4.8% or about 11% on a currency neutral basis. This 2015 result is a couple cents above the high end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and that's despite additional headwinds coming from currency as we move throughout the year.","So, let's take a step back and look at these results in context. As you know, we've been very focused on improving the efficiency of our business over the past two years. In early 2014, we established a public target to attain a 20% operating margin by 2017 and that was off a 17.6% baseline at that time. In addition, we targeted improvements in asset turns, and as a result, a meaningful improvement in ROIC.","In 2014, we boosted operating margins by 80 basis points to 18.4%, and this year, we boosted them another 180 basis points to 20.2%. So, for the full year of 2015, we have achieved the target we had set out for 2017, only a couple of years in advance of the target date. At the same time, we were able to improve the asset turns, accelerate cash flow and grew our ROIC from the 8% range at the end of 2011, back firmly into our target zone of 12% to 15% where we exited 2015. This improvement happened without a lot of leverage from market growth, particularly in the EU.","This required a lot of hard work and creativity on the part of our employees, and I want to thank them for all their efforts they put forth to accomplish this result. We do feel pretty good about these results, although we acknowledge there's been some inconsistency on the top line, and in part, that does reflect some distraction and some disruption from the global efficiency program that we've implemented.","As we move into 2016, we're now implementing growth investments designed to accelerate internal growth. These investments will be funded from further savings from the efficiency program which is now entering its third year. And of course, this is the exciting part of the program and our employees are highly engaged and energized by the opportunity to reinvest and grow at a faster pace on the top line.","Before passing the call on for additional remarks from Jim and Chris, I'd like to add that our balance sheet is now in a very good shape. In 2015, we effectively paid down another $240 million on a net debt basis, and our net debt to cap ratio is now in the 27% range and the leverage ratio is below 1.5 times.","Said another way, I believe we're in very good shape to use our balance sheet more aggressively as we move forward. So, overall we feel like we're in good very place in which to build our future with Sirona. I would add that we are very excited and highly engaged and preparing for our future together with the Sirona employees and executive team. Our pending merger has very high potential and together we believe we can advance dentistry at a much faster pace from single visit dentistry to new and improved packaged solutions and workflows. We truly believe that the new DENTSPLY SIRONA will set the bar very high and be able to drive additional advancements for dentists and patients, increased opportunities for our employees, and of course provide a compelling value proposition for our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim.","James G. Mosch - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Bret. I'd like to provide an overview of our R&D efforts, update the status of the global efficiency initiative and outline the resulting reinvestment as part of this initiative. I'll then it over to Chris Clark for the financial review.","From an R&D perspective, Q4 saw the launch of Ceram.X Universal, a new universal composite with a unique SphereTECH filler technology. Also, the Midwest Tradition Plus high-speed handpiece offering improved reliability, power and noise reduction and the new Cavitron Touch Ultrasonic Scaling Unit providing a smaller footprint, digital user interface and improved ergonomics.","In addition, earlier endodontic launches of the X-SMART iQ and VDW.CONNECT motor platform and the ProTaper Gold and WaveOne Gold endo files continue to be registered and launched in expanded geographies. Each of these launches exceeded expectations and will carry momentum into 2016. As we look at 2016, new product development will be an area of significant activity. In Q1, we will launch SureFil SDR Plus. This will be an advancement of SDR, the number one bulk-filled global composite, and will provide higher wear resistance, expanded shades and increased radiopacity. We will also launch Calibra Ceram, the next-generation cement-specific for ceramic restorations including DENTSPLY CELTRA CEREC Block.","In addition, our healthcare business will be entering a new category bowel management with the launch of NAVINA. Often patients that utilize self-catheterization due to spinal cord injuries, cancer therapies and MS also have bowel management issues, which NAVINA provide a unique solution.","As Bret outlined, we made excellent progress on our global efficiency program launched in 2014. During this time, operating margin has moved from 17.6% in 2013 to a 2015 full year margin of 20.2%. This initiative has touched every area of the business, inclusive of procurement and supply chain, logistic consolidation, key business restructuring, formation of strategic business units, creation of single country organization, and process and system alignment across most functions. We've made great progress, but we have more to do and we will work in 2016 to meet the program objectives.","While the goal to improve operating margin was a mandate, equally important was the requirement to create funding for investments to drive long-term growth. This is an imperative on what has been a lower growth dental market. We began these investments in Q3 of this year, but they will accelerate as we enter the 2016 budget year.","In 2016, we will expand R&D investment to address the broader range of projects to drive long-term growth. Additional investment in clinical education programs will expand web and e-learning based program development, as well as program curriculum. We have identified sales excellence as a key driver of share gain. Our investment will support development of global sales training programs, tool development and global CRM implementation.","Finally, we will invest in sales expansion on a global basis in both developed and emerging markets. In total, we will increase our global sales force by more than 5%, our largest single-year expansion in over a decade. We strongly believe that these investments will improve the top-line growth trajectory of the business, while we seek to further expand the operating margin through the ongoing global efficiency initiatives.","I'd now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and our full-year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also by providing some additional color on both our balance sheet and our cash flow.","For the fourth quarter, sales excluding precious metals declined 6.5% compared to prior year as internal growth of 100 basis points and net impact from acquisitions of 50 basis points were more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 800 basis points. Reported internal growth of 1% was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points from product lines that had been discontinued in conjunction with our global efficiency program.","Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 58.9% of sales excluding precious metals, and that was an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year. This reflects favorable impacts of our global operational improvement efforts, currency and price.","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 38.9% of sales excluding precious metals, and that's down 70 basis points compared to our rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, also reflecting impacts of the global efficiency improvement initiatives","Operating margin for the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 19.9% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting the gross profit and the SG&A impacts that I just described.","Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.05 per share. It was approximately $0.015 worse than what we anticipated on the third quarter earnings call. This reflects in particular the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the Swedish krona over that period.","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.1%, while our operating tax rate was 23.2%, which was 110 basis points above our fourth quarter rate last year and about 40 basis points above our average operating tax rate for the first three quarters of 2015. This increase in the operating rate for the quarter was primarily the result of unfavorable geographic mix in the period.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the fourth quarter was $58.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share. And that compares to $84.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. These results include a number of items which are listed in the schedules in the release.","On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $92.6 million in the quarter, up nicely from $86.6 million from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65, up 8% from $0.60 in the last year's fourth quarter. On a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 16% over last year. That reflects the significant impact of our global operating efficiency improvement initiatives. We're very pleased with this performance and as we mentioned, are now focusing on driving reinvestments into the growth initiatives that Jim described.","Transitioning now to the full year 2015. Sales excluding precious metals declined by 7.6% compared to prior year. This internal growth of 2% was offset by headwinds from currency translation of 950 basis points and net acquisitions, divestitures of 10 basis points. Internal growth included the headwind from discontinued products of approximately 50 basis points on a global basis.","Internal growth for the year in the U.S. was 3.1% including the impact of approximately 75 basis points from discontinued products. For the year, the internal growth in Europe was negative 0.3% which included about 50 basis points from the discontinued products and a slightly larger headwind from the CIS region.","Internal growth for 2015 and the rest of world region was 4.9%, reflecting internal growth of almost 8% in the emerging markets within that region. For the year, the U.S. comprised 37% of our global sales, while Europe represented 41%, and the rest of world region, 22%.","Operating margin for the year improved by 180 basis points to 20.2% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis. And that compares to 18.4% last year. This reflects the full year impact of our global efficiency program, as well as the currency benefit moving through our cash flow hedges. On an adjusted basis, net earnings for the year increased to $373 million from $361 million in 2014, and adjusted earnings per share grew by 5%, to $2.62 per diluted share in 2015, from $2.50 per diluted share in the prior year.","Our results for the year include the negative impact from currency of approximately $0.16 which is about $0.02 worse than what we anticipated in our initial guidance for the year. On a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share for the year increased by approximately 11% over 2014, and we're very pleased with this operating performance for the year.","Moving on to cash flow, we're also pleased with our operating cash flow for the year of $497.4 million, although this trails 2014's record $560.4 million. Our cash flow performance reflects comparative headwinds versus prior year from four items. The timing of cash tax payments, payments associated with the restructuring plan, acquisition and merger-related cost and also the prepayment of the long-term bonds that we refinanced in December.","Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $425 million for the year, and our free cash flow conversion was 169% of reported net income for the year. As of year-end, inventory stood at 110 days which is down 5 days compared to September and down 3 days compared to December 2014. This was a pretty solid inventory performance for us in the quarter, although as a result, we had lower absorption in our plants and slightly higher cost in inventory as we come into the new year.","Account receivable days were 54 days at the end of December, that's down 6 days from prior quarter and down 1 day compared to December 2014. And the improvements in primary net working capital contributed $40 million to cash flow for the year, and that's on top of $38 million contributed in 2014. So, as I've indicated on previous calls, we believe we can continue to make significant progress over time in the net working capital area as a result of the global efficiency improvement efforts.","Capital expenditures for the year totaled $72 million; depreciation was $79 million for the year while amortization was $44 million. We did not execute any share buybacks during the fourth quarter. For the full year the company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at an average price of $52.50 per share.","We ended 2015, as Bret mentioned, with a pristine balance sheet as net debt to capital now stands at 27.1% at year-end compared to 32.3% at the end of 2014. And our leverage ratio of net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at 1.45 times compared to 1.87 times at year-end 2014. This obviously provides us tremendous flexibility as we move into 2016 on a combined basis with Sirona.","As we move into 2016, we are pleased with the operating performance of the business, particularly the traction from the efficiency program and now our ability to translate that into growth investments in addition to operating margin improvements.","A headwind to keep in mind is currency. And while rates are fluctuating rapidly, at current rates, we would anticipate a headwind to earnings of the DENTSPLY stand-alone business in 2016 of between 5% and 7%. Currency also flips from being a tailwind to operating margin rate in 2015 to becoming a headwind to that ratio in 2016. While, as Bret mentioned, we're not providing guidance at this time, I would state that we would expect positive year-on-year operating margin rate performance in 2016 despite the impacts from the currency and the growth reinvestments that were discussed earlier.","That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support. We'd now be glad to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go first to John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Bret, could you talk a little bit more about how Brazil and China are doing and maybe kind of the more emerging markets in general? Are you seeing any signs of deterioration given all the headlines we've been seeing?","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, John. I'd be glad to do that. I would say that China remained stable and a growth market for us. We haven't seen a lot of movement or weakening. It seems like dentistry is still kind of an emerging profession in China. The number of dental schools there that have opened is significant. The number of people entering the profession is significant, and dentistry is moving from kind of a street corner profession into a professional environment. So, the growth there is still good.","We saw continued growth in the quarter in Brazil as well, although we're watching that economy very closely. I'd say for us, that's a little bit higher risk than the Chinese situation at this point, although we continued to perform pretty well during this most recent quarter.","Emerging markets in general, I would say, are stable. The one exception to that is the CIS region which is kind of getting hit very hard on two sides. One is on the currency, and the other is on the economics coming from the dependency on oil. And that market continues to contract. But outside that region, I would say, the emerging markets still look stable to us and they're growing.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. That's helpful. The other question I had, if you think about your organic growth in the quarter of 1% \u2013 you talked a lot about new products. Could you sort of break that growth down between, let's say, price kind of your legacy line and what kind of contribution you think you got from new products in aggregate in the quarter?","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have that kind of an analysis at my fingertips. And then I frankly don't think we do break it down that way. I will say that on the quarters \u2013 the growth for this quarter, the disappointment for us was Europe which was weaker than we had anticipated. And as I stated in my opening comments, it was more Northern Europe than Southern Europe this time that kind of disappointed us.","The other thing that's holding our growth rate back, of course, is those discontinued products in the lab sector. But as far as quantifying the amount coming from new products, I don't have anything that would allow me to give you that at this point.","Chris, you have anything...","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","No, I don't.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I apologize for that but that's not something we have at our fingertips.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Bret, just following up, I guess, on your last point there. I mean, can you dig in at all in trying to figure why or try to give some reasons why Europe was disappointing this quarter? It seems like with some of the general consumables numbers out there from the distribution side that market held in fairly well. So, any color you can provide there on Europe?","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The two data points I have at this point are, one, the very large manufacture came out with, what they said, was low-single digit growth or close to zero growth. And we don't know, but I'm presuming that was impacted by Europe, because I would think their U.S. number would have been reasonably strong. So, the data point I have is our number, that manufacturer's number and then one distributor's number, I don't have any other distributors.","The one distributor that's out had very strong growth in their rest of world category, I don't know the breakdown between Europe and other regions. But if the implied European growth rate is close to what the rest of the world growth rate was, then I would say that was clearly above market. The other factor for us, of course, is CIS plays a pretty big role in our European number, and I'm not sure that it plays much of a role in the other numbers that we've seen out there at this point.","James G. Mosch - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll also say, our base was pretty strong. We're going up against.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","True. We had 4% baseline from the prior year. So, that's the color I can give you on that, Jeff, at this time. I do view that market as kind of flattish for the most part. Outside the lab sector, we were kind of flattish in most of our categories, so I think it's just a slow market right now or continues to be a slow market.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Understood. And I know you guys don't guide organic growth, you're not even \u2013 obviously, not providing guidance today, and you don't historically provide organic growth guidance anyway. But as Jim talked about some of the sales force investments that will be going in or sorry maybe that was Chris but as the discussion on the sales force investment some of the other things, would it surprise you over the next twelve months as a standalone company if organic growth didn't accelerate to a certain extent and to a decent extent at this point?","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, I got a couple of comments on that and I'll pass it over to Jim. The region economically seems to be kind of a constant state of flux and we see that for comments coming out of the EU. In general, I would say that the dialog we have with our general managers in Europe is not negative, it's positive. So, they are still upbeat. They see opportunities to grow. I would like to see that come through our numbers as we move into next year.","Jim, I'll let you comment on reinvestments, what impact you think?","James G. Mosch - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks. Jeff, yeah, I think one of the things we see and I think one of the benefits of the global efficiency program is the ability to make long-term investments. I think oftentimes you're in a situation where you're making investments within a year with the hopes of seeing a return in that year, those investments quite frankly are difficult to find. The global efficiency initiative has allowed us to make those longer term investments like sales force, like clinical education programs. The reality is those things have a pretty significant ramp. We don't see sales reps paying back in less than a year. Sometimes it takes time for them to get training up to speed. We can expect maybe a little bit of a lift but, overall, it is an operating investment certainly in this year. But, obviously, the longer term prospects are very good and those have been the kind of investments we need to make.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I'll just add to that that, although, they don't breakeven in the first year, you do start to see some sales growth come out of them probably in the back half of their first year. It's just not sufficient enough to cover the fixed costs.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And my last question, just can you remind us the timing here of when some of the headwinds from these divested products start to fall off, I think it's midyear, I just want to make sure as I'm building out the model, that's the accurate way to look at it.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Jeff, it's Chris. Some of those will come off midyear, some of those larger ones actually will start peeling off late in Q3. So, again, they're kind of staggered, but the anniversary, basically, again, midyear to late Q3 timeframe at this stage in the game.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Sorry to go back to Europe, but just wanted to ask on the impact of discontinued products on Europe in the quarter specifically, I'm not sure if you guys gave that in the prepared remarks.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It was just over 100 basis points for the quarter.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up to that, I'd be interested to get your thoughts on whether you think the discontinued products in lab or having any sort of residual or cross-over impact to other categories, I just wanted to know if this might be weighing on growth.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think it would have a lot of cross-over impact into other non-lab categories. But the restructuring we did in the lab category itself, including the discontinued products, could have, for a short period of time, some disruptive effect on other products in the lab category. But I don't see much possibility that it would stream over into other areas of the business.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Steve.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","My question just in relation to any upcoming 2016 guidance, and you did mention previously that the Sirona merger would be modestly accretive in the first year. I guess when you do give that guidance, I'm just curious, should we still assume, first of all, that that prior notion of modest accretion will still hold, and then do you know yet whether you'll quantify it or will this be kind of a sort of that general qualitative commentary around the accretion? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what to expect when you guys do provide that. Thanks.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't have details on what will be provided at a later point. That will be based on agreement of the new management team and so forth. Timing of transaction close \u2013 uncertainty of timing of transaction close weighs on that question of whether you get accretive in the first year or not because it does take some time to ramp up the synergies. But at this point, I think it's fair to say we believe we're close to a close date, and we believe the best pathway for us here, for the combined management team, would be to defer on the guidance and bring that out after we've closed in due course and had time to work together on it.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Then the other quick one, just in the press release you mentioned that you stated that the business is performing well fundamentally and see opportunities to accelerate the top-line growth as you move in to 2016. Just curious how much of that is maybe your own programs versus just what seems to be a fairly evident trend now that the overall industry is enjoying some accelerated top-line growth. Your comment there is sort of a combination of both of those or just curious to get what your thoughts on that as well? Thanks.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, that comment was meant to leverage off the fact that we're putting these reinvestments in now, which as Jim noted is probably the largest reinvestment for growth that we've had in this company for some time, maybe close to a decade. So, that was more driven towards the fact that we have some options that are within our own control now to invest for growth and we would anticipate we will see some pick up from that in a short period of time, certainly by the time we exit 2016.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I think just for the U.S. market in particular, there had been a lot of other companies in the dental sector that have talked about an expectation of the acceleration of organic growth for 2016 just from the \u2013 just the macro trends. Do you endorse that view right now for U.S. specifically, or do you not want to make that prediction right now?","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I wouldn't be surprised if that happened. The dentists today seem open to listen to new ways to invest in their practice and drive their own productivity or improve patient outcomes. And you see that evidenced in the growth rates that the dental companies are experiencing in the U.S. I wouldn't be surprised to see it accelerate because of overall macro trends. Although when you read the Wall Street Journal, and you wonder what the macro trends are really going to be for the next year.","So, again, our comments were \u2013 our view is we're trying to improve our position despite what the market does. And these reinvestments I think will do just that, allow us to grow above market irrespective of what the macro trends are.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel.","Ethan T. Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. This is Ethan Roth on for Jon Block. I have two questions here. The first is on rest of world, I think we were a little bit surprised to see the internal growth not pick up from last quarter when you called out a temporary loss of production at a facility in China. I think we had that maybe about 300-basis-point drag. Did that swing back the other way and positively impact your growth this quarter as some of the product went out the door?","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","No. Ethan, it's Chris. I would say it was a pretty normal quarter for us relative to China. I mean we're back in production. We probably did lose some sales over that period of time as customers probably went to other brands during that brief period we couldn't supply. But no, we didn't really expect nor did we see, I would say, an incremental snap back. We saw a return to, what I would say, to be pretty normal consumption. If you look at the high 4%s in terms of internal growth rate for the rest of world region, that's pretty much what that region has been doing on average over a reasonable period of time here.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kind of mid-single digits. And we need to keep in mind that when we say rest of world, it includes many developed markets, not only emerging markets. So, there's a balance there between the two categories in that number.","Ethan T. Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And the second just more of a housekeeping question. I noticed acquisitions were actually a net benefit this quarter, whereas you've had some divestitures that were a drag to the first part of the year. Can you share with us any details on either what the acquisition was by product or in which geographies? Thanks.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We purchased a small prosthetics business in Latin America.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That was driven by one single acquisition that's now offsetting the divestitures, none of which were really material individually.","Ethan T. Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey, guys. It's actually Michael Clerico on for Steve today.","Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Michael.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Could you just quantify \u2013 hi, guys. Could you just quantify the benefit from currency on the operating margins this quarter as well as the \u2013 what was the drag from CIS on European growth?","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Relative to the quarter, about a fifth of the operating margin improvement was related to currency.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","The rest again \u2013 the significant amount came through as a result of the global efficiency improvement program as I noted.","And I'm sorry, Michael, the second question?","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. And the drag from CIS on the European growth rate?","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","For the quarter \u2013 I'm sorry. It looks like about 50 basis points maybe, maybe 50 basis points to 60 basis points, in that range.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my second question, on working capital, you've made some nice improvements. Could you talk a little bit about going forward on standalone basis efforts to keep that improvement up and things that you're doing? If you could just comment on what the initiatives there are and how you view that going forward?","Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Again, there's a significant focus in this area. I think we talked about that it in previous calls as well. Number one, these metrics \u2013 we've had metrics in place from a management standpoint to focus in on that. Again, that's certainly \u2013 those targets have \u2013 I think that focus has helped.","Secondly, as part of our global efficiency improvement program, the synergies associated with reducing distribution points moving to coordinated global inventory planning and control, again, all those common processes, point rationalization as appropriate, I mean, these \u2013 all these movements significantly streamline and simplify a pretty complicated supply chain.","So, again, we believe that there's still significant room to go. This is a gradual effort. I don't think you should measure it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but you should measure it over multiple quarters and expect continued progress. And, again, we're pleased with the progress thus far. But, again, we're early in the mid-innings in terms of that metric at this stage in the game.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co.

Wainwright","David Stratton - Great Lakes Review","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Dentsply Sirona, Incorporated fourth quarter and year-end 2017 earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Josh Zable, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Josh Zable","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings press release and presentation is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And, with that, I will now turn the program over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.","Don Casey","Thanks Josh and good morning everyone. This is the first time some of you are meeting either Nick Alexos or myself, so we really appreciate you joining us. I would like to accomplish a few things this morning. The first is to provide some of my initial impressions. The second is to outline some key areas. And finally, I will discuss what you can expect from this management team going forward.","While it's very early in my tenure, as a fact this marks the end of week three for me, much of what I have seen confirms my rationale for accepting this role. It also reinforces why I am confident that my previous experiences align well with what DENTSPLY SIRONA will need going forward. The few weeks have underscored that this is a great company in an attractive market, but is one that's also coming off a challenging year in terms of financial performance as well as one with lots of changes in management. We have now turned the page on that.","We have a new management team in place that is excited about our future. Looking at that future, I know we have several great assets that we can leverage. They include being the number one or two brands in multiple consumable categories. These categories provide a reliable and stable source of growth. But beyond that, each of these brands represents an opportunity to build a relationship with dentists and labs, whether in areas like endodontics, preventive, restorative, our products touch hundreds of thousands of dentists around the globe each year, all of which represent an opportunity to start a conversation.","Our leadership position in technology and equipment such as CAD\/CAM and imaging is another major strength and is an important foundation for future growth. It is up to us to better leverage that relationship to bring in all aspects of our portfolio to these dentists that are already very committed to DENTSPLY SIRONA.","In some places, we are beginning to see the power of combining our differentiated products into one offering. Among the many examples we could cite is a program where we now offer digital impression with the implant in a novel program to cross-sell both products. This not only improves our value proposition versus the competition but is driving new sales leads for both franchises. And as a matter of fact, we are starting to see implants return to growth after two down years.","This is a model that we would like to replicate in several other product categories. But our competitive advantage is more than just offering leading products. We can bring the power of our clinical education and training along with our products to truly become a solution provider. Having such a broad portfolio allows us to be a leader in this space that no other competitor can match.","We bring this broad education and training portfolio to our customers on a daily basis in the market and through major events like Dentsply Sirona World. Our breadth also gives us a lot of flexibility in creating novel win-wins for our important dealer-partners such as Patterson and Henry Schein. Going forward, our entire team understands the need to take the potential of DENTSPLY SIRONA and turn it into performance.","An initiative that was kicked off late last year brought our senior leadership team together to identify our top five priorities. They are starting to bear fruit and we will continue to push them. They include delivering on the concept that we are the dental solutions company and acting as one team globally. But I would also like to highlight two of these initiatives that I will personally own, growth and margin improvement.","Our growth plans going forward will be built around a few key priorities. The first is sales force effectiveness. At DENTSPLY SIRONA, we have 30-plus sales force and close to 5,800 people globally in sales and sales-support. It is essential that we improve the performance of this group. That includes targeting, messaging, training, use of sales force productivity tools, all while providing outstanding customer service and it includes teaching our businesses how to cross-sell each other to take advantage of our unique portfolio. And finally, but not least, there needs to be a renewed focus on our customers. For the past two years, we have been too internally focused. That changes now.","The second key to growth will be to accelerate the pace of innovation. This is our life blood. We will do this by really understanding our customers, looking globally at their needs, reallocating investment into higher-margin areas and creating urgency. I strongly believe that we can take our industry-leading R&D budget and redirect it into high-impact projects that give us a better competitive position. In a rapidly changing competitive space, our technology portfolio is unmatched. It gives us a tremendous amount of optionality and it will serve as an important foundation for our leadership in the ongoing digital revolution in dentistry. It is our intent that innovation will be at the heart of everything we do.","Our final focus area will be to grow into rapidly developing areas around the globe such as Asia, Latin America and the Middle East where we have a long history and excellent sales foundation and also a tremendous opportunity. We will make more investment and resources available where we can see near and mid-term returns. Our urgency in restarting our growth engine is high.","One way we will deliver is taking immediate action. Yesterday, we announced the change in our management structure. Going forward, the commercial leaders as well as the two R&D leads will now report directly in to me. I intend to be a hands-on leader and believe this structure will accelerate decision-making and increase accountability. I want to thank Bob Size for his contributions over the years and for taking on the interim leadership role during our management transition.","Another area of particular emphasis will be accelerating growth within our technology and equipment business. Having concluded initial reviews, I am confident that we have a very strong product portfolio that we will be looking to augment over the mid-term. I have also had the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time with both our leadership team and that of our critical partners, Henry Schein and Patterson. I believe that we have put solid plans in place to drive growth in the equipment areas and we will look to strengthen those plans together in the future. We have also worked with them to get better visibility into our movement of the product at the end market. This retail visibility will allow us to rapidly determine the impact of our efforts and adjust them as needed.","In addition to growth, the second of the priorities that I personally own is our program to improve margins. We have scale but we need to put it to use. Our team is focused on delivering $100 million in cost savings over the next two years. Given the early stage we are at in areas like procurement, rationalizing our manufacturing footprint and looking to make our operating model more efficient, I believe that we have significant runway in these areas. Some of these savings are being reinvested today, but we will begin yielding margin improvement, both in the back half of the year and beyond.","The final point that I would like to make is what we, as a management team, aspire to be. We believe that we can and should be a growth company, built on industry-leading go-to-market capability, world-class R&D and being a global solution provider. We will selectively add to our organic efforts through licensing and when appropriate, acquisitions. We understand that we need to deliver on our commitments consistently and with transparency. Our team is committed to doing just that.","I am not na\u00efve about this challenge and it's going take some time. But I just returned from the Chicago mid-winter event where I got to walk the floor, meet with multiple customers, talk to KOLs and I got to see our team in action. It's impressive. As part of my onboarding, I have had the pleasure of meeting literally hundreds of DENTSPLY SIRONA employees that all have an amazing passion and commitment to this company. All of this highlights the tremendous opportunity to go from talking about the potential of DENTSPLY SIRONA to delivering consistent performance. I look forward to getting to spend time with the investment community in the future.","Now I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Nick Alexos, who will provide a more detailed look into our results and our underlying assumptions for our 2018 outlook. Nick?","Nick Alexos","Thanks Don and good morning everyone. I have been equally impressed by the caliber of our people, the strength of our businesses and the opportunities we can pursue to add value to all our constituents. It's also been a great month for us working with Don from the date of his announcement.","Let me start by commenting on our 10-K. By now, you have seen that we filed a Form 12b-25 for an extension of our filing date. We expect to file the 10-K by early next week and certainly prior to the expiration of the extension. Given our determination of an impairment, the complexities of tax reform passed last year and frankly the recent management changes, the extra days are helpful. Please be assured in my confidence in the financial controls of our organization, which brings me to the impairment charge.","For Q4 2017 period,, we took a charge of $848 million to reflect evaluation related to our technology and equipment assets. This is comprised of $267 million related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $581 million on goodwill. The charges are due to changes in projected operating performance as well as changes to our tax and foreign exchange rates. I will speak to each of these.","In simple terms, although we shipped orders as planned in Q4 of 2017, our retail sell via our channel partners in certain markets was less than we expected. Rather than decreasing channel inventory by $30 million as was referenced in our November Q3 call, we ended with an increase of $21 million, mostly in imaging and CAD\/CAM units in the U.S. and to a limited degree in other geographic regions. As a result, we have a lower growth rate in 2018 to reflect a now targeted $40 million of equipment inventory reduction and lower consumption as well as slightly reduced long-term growth rates in margins for these reporting units. Fundamentally, we still believe the growth rate of our technology and equipment segment to be in the mid-single digit range and our CAD\/CAM unit to be above that.","2017 was clearly a transition year, especially in North America, but our dual distribution model makes sense and we value our partnership with both Patterson and Henry Schein. Importantly, we have now aligned to better track our inventory and as Don mentioned, we are aggressively working on our sales and marketing strategies globally. In April, for example, our imaging equipment was seamlessly will integrate into Henry Schein's dentists' practice management software for the first time. We anticipate that this should help boost sales of imaging products in the back half of the year. We are also very confident in our continued partnership with Patterson leveraging their significant customer service infrastructure for their equipment sales.","The second and separate element of the impairment charge is the calculated higher effective tax rate, which was primarily driven by U.S. tax reform legislation past December of 2017. Although recent tax will reduce the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21%, other aspects of the legislation actually diminish the use of foreign tax credits as well as our ability to defer tax on foreign income. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions continue to reform their tax policies and broaden their tax base. Since DENTSPLY SIRONA's effective tax rates are expected to marginally increase over time, the projected net cash flows associated with the evaluated assets were reduced.","The third element of the impairment charge relates to changes in the foreign exchange rate projections versus the fair value model that was completed for the April 30, 2017 annual goodwill impairment testing. In general terms, while stronger foreign currencies and especially the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar are good for the company's total earnings, a strong Euro in particular increases the cost structure of the equipment reporting units which are primarily based in Germany and Austria. This in turn unfavorably impacts the fair value of these reporting units as a result of the reduction in their profitability.","At the same time, while the fair value is lessened from the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar, the book value of these reporting units increase at December 31, 2017 as a result of the significant underlying Euro based balance sheet values of these German and Austrian operations. For the fiscal year 2017, the total impairment charge related to these assets is now over $2 billion which is meaningful, although a non-cash charge.","The historical successes of our technology products has no doubt drawn increased competitive offerings in the market which has also pressured margins. As Don highlighted, we as a company have not executed on several facets. Nonetheless, our forecasted growth is based on our continuing investments in innovative technologies in both our technology and equipment and consumables segments and investments in our global sales and marketing efforts working along our channel partners.","Now let me review some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year. As provided in our supplemental financials, this quarter we began reporting in two segments as part of our priority to simplify the business. This also represents how we intend to drive the strategies of the company. You can find the detailed historical growth rates of these segment and regions in the financial supplements provided along with our press release and the earnings presentation.","For the fourth quarter, constant currency total sales increased 5.3%, driven by technologies and equipment, which increased 5.8%. As I said earlier, based on our estimates, total technology and equipment sales were favorably impacted by approximately $21 million in equipment inventory build during the quarter. Consumables constant currency sales grew at 4.6% with broad growth across categories, which is a pretty solid quarter for them","Regionally, the U.S. posted strong growth but was the beneficiary of what we estimate to be $23 million in channel equipment inventory build during the quarter. This overlaps the $21 million I just mentioned for the total sales figure. Europe was up 2.6%, also driven by stronger technology and equipment growth and the rest of world was up 3.7%. All of these percentages are in a constant currency basis.","When we look at revenues for the year, it's a similar story. Sales of the combined businesses, which is the pro forma for a January 1, 2016 merger date,, grew 1.6% on a constant currency basis. The U.S. benefited from what we estimate to be full year $38 million in channel inventory build but it was down in total for the year at a negative 0.5%. Europe was up 4.1% pro forma on a constant currency basis. And the rest of world was only up slightly for the full year at 0.8% on the same basis.","As Don said, the integration impacted our rest of the world organization, which grew significantly lower than it should. As you will also see, the consumables sector for the year grew at 3.7% whereas technology and equipment was marginally negative, once again on a constant currency basis. In general, we believe our end markets are stable and growing. Our performance should improve with better execution as we have discussed.","Turning to margins for the quarter. We improved our adjusted margin rate versus a year ago, which was a function of stronger product and regional mix and higher volumes creating SG&A leverage. For the year, adjusted operating margins declined as our expenses grew while our sales did not. We have made some growth investments that take 12 to 18 months to deliver and we should start to see the benefit of them in the back half of 2018.","Q4 reported GAAP EPS was a loss of $2.95 and the full year GAAP EPS was a loss of $6.86, both reflecting the impairment charges we have discussed. Adjusted EPS for Q4 was a positive $0.82 and for the full year 2017 adjusted EPS was $2.66, which is in line with the updated guidance provided in November. As I said earlier, shipments was as planned in Q4, but the retail sales in equipment lagged our expectation.","Cash flow from operating activities was $602 million, up 6.8% for the year despite increases in net trade working capital that needs to be reduced. Operating cash flow is an important indicator of the health of our business and an area we can improve. CapEx for the year was $144 million. This is something that we will also monitor to ensure that capital spend is delivering appropriate returns.","During the quarter, you will note that we executed on two small transactions, one in preventive and one in endo. Over the year, we spent $153 million in small tuck-in acquisitions that will help us grow faster.","Now turning to guidance. Our guidance includes the following assumptions. Full-year constant currency sales growth around 3%, free any meaningful acquisitions or divestitures that have not closed yet. At the current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion for 2018. As I discussed earlier, our revenue assumptions include about $40 million targeted reduction in dealer equipment inventory, which is costing us about a 1% growth rate overall. We expect to reduce a large portion of the dealer equipment inventory levels in the first part of the year, which will clearly impact the performance of the U.S. business. Also keep in mind that Europe faces last year's IDS comps as well in Q1.","We expect gross margins and operating margins to be flat to slightly down versus 2017 as underlying margin rate improvement in businesses are expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and the headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions. As Don mentioned, we are committed to delivering $100 million in operating cost savings by fiscal year 2019 and we expect more than half of that to be in 2018. Although we expect the savings to result in increased margin over time, as I mentioned 2018 margins are being impacted by the foreign exchange, the inventory reductions and certain investments during the year. Below the operating line, we have also taken steps to reduce our interest expense by approximately $20 million. Overall, we have a very low cost debt structure and ample availability to grow our businesses and make acquisitions.","On taxes, as I said, there is a meaningful change in the non-GAAP effective tax rate from 17.4% in 2017 to now estimated 22% for 2018. Once again, this is based on the changes in the U.S. tax legislation, which reduce our foreign tax credits and limit our abilities to defer foreign tax income. Please note, only approximately 35% of our revenues are from the U.S.","CapEx guidance for the year is expected to be similar to 2017. There are clearly many variables to our EPS guidance throughout the income statement, which we manage. Excluding $0.16 impact due to the change in non-GAAP effective tax rate I had outlined, our guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 for 2018 underlines EPS growth rate of 8% to 11%. We have not incorporated any material share repurchases into this guidance. So to summarize, we believe we have taken the right actions to prepare for revenue, profit growth and strong cash flows in 2018 and margin improvement over time.","And I turn the call over to Don for some final remarks.","Don Casey","Thanks Nick. And I would really like to thank you and your entire team. It's been a very busy time and you have done a lot of really great work and I have spend just a tremendous month getting to know you and the entire team as well as the DENTSPLY SIRONA team.","Before we open up to questions, I want to reemphasize how much we value your interest and we plan to organize an Investor Day at some point at one of our facilities. We also plan to provide you at that time with our long-term views on the business in terms of revenue growth, margin and capital allocation. We look forward to getting that date on your calendar shortly.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will hear first from Glen Santangelo of Deutsche Bank.","Glen Santangelo","Hi. Good morning. Don, just wanted to talk to you about underlying growth trends. First, on the consumable side. 2017, I think most saw that consumable sales were probably a little bit lower than expected, as dental volumes were a bit lower, but now that you are the last dental company to report, we have heard from Danaher, Schein and Patterson and the numbers are kind of a little bit all over the place. So I just want to get your perspective, given your market share and your global reach, what are you all seeing in terms unit volumes and consumable sales on an organic basis?","Don Casey","Glen, thanks for the question. It's good to talk to you again. We feel pretty comfortable that we are seeing solid growth in the consumable areas. And look, we are a global business. Our bellwether, preventive and restorative business has pretty good growth over this year and we think we are probably gaining a little bit of share. So when you think about our consumable business on a constant currency basis growing about 4.6% and gaining a little bit of share, that would point to mid-single digit growth. So we feel that there is some good positive underlying trends. We like to think that some of that is due to our market share and the programs we are putting into place in the market.","Next question.","Operator","And we will hear next from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hi. Good morning. In light of the impairment charge and the recalibration of the underlying growth for some of the businesses, can you talk a little bit more about the strategy to reaccelerate growth overall? Where are you making incremental investments? Is it aligners, CAD\/CAM, implants or other areas? And when can we start to see some returns? And can you also talk a little about inorganic? How actively you are looking at M&A at this point?","Don Casey","Thanks for the question, Tycho. And I will start and I will ask Nick to amplify. Look, if you think about our CAD\/CAM business, we are big, big believers in digital dentistry, chair side dentistry. And we are going to continue pushing that. One of the things that I have noted just literally right off the bat is an opportunity though to how do we expand and take some of our equipment that's got great footprints and playing more aggressively in the digital impression space. So that's the first thing we are doing and we are working immediately with our team to make sure that our customers understand that we in fact have equipment that will let them play in that space. So that's the first thing.","The second, as you look at this space, it's gotten more competitive. When you build a really, really good, high-profit, high-growth category like CAD\/CAM, you are going to invite competitors. So one of the things that we want to do is, first we want to continue driving innovation and I think we are pointing to, what we think will be a pretty good set of launches around the IDS show and beyond and we are going to continue to innovate in that space.","The other thing, Tycho, I think I mentioned in my script, as you go through that, I am really excited about the opportunity to bring much more disciplined sales force effectiveness into this area. As we think about the relationship we have with our partners, both Patterson and Henry Schein, in the past we have relied a lot on them to create some of the demand and I think we are going to really begin to focus on how do we work with them, but also how do we take responsibility for creating the leads and ultimately driving our business. And I think you are going to start to see that in the back half of the year when we have a little bit of time with our management team to get after it.","Nick, what would you want to add?","Nick Alexos","Yes. Tycho, I would just add that I think this process has highlighted a great way to prioritize opportunities to invest, both to drive growth as well as improve the operations of the business. And we want to do those in the context of the guidance that we have provided you.","Don Casey","Next question?","Operator","And we will hear next from Jeff Johnson of Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thanks. Good morning guys. Can you hear me okay.","Don Casey","Yes.","Jeff Johnson","All right. Great. So Nick, maybe just to start with you or Don, either one. So over the last few years, I think we would all admit that innovation has been somewhat lacking at DENTSPLY. It sounds like you are going to take this first $50 million tranche of cost saving and reinvest it back into the business. I don't think anybody is going to argue with that. But I would like to hear kind of that second tranche of the $50 million out of the total $100 million. Do you think that flows through better? Does the first $50 million drive some better topline? I am just trying to think all the way to 2019 at this point. Do things start to flow through at a better rate there? And then Nick, just also wondering, you say no repurchase in the guidance. How do you feel about repurchases, especially with your stock at these depressed levels? I can understand not putting it in guidance, but just conceptually how do you think about the level of your stock at these levels? Thanks.","Don Casey","Yes. Jeff, first, thanks for the questions. I will let Nick jump in, in a second. There were two questions in there and let's talk about what are we investing in and I completely agree. We need to jumpstart our innovation engine and that's where we are putting some of it. Some of the savings are being driven right into innovation as well as sales force effectiveness. We need to improve some of the tactics, some of the messaging and some of the programs we are putting together. So that's the first thing.","The second, as we think about the back half and where we want to grow and how do we want to grow, look, we have just begun to scratch the surface of how do we cross-sell. I mean the example that we talked about a second, a minute ago was about how do we take our imaging equipment and work better with implants. And we think we have got a lot of opportunities that way. When we talk about share repurchase, it's very, very early for me and I just want to emphasize, look, I want to grow and this is going to take us a little while to get our hands around this. This is why you don't see us coming right out the gate talking aggressively about share repurchase. And the priorities are, how do we grow, are there technologies or M&A that we can be doing that will accelerate growth. And then after that, we will commit to returning excess cash to shareholders. But right now, it's going to take us a little bit of time to get our arms around it. But I would tell you, our priorities are growth.","Nick, I don't know what you want to add.","Nick Alexos","Yes. Jeff, I would just add, as you know and you heard, there are a lot of variables here and we feel very good of how we have brought them together to give you the guidance that we have provided. And in deference to the whole team and especially Don, there is a lot more work to do to prioritize. I look at the cost savings, the growth investments and cash flow somewhat independently. The cost savings were targeted to go after inefficiencies in the business and we feel very comfortable that we will get those. Separate from that, we are constantly looking at investments and have done some even in the last few months in order to either improve efficiencies or drive topline and those will overlap to some degree. And then cash flow will be the net result of an overall assessment of capital allocation strategies. As I noted, the guidance does not include any meaningful share repurchases. So give us a little bit of a buffer and range in terms of what we determine will be the right allocation of capital in 2018 and we will obviously update you guys during the year as we progress.","Don Casey","Thanks for the question, Jeff. Next question?","Operator","And we will hear next from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Hi. Good morning, Don and Nick. Thanks for taking the question. I guess looking at the components of your 2018 guidance, it does seem like you are implying flat to maybe even down EBIT margins for the year? I would have thought you would see some improvement with the distributor change now largely behind you, you guys talked about the synergies ramping. So I guess how are you thinking about margins in 2018? I known, Nick, you mentioned seeing some margin pressure in the technology portfolio. But are there any other specific dynamics or headwinds that we should be thinking about for the margins in 2018?","Nick Alexos","Yes. Bob, very fair question and thank you. I would say the one notable element is, we do have significant foreign exchange variability, as I noted, with regard to the impairment. There is a significant cost structure for our European businesses and so that is definitely creating some margin pressure which also impacted the impairment value. Net net, we actually benefit from foreign currency or dollar weakening, foreign currencies improving, given the global nature of this business. But on a margin basis, it actually creates a bit of a headwind which is reflected in the numbers. We have a wide range of businesses and I can tell you, some will see margin improvement and in some other areas we will see some margin pressure. But the net amount is, as I said, slightly negative for the year is at least what we have penciled out.","Don Casey","Thanks Bob. Next question?","Operator","We will hear next from Jon Block of Stifel.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about long-term pricing power. There has been sort of that chatter that pricing power among the distributors may diminish over time. Schein has talked to repricing amongst DSOs. And I guess we need to see GPOs play out over time. But what does that mean for you guys as the leading manufacturer in the market? I would love to get your thoughts on, if you are insulated from that risk a little, a lot? And maybe you can talk to how prices played into your revenue growth over the past 24 months? And Nick, how you see that evolving going forward? Thanks.","Don Casey","Yes. Jon, first, thanks for the question. Look, we are going to focus on developing innovative and differentiated products and we are going to charge fair value for them. We are working well with the DSOs. We have got a terrific relationship with them. And as we view one of our imperatives to get after and focusing on the customer, we are going to work with them to understand how we can best serve their needs. But as I said in my script, I am very excited about the idea that we are going to be developing innovative products that are going to be differentiated and we would expect to get differentiated pricing.","Nick Alexos","Yes. I would just add, Jon, that there is no notable distinction in our pricing strategies going into 2018 or beyond. That's really left down at the trade level, as it makes sense in the field. And historically, yes, one of the things I liked about this business is that historically we are able to get reasonable price increases throughout our product lines.","Operator","And so we will hear next a question from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. How should we think about the inventory build in the quarter? How is this communication between your distributor partners and the inventory management there? I guess, how are those supplier relationships progressing? What changes can be made at this point? And then more broadly, what does this say, if anything, on underlying demand trends on the equipment side? Thanks.","Don Casey","Yes. Erin, thank you for the question. First, we think we have got terrific relationships with both partners. As a matter of fact, at the mid-winter last week, we were able to spend a fair amount of time with the leadership of both companies and we reminded how important they are as part of our process. One of the things we emphasized in those meetings is that we really need to get visibility to the end user, almost retail sales, if you will, because not only do we need to understand the underlying inventory, we also need to be able to adjust our programs on the fly to see what's working and what's not working. So that's a program that both of us, both of the partners and us really want to emphasize and we think we have got good line on that.","On the underlying trends, there's a couple of things on. I mean, the first is, there is more competition and the second, as you are bringing Henry Schein on and Patterson and they now have options to sell multiple things. So I think it's taking a little while for them to figure out how to drive business. In our meetings with both of our partners, we emphasize the need to grow our business and we think we put plans in place and we are pretty excited about where we are return to growth.","One of the underlying trends, though, that we need to conscious of, in some cases you may have emphasis moving away from the chairside dentistry and the CAD\/CAM and moving into a little bit more into DI where they are looking to just by pieces of the system versus the entire system. And again, we spent a fair amount of time with both Patterson and Henry Schein talking about what we think is just a much better patient experience, which is CAD\/CAM and we want to be able to provide them as well as our own reps an opportunity to participate a little bit more aggressively in DI and that's why we are going to be pushing that as well.","Next question. Thanks.","Operator","And will hear from John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger","Thanks very much. Don, you mentioned sales force effectiveness a few times. Can you just go back to that? Our perception is, legacy SIRONA and legacy DENTSPLY had fairly different sales strategies. So when you came in the door, what did you find? And do you feel like that the broad structure is in place? Or is there a fairly significant recasting that is necessary, from your point of view? Should be thinking about more salesman, less salesmen? Are you going to change where those sales forces are focused? Any elaboration will be helpful.","Don Casey","Thanks for the question, John. It is interesting. I think that there is a certain legacy DENTSPLY and a legacy SIRONA. One thing that I have actually brought in is the fact that I didn't come from either company and we are going to spend a lot of time as DENTSPLY SIRONA. And whether the culture came from more of the consumable side which is relatively consistent program or whether it's a little bit more of the highs and lows that go along with equipment sales, we need to actually begin to do a much better job of leveraging across each other.","So when you think about our community of CEREC dentists, I mean that that to me is something that we need to leverage in a big, big way and we need to help the technology and equipment people learn to bring the consumables right along. And one of the things, John, that we are going to spend time is making sure that all our sales forces have the opportunity to at least create leads or begin to work with our distributor partners to bring our other products in there. And that's going to be a pretty aggressive priority.","The second is, I don't think it's a big recast. I think some of it is, let's just talk about consistency. Consistency in targeting, consistency in message and in my mind, it is how do we bring sales force automation so that we are creating a great CRM program that allows the cross-selling that we are talking about. So again, having spent time with the sales forces that have spent most of their lives in the consumables business, they get excited, hey, if we can create leads, terrific. When we were talking to the technology and equipment people, they have really not thought about how do I actually bring some of these consumables. And an example that we cited in the script a little bit ago was actually how are we bringing implants and imaging together in a novel way. And that's got people's attention internally because it's starting to work. So I don't look at it as a big recast. I acknowledge that there are some differences in the legacy cultures but we are going to operate as one company. We are going to operate aggressively and sales force effectiveness is probably the most immediate way that we can pull a lever to really start accelerating sales this year.","Next question.","Operator","And we will hear from Yi Chen of H.C. Wainwright.","Yi Chen","Thank you. Do you expect to recognize more goodwill impairments during 2018?","Nick Alexos","Just first, thanks for the question. Yes, the straightforward answer is no. We obviously have done a very thorough analysis of our business and the valuation of these assets and this is the determined impairment charge that we have calculated based on our long-range projections of the business.","Don Casey","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","And we will go to David Stratton of Great Lakes Review.","David Stratton","Good morning. Thanks for the question. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your near to mid-term investment in underdeveloped geographies and how that differs from what DENTSPLY SIRONA has done in the past and kind of where you see that trending going forward?","Don Casey","Yes. David, first, thanks for the question. It's really interesting when you come in and again at the end of week three, the thing that actually surprised me is just how much of a global company we are. We do are close to $1 billion in sales in some of these regions. And we have had tremendous legacy presence there and we have just begun to scratch the surface of what it looks like in bringing other products to these regions. So look, do they have all the people they need, all the investments they need and all the resources they need, probably not. And that's one of the things that I think I look forward to talking more about as we go forward in the future. But it's a region that's growing. It's got positive demographics. You have got the economies going the right way. And it's a place that we absolutely want to be growing.","Next question.","Operator","And at this time there are no other questions in the queue. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Casey, CEO of DENTSPLY SIRONA for any closing comments.","Don Casey","Well, first, thank you very much. We look forward to getting back and talking to you in May. And as I indicated, we will be setting up an Investment Day at one of our sites a little bit later in the year and we look forward to getting that into your calendars. So thank you very much and everyone have a great day.","Nick Alexos","Thank you.","Operator","And again, that does conclude our call. We would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7068":["DENTSPLY International (NASDAQ:XRAY) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 31, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Derek W. Leckow - Vice President of Investor Relations","Bret W.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Derek W. Leckow","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's Second Quarter 2014 Results. I'm joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","I hope you have a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides and information relating to the non-GAAP financials are available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.dentsply.com, under the heading, Events and Presentations.","I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and the U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's release also pertain to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties, and these should be considered in conjunction with the risks -- risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","With that, now I like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret W. Wise","Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I'd like to provide some insights on the market, how we see that by region and then our performance at a high level. And then I'll turn the call over to Chris -- or Chris and Jim for both operational comments and financial results.","Our market developments, we entered the year anticipating that the markets in both the U.S. and Europe should see some improvement driven by job growth in the U.S. and then a balanced improvement in economic conditions in Europe.","Through Q2, we have not really seen any meaningful improvement in either market. Rather it seems that both markets are stable, but in a slow-growth mode. So although we remain optimistic that these anticipated improvements will materialize, we're a bit more cautious about the market conditions than we were earlier in the year.","Specifically, on the market by region. First the U.S. or North America more broadly, I would describe the market as stable overall, but lacking any real growth momentum. The first quarter, this year, was slow due to office closures from severe weather on the East Coast. We do believe the market activity improved a bit in April, which may have reflected some pent-up demand, but then the market growth rate seemed to slow sequentially over the balance of the quarter, June in particular.","In Europe, things remain slow with some limited signs of growth. The U.S. market -- the U.K. market, for instance, continues to be a bright spot. Southern Europe appears more stable than it has been in recent years, and the rest of Europe is a mixed bag.","The Russian and Ukrainian markets continue to contract, although at slower rate than we saw in the first quarter, but probably still in the contracting in the high-single-digits or maybe even low-single-digit range.","In the Rest of World regions, the results are also mixed with most regions growing in the most recent quarter with the exception of Japan and Brazil that both declined on event-driven factors. In Japan, the market contracted due the VAT increase that was -- came effective April 1, which clearly moved buying activity into Q1 and out of Q2.","In Brazil, the market declined notably in June as the government instituted 5 additional national holiday days in the month of June in connection with the World Cup.","Moving to DENTSPLY's performance. Sales growth, x PM in the quarter was up 2.1%. However, internal growth was slightly negative by 0.6% on 1 less selling day than the prior year quarter, which was a disappointment to us. Constant currency growth was slightly better at plus 0.3% and currency added 1.8% in the current quarter.","U.S. internal growth was slightly positive at plus 0.2% against the challenging 6.2% comp last year with the growth, this year, driven primarily by our chair-side consumables that were up nicely. However, offsetting this lag continues to be negative. And in the non-dental segment, we had an industrial customer in source of product, which reduced U.S. growth by 80 basis points this quarter, and this impact will continue for the next couple of quarters. This particular product is a legacy product from an acquisition over a decade ago where volumes are now near 0 and it's non-core to our business.","If you look at the dental business, it was up roughly 1% internal in the U.S. So in U.S., we had some reasonable performances in certain product lines, but also some categories where we have some work to do.","In Europe, internal growth was generally consistent with what we've been seeing: It was down slightly, 1.3%. CIS, again, is a drag on our results and throughout the region. Rest of the region, I'd say growth is hard to find, spotty at best. x CIS, internal growth was down slightly in the region in the quarter.","In Rest of World, we are negative 0.6%, and that was heavily influenced by Japan. Overall, we had positive internal growth in the Pacific Rim, in Latin America, excluding Brazil, in Canada and in the Mideast and we are down double-digits in Japan.","Again, the increase in the VAT tax in Japan April 1 boosted our first quarter sales ahead of that tax, and I think we noted that on our first quarter call and is now depressing the second quarter result by a comparable amount. In total, Brazil and Japan took more than 350, probably closer -- more than 300 basis points out of the Rest of world, maybe as much as 350 basis points out of the Rest of World category for us.","I'll recall that we had positive internal growth of almost 9% in the first quarter in the Rest of World regions. So in this category, we take the noise out for Japan, I think the year-to-date numbers probably make more sense to look at which is 4% internal growth year-to-date. Also important to remember Rest of World category represents both developed and emerging markets for us.","Moving to earnings. As we've noted on the last couple of calls, we're very focused on improving the long-term efficiency of the business both at the product cost level and overhead -- and also the overhead structure. This quarter, we are faced with a very tough comparison from last year when operating margins were 19.2%, so we're very pleased to have exceeded that level in the current year, up slightly at 19.3%.","Adjusted EPS was an all-time quarterly record for us and was up 4.5%, again, against a tough comp last year. And in this sales environment, this earnings performance, we think is a pretty good achievement.","Year-to-date, sales were up 2.3%. x precious metals, operating margins are up 80 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 8.5%. So despite the lack of meaningful pickup in the growth, thus far, we remained comfortable for full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.47 to $2.55 per diluted share.","Lastly, before I turn the call over to Jim, as we've noted on prior calls, we are very focused on cash flow generation and improving the return on our investments. We have some pretty good results in those categories this quarter and year to date, and Chris is going to comment more on those in his remarks.","So let me turn the call over to Jim now for operational comments.","James G. Mosch","Thank you, Bret. I would like to provide an update on the status of previously launched products, products currently in launch, as well as the perspective on a few operational items. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review.","First, in our consumables business, we're pleased with the performance of Aquasil Ultra Cordless launched in Q4 of last year. This is a unique 1-step system for impression taking which, in most cases, eliminates the need for the traction cord, which is a time-consuming step for the dentist and often unpleasant process for the patient.","We had a very successful launch in Q4, which has continued into 2014. Today, we have over 2300 offices using Aquasil Ultra Cordless and anticipate increased adoption in coming quarters.","In Q1 of this year, DENTSPLY implants announced the launch of a new implant system, Astra Tech EV or evolution. The EV system has a new drilling protocol, which reduces clinical procedure time, a flexible clinically oriented surgical tray and also provides improved initial stability upon implant placement.","Early adoption has been excellent. And to date, EV already represents 20% of the previous Astra Tech implant system volume. However, one challenge is that we have seen some inventory liquidation by current customers in anticipation of the new system. We will be expanding the launch globally in the second half of 2014 and expect continued success with the EV system.","In our preventive business in Q2, we launched an extension of the market-leading Cavitron brand with the FITGRIP Cavitron insert. FITGRIP is an advancement on DENTSPLY Cavitron's ultrasonic inserts that adds a thick comfortable grip to lessen muscle load and pinch force for improved ergonomics. FITGRIP is been offered on the 9 most popular Cavitron inserts and has had great acceptance to date.","Within our endodontic business, we launched ProTaper Gold in North America at the end of the first quarter. Gold is an extension to our market-leading ProTaper endodontic power [ph] brand and utilizes a patented heat treatment process, which creates a gold hue. The process provides greater flexibility to negotiate canal anatomy and also significantly increases resistance to cyclical fatigue or file separation. We are early in the launch, but customer acceptance has gone well, and we now begin to roll the product out on a global basis.","Finally, one of the more innovative new products in the endodontic portfolio is true-shape [ph], a new endodontic 3D conforming instrument, which provides traditional root canal preparation while promoting dentin preservation. true-shape [ph] has a unique shape and a highly flexible design, which removes less dentin and maintains the integrity of the tooth structure. true-shape [ph] is the first product in our true platform, which will be a series of products focused on dentin preservation.","From an operational perspective, we announced the consolidation of our Sultan health care business based in Englewood, New Jersey to DENTSPLY professional division in York, Pennsylvania. This follows an earlier announcement of the consolidation of our RINN division in Elgin, Illinois to the professional division in Q1.","The purpose of these moves is to create a single preventive and infection control business, leverage operational R&D and SG&A resources and market the consolidated portfolio globally to our intracompany locations.","In the U.S., our Sultan sales force will remain independent, but the RINN x-ray position accessory products will be managed by our hygiene sales force, providing additional sales resources to support these brands.","Also in Q2, we completed the consolidation of our materialized dental operation, which provide implant treatment planning software and surgical guides based in Lugano [ph] , Belgium, which is been consolidated into Es Healthcare [ph] based in Hasselt, Belgium, which produces implant-retained bars and bridges. This follows the integration of various materialized dental country organizations into the respective DENTSPLY implants location. These moves are part of a broader strategy to create a fully integrated digital implant portfolio and are consistent with our efforts to increase asset utilization and improve return on those assets.","I'd now like to turn it over to Chris Clark.","Christopher T. Clark","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on our financial performance for the second quarter, including our efforts to improve operating margin, cash flow, and asset utilization.","For the second quarter, sales excluding precious metals grew 2.1% compared to prior year with constant currency growth of 30 basis points and favorable currency translation of 180 basis points.","Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 58.5% of sales, excluding precious metals, which represents an improvement of 10 basis points over the last year's second quarter.","I would note that currency moved against us in the gross profit line in the quarter by approximately 30 basis points, so our underlying gross profit rate performance on a constant currency basis was stronger than reported.","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, consistent with our SG&A rate in the second quarter of 2013.","Operating margin for the quarter improved by 10 basis points to 19.3% of sales, excluding precious metals on adjusted basis. That compares to 19.2% in the second quarter of last year. As we mentioned on our first quarter call, we knew that last year's strong operating margin rate would be a difficult baseline for us this quarter, so we're quite pleased with our operating margin performance.","I would add that currency was a headwind of the operating margin rate of -- by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter as well.","In addition, we invested approximately another 20 basis points of operating margin back into the business in cost to accelerate our operating margin improvement efforts moving forward.","Over the past 4 quarters, adjusted operating margins has improved by 60 basis points compared to the prior 12-month period. So we continue to be quite pleased with our progress in this area and believe that we're on track towards our objective of reaching a 20% adjusted operating margin rate in 2017. Our reported and operating tax rates for the second quarter were both 22.4%. As anticipated, tax represented a bit of a headwind in the quarter if the operating tax rate was 40 basis points, above our 22.0% rate in the second quarter last year.","Year-to-date, our operating tax rate of 22.5% is a 60-basis-point headwind the last year's rate and that's consistent with the guidance we provided for the year.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the second quarter was $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share. That compares to $87.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2013.","These results include a number of items, which we listed in the schedules in the release.","On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew to $99.7 million from $95.8 million in the prior-year quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4.6% to $0.69 per diluted share, and that compares to $0.66 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.","Despite the currency headwind to the operating margin rate in the quarter, the overall impact of currency on earnings for the quarter was neutral to slightly positive, less than $0.01 per share, due largely to the favorable impact of currency translation on both sales and earnings.","Year-to-date, currency remains a slight headwind to earnings. And while rates are pretty volatile presently, at current rates, we would anticipate the currency impact on earnings over the next 2 quarters to be minimal.","Moving on to cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $155.7 million, which represents a 60% increase over last year's $97 million. This represents a record quarterly cash flow for the second quarter for the company. For the first half of 2014, our operating cash flow 22.2 -- I'm sorry, $220.2 million represents an increase of $88.4 million over prior year, which is a 67% increase.","We continue to focus on driving better cash management and are benefiting in particular from some of the tax strategies implemented, as well as lower investments in working capital compared to prior year.","With respect to working capital, inventories now stand at 123 days, which is up 3 days compared to March and up 7 days compared to prior year. As we mentioned on several previous earnings calls, we have strategically increased inventory in a few businesses as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operational changes.","We expect inventory to now begin to decrease in the back half of 2014 and through 2015 as we gradually return to more normal levels. Accounts receivable days were 59 days at the end of June. That's down 2 days from March and flat to prior-year June. Capital expenditures were $24 million in the quarter, while depreciation was $21 million and amortization was $13 million.","Net debt improved by over $112 million in the quarter. And our net debt-to-capitalization ratio now stands at 33.5% compared to 39.3% a year ago, and 51.3% right after the Astra Tech acquisition.","In the quarter, the company also repurchased just under 300,000 shares of common stock, bringing our year-to-date total to just under 1.2 million shares.","In terms of our capital deployment approach, I want to reiterate that our attempt is to continue to support repaying debt while also balancing uses of free cash flow to support reinvesting in the business, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. So really a balanced approach.","Finally, as Bret stated, based on our first half results, as well as our current view of the relevant market factors, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. This reflects a number of pluses and minuses that we've outlined this morning, including a somewhat tempered view of market conditions as Bret noted, as well as more challenging prior-year earnings growth comparison in the second half than what we ran against in the first half.","We are also factoring in the momentum, we believe, we are creating relative to our efforts to improve operating efficiency and to drive better leverage of our cost and asset basis.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support, and we'd now be glad to answer any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jeff Johnson at Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bret, just wanted to start with you on some of your market comments, and I think the way you're seeing the market is very similar to what we've been seeing the market here in our checks and survey work over the last month or 2 of maybe a little bit of incremental softness in June and what have you. But as the GDP number comes out 4% for the second quarter. Employment seems to be picking up, maybe you've been seeing some wage inflation here picking up a little bit, which would be helpful probably from a spending standpoint. What do you think is causing kind of this sluggishness at this dental market level versus what seems to be at least in the domestic, trends a little bit strengthening on the macro side?","Bret W. Wise","Thanks, Jeff. And that is an important question. We did see the GDP report yesterday, which was quite encouraging for the second quarter. And obviously, dental's a trailing indicators, so if we see strong GDP growth, generally speaking, history would tell us that dental will be picked up on a couple of quarter lag behind that. Year-to-date GDP is not so great. It's only up 0.9%. I think through the middle of the year, and obviously, was depressed in the first quarter for all the comments -- the reasons we know about weather, et cetera. But seemed to pick up in the second quarter. And if so, then again, I would expect to see dental improve. It just hasn't improved yet. On the employment numbers, at the surface, those are also very encouraging. I mean, we saw 288,000 jobs added in June. When you peel that back one layer, the truth is they added -- we added about 800,000 part-time jobs and lost 500,000 full-time jobs. And, of course, the full-time jobs generally have benefits and the part-time don't. So I think we have to watch those numbers a little more carefully and understand what the nature of the jobs are. And generally speaking, if you track white-collar job growth, it tracks pretty close to dental growth. And so that's the factor we're trying to watch. So I didn't mean to be entirely negative on the growth outlook, because we still believe -- or I still believe that the dental markets are going to start pickup particularly if we see some economic growth like we saw in the second quarter. If that continues to play out, I think we'll see an improvement over the next couple of quarters.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, understood. Helpful. And then as I look at the organic growth number this quarter, I compared to maybe one of your larger competitors on the manufacture side. They don't give exact details, but it sounds like their consumables business is up low-single-digits in the quarter. We haven't heard yet from the distributors. My sense is their consumables numbers might be just to touch stronger than your organic growth was not by much, but maybe some. Talk to me maybe a little bit about your share and kind of how you feel like DENTSPLY is competing here against some of the others out there?","Bret W. Wise","Okay. Well, the data points we have so far is one competitor came out with 2% dental, but said equipment was the growth factor and consumables were less than that. I don't think they gave the exact number, but I implied it was flat. Their consumable number must have been flat based on what they said. We have the industry data through May, which would tell us and chair-side consumables were actually gaining share. And we do have a drag from lab. We've got -- that's a business that's under repair, we have work to do there. If asked directly, are we losing share in lab, I'd say, yes. The rest of businesses are mixed. We have some very good performance in the everyday dentistry products, some very good product launches. Jim mentioned a few of those. I think we have some upside there. In the specialty business, implants in particular, I think could be an upside with this new product launch. We have to watch that closely. And so overall, I think it is a mixed bag. I don't think we're beating the market by a lot, but I don't think the market is really robust right now either. And the data points you mentioned we need. We need to see what the dealer report for Q2, and then we'll know more firmly what the market is.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. Understood. Last question and then just, Jim, any chance you could quantify some of the liquidation you were seeing -- you mentioned on the inventory side with the EV launch? Where is that happening in U.S. versus Europe? If you could quantify it at all, maybe what that implicate might imply for the second half of the year, if some channel inventory has to get rebuilt, things like that?","James G. Mosch","Yes, Jeff. So I think the -- what we've seen is that -- the 2 markets we went into, we went into the United States, Canada and then select European markets. And one of the phenomena as you see when you launch a new implant system is obviously the customer has to go a transition process. They are -- they need to buy a new surgical kit. They're being judicious about their implant purchases based on what they think they might place going forward. Where they are fairly aggressive is in their abutment stocks. And they recognize that they're not going to be producing these -- they are not going to be placing these going forward. So they significantly reduce their abutment inventories, and we've definitely seen that. I think one of the other -- I think maybe it's a positive phenomena, which is that transition to a new implant system is not insignificant for a surgeon. And we would expect that if 4 to -- if we contact 10 oral surgeons, 4 out of 5 would want to make a conversion immediately. And in fact, I think the success of this system is it's more or like 8 out of 10. So that's kind of put some additional pressure on both the capacity standpoint, as well as the inventory impact. We have addressed that issue, and we are prepared for full launch in the back half of the year, particularly in the United States. And we expect growth from that.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Nathan Rich on for Bob, today. First, I just wanted to dive into little bit more detail on what you saw in Europe in the quarter. I think internal growth was pretty consistent with the first quarter. But was wondering if you could comment on Western Europe specifically and how that perform relative to the first quarter? And just any update on your expectation for what you expect in Europe in the back half of the year?","Bret W. Wise","Okay. Yes, this is Bret. Like I mentioned, we are down 1.3%, I think, in Europe in the quarter, which is kind of, as you know, is kind of consistent what we would have been seeing. CIF continued to be a drag there, but it was a little bit less than a drag than it was in the first quarter. For Western Europe, we were still down slightly, less than 1%, obviously, in the quarter and it's a mixed bag. We've got some countries in the south that are growing, some that are stable, some that are slightly contracting. Even in North is a mixed bag at this point. U.K. is a growth market. And as I mentioned it looks good, whereas France was pretty weak, et cetera. Germany was kind of flattish. So I don't really have a lot more colors on that other than to say overall, the trends don't seem to be changing much. They seem to be consistent with what we've seen before. There are moves in individual countries, but overall the region is performing about as it has been.","Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then also just -- very impressive SG&A control in the quarter. And it sounds like you're planning to kind of accelerate your efforts in terms of achieving your long-term operating margin goal. I'm just wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on how you're able to control expenses in the quarter. Maybe any specific initiatives that you're exceeding plan on? And then how should we think about how the cost savings ramp not only in the back half of this year but also into 2015?","Bret W. Wise","Okay. I'm going to take a stab at that. And then Chris may have some additional comments. One of the things we commented on is that we've been building inventory ahead of some operational initiatives. Jim commented on several of those in his prepared remarks today. Those are evidence of the types of moves that we have been making and will be making. I don't know that I would describe it as that we're accelerating the efforts. The plan we have is a very balanced plan, well-thought-out plan. And the idea is to reduce the fixed cost structure burden on the businesses, so they have more variable spent to invest in growth, and that's what we've been doing. So like I said, it's not that we are going faster than we were thinking we are going to go. We are going at about the rate we thought we would go, and this is a multiyear long-term initiative to improve the profitability of the business and the return on assets. Now, Chris, I said a lot. Is there anything you'd like to add to that?","Christopher T. Clark","No, I think that's accurate. I mean, again, I think you'll continue to see us provide some insights in terms of the specific actions and strategies as we take them. And obviously, we'll continue to provide those insights on the call. And I would say that this quarter is pretty consistent with what we've been doing. We're very focused on driving SG&A leverage. We're very focused on driving better asset utilization across our plants, having our teams work far more closely together. And that drives the benefits that we're seeing. So again, we're pleased with the performance, but it's -- we'll continue to execute those strategies and as we have larger events or notable events our strategies that are central to that, we'll provide comments on those as we implement those.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of businesses that we didn't spend much time on in the prepared remarks. I'm wondering if you could help us out a bit on, number one is implants. Could you give us a sense of how the growth there tracked? Any perspective on the market and regional trends would be really helpful.","Bret W. Wise","Yes, Steve. As far as our implant business, growth in Q2 was up low-single-digits. On a constant currency basis, we were slightly negative. We continue to see growth in North America. Europe did contract, and Rest of World was up in spite of a pretty big pullback in Japan that we saw in Q2. I did mention in my prepared remarks we have seen some impacts as it relates to the inventory liquidation. That was particularly true in North America. We've only had 2 companies report thus far, they're between minus 1%, plus 2%. We feel we're in that range, and quite frankly, our focus now is really on the launch of EV which we think will support as [ph] well in second half of the year. Our digital business continues to perform very well.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I am sorry if I missed, but did you attempt to quantify the liquidation impact on the quarter? It sounds like relative to the market, order of magnitude may be a point?","Bret W. Wise","That's kind of difficult to do. I mean, it's across a lot of customers. So your -- we don't have obviously access to inventory at the customer levels. So it's really difficult to measure that magnitude.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then I wonder if you could spend a minute on the health care business, the non-dental piece of the business? As I reflect that on your comments, Bret, about the performance of dental in North America. I was hoping that you could give us a little color there to help us put together the rest of the puzzle for the full U.S. line?","Bret W. Wise","Just for clarity, Steve, you want more color on the non-dental piece or on the dental piece?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The non-dental, sorry.","Bret W. Wise","Okay, non-dental is, for us, is made up of our Wellspect HealthCare business, which performed quite well in the quarter. But also some, let's call them legacy industrial lines dating back -- in this case, dating back anywhere from 15 to 30 years. Acquisitions, we've done over very long period of time. There's not a wide variety of products in that category anymore. Those kind of have slowly been faced out of the portfolio, but in this case, we had one particular product that was produced, generally speaking, for just one customer as a raw material for them to go into their product line. And it hadn't been in a product line that had been growing or investing in. But that customer decided to in source that product line. And so it's basically gone now from our portfolio or will be phased out over the next couple of quarters. So I -- this is a non-core issue. I don't think we need to spend a lot of time on it. But this is just one of those small items that were sitting in the portfolio that now is going to be gone.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And the legacy Astra health care business?","Bret W. Wise","The legacy Astra health care business is the Wellspect business that I mentioned that performed very well during the quarter and continues to be a really bright spot in the portfolio, so it's a business we like a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Erin Wilson with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On capital deployment, do you anticipate any sort of change in strategy on the M&A front specifically in light of Nobel [ph] on the block more recently? And broadly speaking, I guess 5 years down the road, what businesses really make sense for you?","Bret W. Wise","Thanks Erin. I am going to take a stab at that and Chris may have some color to add as well. Our strategy is to find technologies or companies or brands that improves the portfolio of the company and make those investments. We are a, I would call us an aggressive acquirer where there is value to be had from strategic standpoint. Most likely in dental, that's going to be smaller tuck-under acquisitions. We've made a lifetime career out of doing small tuck-under acquisitions, we think we're pretty good at it. Timing is always a problem or always an issue, because these are primarily health companies, et cetera. With respect to larger targets, I don't want to comment on any one target in particular, but as you know, we've considered larger targets before and actually have transacted larger targets for the right strategic reasons. From a capital deployment strategy standpoint, our first priority is to reinvest in the business and innovation in sales and marketing, clinical education, all those sort of things, which can grow the business organically. Our second priority is the balance between continued debt reduction, which you've seen is to recently pretty well I think. Share buyback -- or acquisitions where we can do it would be the next priority followed by share buybacks and dividends. I don't think those priorities have changed. We'd still probably put acquisitions at a higher priority than share buybacks. Although we're committed to holding the share count neutral or decreasing it each year as we move forward. So particularly given where our debt structured is today. Chris, do you have.","Christopher T. Clark","Nothing. You hit it.","Bret W. Wise","Okay. So that's where we stand on capital deployment strategy.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And how much would you say new product launches are contributing year-to-date? And should we expect more meaningful contribution from new product launches in 2015?","Bret W. Wise","New product launches are, as they always do, contribute. There's always amount of cannibalization because we're generally launching, for the most part, in categories where we already have some product lines. We are just trying to improve the practice of dentistry in that product line. I don't have a great -- I don't really have a good quantified estimate for you for the impact on new product launches. We did have several key products that launched in the last 6 months. Jim noted those. We have a pipeline going forward that looks like it could be a little heavy on the back half than it was in the first half. But product launches and new products is a fundamental part of our strategy that's important to the internal growth to continue growth of the company. Sorry I don't have a better quantification for you at this time. But I just don't have that at hand.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Matt Baxo [ph] with William Blair.","Unknown Analyst","So, I guess my question is to get your 20% operating margin by 2017, how much is that predicated on the market actually growing? Or can you basically get there from current growth rates on the top line?","Bret W. Wise","Well, that's a tough question. It will be a lot easier if the market's growing, that's for sure. The plans that we've laid out would allow us to get to that number, not totally irrespective of market growth, but including a period when market growth was lower than historical norms. So I don't want to say we can get every 0 market growth, because I think that would be tough. But the plan is laid out for -- as such that we can get there without the market returning to the 4% to 6% growth the we had enjoyed pre-recession, and the fundamentals of the plan are that it would allow the business to really enjoy some prosperity if in fact -- with these actions if in fact the market did return to that level.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And also I know you guys have mentioned earlier in the year that you were closing a few plants to increase utilization capacity and stuff like that. How far along are you in that process and when do you expect that to end?","Bret W. Wise","That's a long-term program. The comments that Jim made today were the ones that we've taken, thus far. I think there are 3 actions that's been taken so thus far. There'll be more of that, because we need to do some consolidation. We need to increase capacity utilization and become more effective on the cost side. But that's going to be a multiyear program where we improve efficiency of the business. It's not a quick rifle shot.","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, Matt [ph] , it's Chris. I think again, the same comment earlier holds as we take those actions, we'll provide perspective on those obviously as we move forward. And the perspective of that point as well in terms of what we should need for us.","Operator","And next we'll go to Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe first one, Bret. We've been speaking with the threat of value or generic implants for a while and it's always tough to give numbers but one of your competitors at a recent Analyst Day gave out sort of high, maybe a mid-teen growth rate for their value offerings. We've seen some of your premium competitors sort of repositioned themselves to at least have a hand in value from an equity state [ph] . Can you talk big picture how you see the implant market is sort of shaping out of the high-end and to the low end of the next 2 to 3 years. And do you guys need to do anything to reposition yourselves to capture growth?","Bret W. Wise","John, a couple comments. There certainly is a lower price, or I think you used the word, \"generic\" implant market. It's not our focus. We're more focused on advancing the science. This is a very risky part of dentistry. I just actually had a dental implant done 2 months ago, and I now know personally that it's quite an event. So our focus is on advancing the science and advancing the practice of dentistry. We're just launching a new premium implant that comes at a price premium. The market acceptance has been tremendous and so we can see that the clinicians and the patients are willing to pay for value. On the other hand, we don't dismiss the fact that there is this lower-priced generic segment. We think it's much -- could be as much as $1.5 billion market now. So it's not one to be dismissed. We're tracking very closely what's happening in that market. We think that profitability is generally low for most companies that are participating in that segment. Not all companies, but most companies. We've tracked over the last, I think, 3 or 4 years, 28 companies in that market, 19 of which have now gone out of business. And so there's been others that have come into that market. So we are very in-tuned to what's happening in that part of the market. We did make a small investment 4, 5 years ago in a low-cost implant player in South Korea. We're considering our options there. But we have nothing really else to communicate to the market at this time.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful and maybe just a follow up. In terms of who may or may not for sale there, can you speak to may be, Bret, how it could impact you guys if you were to go to this rumored sale to a player that's currently one of the top 1, 3, 4, excuse me, #1 players out there or private equity? I guess where I'm going with this is, when you guys did Astra Tech, do you see a chance -- a greater chance to pick up share as one of the leaders were to make a move for the company that's for sale versus it just going to private equity?","Bret W. Wise","That's hard to answer obviously, because we're speculating on who could be involved in any single transaction. I think that acquisitions cause disruption and disruption sometimes creates opportunity for competitors. And we just went through that. So we're watching it very closely. We do know that out of the top 5, 2 of those are merging now or have plans to merge, which will cause some disruption. And the latest rumors about another top player in the market could further cause disruption. But it's hard for me to speculate about the nature of the disruption and how we would react without knowing exactly what transactions were going to transpire.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And lastly for me real quick. Chris, I think when we started off the year, you mentioned FX headwinds of about $0.04. Is that where we are? Are we closer to $0.02 or $0.03? Can you just -- I guess clean that up as we sit here today?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, I mean, obviously we're bouncing around the fair amount, so we're going to -- it's tough to pin it down to specific number. The building blocks we give you was we were about $0.02 negative in the first quarter. We're neutral to slightly positive. You should think less than $0.01 or share in the second quarter. And if rates stay where they are right now, then it's going to be pretty well neutral for the last 2 quarters, pretty much a nonevent. Now that said, there's a lot of pluses and minuses within that. We'll get some help from the euro, the second-tier basket of currencies are still really -- they're down 7.5% compared to a year ago on a year-to-date basis. So again, there's a lot of movement at this stage of the game. But if you take a look at a snapshot, it would be the best perspective I could give you.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll go next to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Bret, could you speak to the endo and ortho businesses? Any changes or developments that you've seen in those markets globally or regionally?","Bret W. Wise","Sure, Brandon. First on ortho, I think we've commented on that, please from our perspective, that's probably the most competitive market in dentistry right now. I mean, there's excess capacity that's been added that market. There's price pressure. We're still focused on technology and bringing new products to market, and recovering from the product supply outage that we had a couple of years ago. So there's a lot of pressure in that market and ortho is not a growth market for us at this point. Endo, on the other hand, we're a leader in endo in technology. We're -- we continue to grow nicely in that category. We're bringing new products to market. Jim commented on some of those this morning. So endo remains a bright spot for us in our overall portfolio.","Brandon Couillard","Chris, on the cash flow front, any chance you could quantify the magnitude of the inventory opportunity or wind down in the back half of the year? And should we think absolute inventory levels being declining on a dollar basis in '15?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. So again, I think, Brandon, we -- the word I'd give you would be \"gradual\" in terms of the movement. I'm not going to put an inventory target out there for this fiscal year for us. But of course, I would say that I would be disappointed if we don't continue to gradually improve here. There may be a quarter up or quarter down. But in short, we should be gradually moving this. So as we look at our inventory levels right now, 123 days compared to historically where we were if you go back in 2, 3 years ago. The fact is, they're up a number of days. And again our objective is to gradually bring these down. We expect to make some progress by yearend. We expect to make more progress through '15. And then obviously, we think we'd probably still have some room to grow after that. And again, this is a longer term focus area. There's -- we'll be burning down some of the transitional stock that we built. But we think that beyond that, there's some movements we can take, actions we can take to continue to improve, frankly, the overall inventory efficiency and asset efficiency in the inventory line for us.","Bret W. Wise","And Brandon, this is Bret. I'd just add to that, that there's lot -- I would say more focus on this issue internally than we've had in sometime in a number of years. So this is an area that, strategically, we want to get at.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Derek W. Leckow","Okay. Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. If you have more questions, I'm available today for follow-up. Goodbye.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"7251":["DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. (NASDAQ:XRAY) Q1 2017 Earnings Call May  9, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Jeffrey T.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slides two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona. Jeff?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Derek. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Also joining us on the call today Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Joshua Zable, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that our CFO, Uli Michel, will not be on the call today to attend to a medical issue. We look forward to his return next time.","Turning to the call, our results this quarter were far from stellar, but I am pleased that we are able to deliver on critical strategic objectives. We are now better positioned to accelerate our short and long-term growth. In March, at the International Dental Show, Dentsply Sirona set the standard for what it means to be a total solutions provider for the dental professionals and labs.","We unveiled how an enabling technologies integrated with procedural solutions provide better clinical outcomes. We also reinforced our position as the innovator in the industry. At the Show, we launched 50 new products which will drive our growth for years to come. This morning we also announced our plans to expand distribution in the U.S. market. We are excited to expand our partnership with Patterson, with a new long-term U.S. distribution agreement that will help drive adoption of our digital technologies and solutions for years to come.","Together, over 20 years, we've created CEREC as the standard for single-visit dentistry in the U.S. We are also excited to expand our relationship with Henry Schein in North America, with a new three-year agreement beginning in September, under which Henry Schein will begin selling our leading equipment brand in the U.S. This should benefit all of our product lines, including Schick Sensors, Treatment Centers, extraoral imaging, and of course, CEREC as well.","Both Patterson and Henry Schein will be critical drivers in accelerating adoption of our digital technology and our unique integrated solutions. We firmly believe our now new go-to-market strategy in the U.S. will accelerate our growth for years to come. I will discuss this in more detail later. Our merger-related initiatives are on track. We will ramp cost and revenue synergy activities throughout the year, driving top and bottom-line growth for 2017.","Turning to the quarterly results. First quarter internal sales declined 4.7%, driven by decline in technology. Consumables and Healthcare grew 2.4% this quarter. Our Consumables business grew in each of our three regions. Technologies declined by approximately 13% or $57 million. Growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately $40 million as a result of quarter-over-quarter changes in net equipment inventory levels at certain distributors in North America and Europe, related to the transition in distribution strategy in North America. The remaining decline is attributable to weaker retail performance. The largest contributor being the U.S., where the transition to our go-to-market is having an impact.","Turning to geographies. This quarter Europe led the way with 2.2% internal growth. Consumables growth offset, no growth in Technologies. Revenue synergies are creating momentum for us in Europe. Based on our assessment, our Consumables outpaced the market for the second quarter in a row. Technologies in Europe was essentially flat. We were able to compensate for the unfavorable impact of a $5 million change in net equipment inventory and the slowdown ahead of the International Dental Show.","As a reminder, in Europe and in Germany in particular, many of our customers wait for the Show to purchase new equipment. We are pleased to report that we had a record order intake at the event. Our success at the Show across both Technologies and Consumables highlighted the power of our merger. Rest of World was down 5.2% on top of last year's 7.5% growth. $5 million or 220 basis points of the decline in Q1 was driven by a change in net equipment inventory level at a distributor in Kennedy associated with the transition of our distribution strategy in North America.","The remainder of the decline was driven by the Technologies segment, where we had very strong growth in certain countries last year. In Q4 2016, the region grew almost 10%, driven by Technologies. We continue to expect the Rest of World region to be our fastest growing region this year. U.S. sales were down 11% driven by decline in Technologies, as I already discussed, the primary driver of the decline was due to equipment inventory changes and to a lesser extent distributor retail performance.","Our North American Consumables business grew low single digits. We were pleased to see the business accelerate sequentially from the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that North America market is stable and showing modest improvement. During the quarter, we continue to do our active capital allocation program; we bought back another $85 million of stock and announced a small, but strategically important acquisition, using our strong and flexible balance sheet will continue to be a lever for us to increase shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Josh who will review our fourth quarter financials and outlook.","Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. In the first quarter, our reported revenue increased $127.9 million to $900.5 million, up 16.6%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses excluding precious metals, declined 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth declined 4.7% excluding a 250 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions.","As Jeff already explained, overall sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $40 million or 430 basis points as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels at distributors related to our transition and distribution strategy in North America.","Foreign exchange movements were a headwind of revenue of 130 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016. Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together.","U.S. GAAP gross profit was $492 million, up $73.1 million or 17.5% from $418.9 million in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of sales excluding precious metal content, decreased by 20 basis points to 55.3% from 55.5% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 360 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step up amortization and other merger-related items as compared to 510 basis points last year.","On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 58.9%, down 170 basis points for the quarter. The majority of the decline is associated with a lower gross profit rate on equipment associated with the timing of the merger. Last year's gross margin was favorably impacted by the consolidation of only the strongest sales month for the quarter for Sirona, with a more favorable product mix. Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $404.7 million, up $62.6 million or 18.3% versus last year. This equates to 45.5% of sales, excluding precious metals, 20 basis points above prior year.","Reductions in business combination related costs, fair value adjustments as well as amortization of purchased intangible assets and similar items benefited the rate by 330 basis points. These benefits largely compensated for rate increases driven by the lack of revenues associated with equipment inventory reductions, biennial trade shows and other selling events as well as the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange.","Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $377.3 million or 42.3% of sales excluding precious metals, representing an increase of 390 basis points. This year, IDS and selling events added approximately 135 basis points and lower sales from dealer inventory reduction also impacted the rate by approximately 180 basis points. FX and acquisitions cost us about 50 basis points. The rest of the increase is the balance of investments in selling and R&D, offsetting savings in G&A.","Restructuring expenses were $3.1 million, down from $4.1 million last year. In total, GAAP operating income was $84.2 million, up $11.5 million or 15.8% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 16.6%, down 560 basis points compared to 22.2% last year.","As discussed, the gross profit margin rate was down 170 basis points with favorable impacts from the timing of the merger last year and unfavorable impacts of from equipment distributor inventory reductions this year. In addition to this headwind, operating margins for the current year were impacted by higher operating expense rates by 390 basis points as discussed a moment ago. Net interest and other income and expense for the first quarter increased by $2.3 million compared to the prior year.","For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $16.9 million versus a $57.9 million benefit last year. As a reminder, last year's first quarter taxes benefited from a $76.1 million valuation allowance release related to the merger. This year we have $6.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation. Per our existing policy, we exclude discrete tax items from adjusted earnings.","On an annual basis, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 19.2% compared to 23% in the first quarter last year and 20.8% for the full year 2016. Our lower tax rate is a benefit resulting from the complementary tax attributes of the merged companies.","Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $59.8 million, down 52.1% from the prior year. First quarter diluted GAAP EPS was $0.26 compared to $0.70 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income declined 7.1% to $113.7 million. The decline in net income reflects the lack of revenue largely associated with changes in net equipment inventory levels at certain distributors.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 compared to $0.69 last year. The $0.20 decline in adjusted EPS was driven by the effects of the higher share count, partially offset by additional two months of Sirona and the effects of the distributor equipment inventory changes. In addition, FX created a $0.03 headwind. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release.","The year-over-year comparisons in the cash flow statement are less meaningful this quarter, given the timing of the closing of the merger in February last year. I will discuss elements of the cash flow statement this year highlighting the key drivers. Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $82.5 million. Cash used in investing activities is $41.1 million. Capital expenditures were $31.1 million for the quarter. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million. During the quarter, we paid $78 million for share repurchases and paid $18 million in dividends.","Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.80 to $2.90. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: Constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%. This includes approximately 150 basis points of net benefit from acquisitions' divestitures, implying internal growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.95 billion to $4.03 billion. We now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 19.2%.","Our EPS range implies a full year diluted share count of approximately 231 million to 233 million shares versus 222 million in 2016. This reflects approximately $0.09 of headwind at the midpoint and is simply a function of the timing of the merger. We still anticipate FX headwinds of $0.08 to $0.10 for 2017. As we explained on our last call, we will continue to experience headwinds associated with inventory reductions. For now, the inventory reductions are expected to continue to negatively impact our net sales into the third quarter of 2017 by approximately $50 million to $60 million in total.","As other market channels are brought online in the third and fourth quarter, sales through these channels could offset the majority of the mentioned inventory reduction resulting in a net of $10 million to $20 million unfavorable impact on our revenues for the remainder of the year. We expect this to translate into a much stronger back half of the year. As always, I suggest our investors evaluate our business on an annual basis as our quarterly progression can vary.","I will now turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Josh. As the dental market grows, Dentsply Sirona will truly be the partner of choice to deliver better, safer, faster dental care to meet the growing demand. Dentistry's importance is being recognized as a critical driver of overall health. In the past quarter alone, multiple studies have confirmed the importance of oral health. At the American Stroke Association's international conference, research was presented linking periodontal disease as a potential cause for stroke. A large study in Japan found that patients who retain more of their natural teeth were less likely to develop dementia.","In March, the Journal of The American Medical Association published an article highlighting data that showed that poor oral health can trigger autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. In both developed and developing markets, a heightened awareness about the importance of dental care is driving increased demand. Coupled with sustainable demographic trends, our industry has a long runway of growth ahead.","A significant part of our market is private pay as other health care providers brace for health care reform, our customers can focus on how to best serve their patients. At the IDS, it was clear that dental professionals want to treat their patients with best-in-class integrated solutions. Dentsply Sirona can best support the individual practitioners and group practices, with efficient and effective end-to-end workflows.","As many of you know, group practices are the fastest-growing segment of the market, and an area where Dentsply Sirona is significantly underpenetrated, particularly in terms of equipment. One of the rationales per the merger was that by coming together, we could offer groups an unmatched value proposition. With the broadest clinical education platform, end-to-end solutions that create more efficient practices and technologies that greatly enhance the patient experience, Dentsply Sirona is an ideal manufacturer partner for the groups.","In Q1, we expanded our relationship with Aspen Dental, which has 600 practices across 36 states. Clinicians in Aspen branded practices made the decision to implement our new Nupro Freedom Cordless Prophy hand piece throughout their offices. They were one of the first groups to embrace the advantages of the product, which includes one-of-a-kind infection prevention, reduced noise and exceptional ergonomics for hygienists.","We have a solid foundation with group practices, but we have a significant opportunity to bring more value to current customers and to bring on new ones. We will continue to focus more resources there and develop products that can better support our customers and differentiate us from the competition. This fact was evident at the International Dental Show in March. We launched 50 new products and solutions at the Show itself. At the Show, we unveiled our new root to crown solution. As the market leader in imaging and doing restorative products, Dentsply Sirona can now provide an end-to-end integrated solution for root canals. This makes treatment better, safer and faster. Dental professionals understand that enabling technologies are the key to providing integrated procedural solutions.","At the IDS, it was clear that digital dentistry is happening today and Dentsply Sirona is best positioned to accelerate the benefits for this megatrend. 3D imaging and single-visit dentistry are both at the tipping point. With the launch of our low-dose mode for the Orthophos SL, we are another step closer to making 3D imaging a standard of care. With lower radiation levels, we've made using our 3D imaging safer, while still offering best-in-class X-ray quality.","For the first time at the IDS, we announced opening up CEREC systems to enable export of our STL files. Without compromising the integrity of our unmatched Chairside system, opening up the Omnicam will accelerate adoption of our product for digital impressions. Many digital labs have gone from being opponents to digital to supporters. Digital impressions makes labs workflows more accurate and efficient helps them better serve their customers. By opening up the system, we have facilitated better coordination between dental labs and individual practitioners.","Now as dentists go from impression materials to digital, our Omnicam represents the best choice in terms of quality, ease-of-use and effectiveness for both dentists and labs alike and we still have the number one selling impression material. Awareness and acceptance is not only rising in professional community, but among consumers as well. Single-visit dentistry is differentiating dentists to their patients who are beginning to ask for CEREC by name.","In May, we launched a direct-to-consumer promotional campaign in conjunction with 1-800-Dentist to celebrate Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales to raise the profile of our technology and educate potential U.S. patients on the benefits of CEREC and single-visit dentistry. We also ramped up our efforts to reach different demographics by appearing on well-known stations such as MSNBC, CNN and ESPN.","The other critical component to accelerating adoption is the partnership of our distributors. This morning we announced a new go-to-market strategy in the U.S. The U.S. market is the largest in the world and critical to our long-term success. In September, Patterson and Henry Schein, the two largest distributors in the country, will have access to our full distribution product line.","Our consumables have been part of both Henry Schein and Patterson since the early days of dental distribution in the U.S. We have a unique and important relationship with Patterson, who has been an exclusive partner selling equipment and technology in the United States. Together we have been a driving force in the adoption of digital technologies and our new agreement ensures that our companies continue driving penetration of digital technologies and solutions in this important market.","We're also excited to expand our relationship with Henry Schein and are confident that adding our equipment lines to their sales and service infrastructure should be complementary, as they already know us and our products well. Schein can leverage the knowledge and success they've had selling our technology in Europe. With both distributors carrying our full distributed product line, we will expand our reach into the U. S. market. Awareness about the digital and single-visit dentistry will increase and expand the market.","With CEREC only 17% penetrated and 3D even less, there is significant room for growth with both Patterson and Henry Schein. Equally important with both Patterson and Henry Schein, carrying our full distributed product lines, we will be able to reach the majority of U.S. dental professionals with our end-to-end solutions. As they adopt our full solutions, we will grow faster. As our installed base increases, we will have even more opportunities to cross-sell our product portfolio.","A critical component to cross-selling is also integrating our products. Our leading Treatment Centers are now integrated with our endodontic and implantology systems, further differentiating our products. Dentsply Sirona Treatment Centers are truly the centerpiece of the dental office and critical hubs in our ecosystem. We had another record quarter before the IDS in Q1.","We also continue to have success selling our Celtra Duo Blocks and other CEREC consumables to new users of our technology. This is rapidly growing multi-hundred million dollar market. This synergy opportunity is significant. We are ramping sales rapidly. As our one global team works hand-in-hand, we are seeing clear benefits. Where our commercial strategies are critical to driving growth, innovation will remain the hallmark of Dentsply Sirona.","At the American Association of Endodontic's annual meeting, we launched our new CEREC Ortho 1.2 software and the new self-ligating bracket system In-Ovation X. This is the first meaningful innovation of self-ligating brackets in many years and reduces both treatment time and professional chair time compared to the current standard of care in this category.","Our lab business has a slew of new products in the market. Materials like Celtra Press and Cercon xt are driving momentum in the marketplace. We continue to invest in research and development as well as our sales and service infrastructure. With over 4,000 sales and service professionals around the globe, our reach is unparalleled in the industry. Our merger is enabling us to make these investments as we generate cost savings. We have many multiple reorganizations and country formation projects in process. Our cost synergies programs remain on track and will ramp into 2018.","Top-line growth remains at the forefront of our priorities and strategies, but we will also remain committed to driving leverage through our P&L and driving increased profitability. We anticipate earnings growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Finally, our capital allocation continues to be a key component of our strategy. With our strong balance sheet, we remain focused on our pipeline of deals and a disciplined approach. In addition to acquisitions, we intend to consistently return capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona.","We are pleased to announce our new agreements with Henry Schein and with Patterson today. We are truly excited about the possibility of growing together. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees. Integrating two companies can be difficult and many have been working tirelessly to make Dentsply Sirona a success. Their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients is inspiring.","We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We will now take our first question from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Good morning.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","I guess, Jeff, starting with the Henry Schein deal. Can you speak to the importance or the somewhat earlier start date, being September 1? I was previously under the impression that the Patterson exclusivity would run through the end of September. And is there any relevancy to the three-year period? And I guess, part two, maybe for Joshua. You seem to point to a slightly or a wider band for the inventory de-stocking headwind this year, $50 million to $60 million versus the prior $50 million. Can you just elaborate on the shift there?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Brandon; important question. Of course, we're celebrating today the announcement of Henry Schein. As we stated on our call in February, the transition to opening up distribution has its challenges. And we made it clear that we were changing our go-to-market and we felt, as an organization and working with Patterson, that this was the right time to be able to announce this.","This is a significant decision for us. We also felt, by doing this now, we were able to stay focused on our exclusivity with Patterson through the summer, but be able to bring Schein on for our September and our DS World, as we move forward to the back half of our year. The significance of the three years is just an initial term for us. We expect to be doing business with our full distributed lines with Schein for years to come. We're very excited about how our teams have worked together, as we've seen the success in Europe and what we've been able to do on the distributed consumable side with Henry Schein.","The time is now, ever since it was announced that we would be changing our strategy and opening it up, and to get the clarity in the marketplace were exactly what we're doing. In the absence of clarity, we have issues with our customers, we have issues with distribution reps, we have rumors, and frankly, we have our own people wondering what's going to happen. Now we have that clarity about how we're moving forward and this is important.","And certainly, we have confidence in our long-standing relationship with Patterson on the technology side, certainly, it's been 20 years of exclusive with CEREC which is very special to us. Henry Schein has had and continues to have a special relationship with us, has had exclusive and continues to have CEREC exclusive in many areas. And bringing it all together today, allows us to move forward in a very powerful way, get the field to focus on the exclusive they have, to understand the way forward for us and to get down to what's most important, and that's taking care of the customer and executing on our plan, which is why we talked about the second half being where we expect it to grow faster.","Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Hey, Brandon, this is Josh. Just on the question about the band of inventory. I think you're referring to what we said last quarter, when we talked about a $50 million net impact. Just to be clear on what I had mentioned was that we expect a $50 million to $60 million impact going forward from here on out, with the bulk of that happening in Q2. The net impact of all of this should be $10 million to $20 million the remainder of the year. I think it's hard to pinpoint a specific number obviously, because ultimately inventory is a function of retail performance. And as Jeff alluded to, transition can cause some slowness there, but of course, clarity is important to help get that going again.","So I think from a modeling perspective, the way you should think about it is, $50 million to $60 million, bulk of that in Q2, and then like I said, remainder of the year, $10 million to $20 million. If there's a little bit more than $50 million, we think there're opportunities that we might be able to offset it with some other market channels, but again we'll continue to keep you updated.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, Brandon.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you, guys. I guess two questions. The first one, just \u2013 are there going to be any differences in how you support Patterson and Schein for maybe a sales and education perspective? Does that mean we need to think about margin profile of your business through Schein or Patterson as different at all between the two in the U.S? That's the first question.","And then Josh, just on those inventory comments. I guess I completely misunderstand in here. Guidance as of last quarter was that we would see $40 million to $60 million of the inventory headwinds for the year. We saw, I believe, $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter. Now you're saying there's another $50 million to $60 million \u2013 where's this $50 million to $60 million all of a sudden coming from? That's a new number to me. So if you can help me out there, that would be great. Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Okay. Jeff, Patterson has a 20-year experience with our product offering and infrastructure and training available today. We will work with Schein. We have a plan in place that we are not going to compromise our customers on their training and education of this and that's why we're confident about bringing on both distributors because of our ability to take care of the customer and expand our reach. And we have a lot of confidence in Henry Schein's capability to do this. With regard to the margin profile, we're not going to get into the contracts that's been agreed to by both parties, but we are confident that the way we've set up our structure benefits both Henry Schein and Patterson.","Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","So Jeff, just to, again, go back on the inventory. We talked about a net number for the year last call. You saw an impact this quarter and I talked about the $50 million to $60 million additional impact going forward. That will be bulk of it in Q2, could leak into Q3 as well. And then of course, we talked about is a net number, which means we believe there's some offset opportunity from other channels coming online.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Jeff, I think it's important to understand that what we're talking about at the end of the day is $50 million to $60 million. We absolutely believe that as other channels come online, there will be a net effect. So we have not changed from that perspective and we certainly also believe that there are global implications of this and opportunities for us.","Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. A couple. First, was there any \u2013 I mean, if we look \u2013 Technologies were still down just under 4% after adjusting for Patterson. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that was a pre-IDS slowdown? I think Schein, this morning, talked about 197 deduction for (37:01) forward sales in the year-end. So do you have any impact there, or is this also just a function of Patterson reps maybe losing a little bit more focus?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, I think, certainly that played a role in this. That's why we wanted to get the clarity out there to the field exactly what was going on. There were too many rumors that we're stalling fails and that was critical to what was important there. And certainly ahead of the IDS, it always stall sales as they look forward to see what we're going to bring out. Now on our last call, we've talked about announcing 50 new products and technology and that certainly played a role for us. We were pleased though with what we were seeing, particularly in Germany and Southern Europe, but there was, in general, slowdown.","And this doesn't just affect Europe, but this affects other parts of the world as they are looking to find out what exactly is Dentsply Sirona, but I would also highlight that our Consumables showed consecutive sequential growth in Europe ahead of this. There were no delays there. We feel good about what that tells us, we're able to do in the marketplace, but it is a function of \u2013 this was our first IDS together. The marketplace wanted to see what's Dentsply Sirona really about.","Frankly, yes, we've been together for a year, but the IDS is such a big showcase. And to be able to see the order intake and reach records for all of our product areas and segments. And in fact, CAD\/CAM benefit and specifically, CEREC, clear double-digits from us coming together. As we've always said, at Dentsply Sirona, we believe we'll accelerate the adoption of our technologies.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one follow up on CEREC dynamics. Obviously, we saw Schein did a deal with Ivoclar. Well, can you just maybe talk on some of the shifting pieces you're seeing in the market on competitive dynamics, I guess, in general for CAD\/CAM? And maybe the post-IDS reception to you guys opening up CEREC?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah sure. In a moment, I'm going to pass the call to Chris. This highlights what we've been saying to the market for years. The market is going digital. Single-visit dentistry matters to the dental professional and the patient. You cannot ignore that whether you're a materials company or an equipment company. And I would argue every dental company understands the impact that this megatrend is having. And of course, this IDS showcased the fact that Dentsply Sirona is in the best position, but of course we're going to have competitors come on to try to play a role in this. As we've said, we're only 17% penetrated in the U.S. Imagine what it is around the rest of the globe. With that, I'll turn it to Chris.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Tycho, it's Chris. I think this is case when you're successful in market, it's going to attract attention. I think that's what we have here. And as Jeff mentioned, digital dentistry is here to stay. We're at tipping point. From a competitive standpoint, more attention to the category is going to drive more interest and that's going to accelerate penetration. And we think that's good for us. Obviously we've got a good healthy respect for our competition. We're staying close to technological developments, but that's it. We're also very pleased with our technology platform that comes from over 20 years of experience and continuously leading both in innovation and also in markets insight.","So again, we're the clear leader here. We're the basis for doctors being able to perform single-visit dentistry. We're pleased with the near-term innovations, including CEREC Open and the new software that Jeff mentioned earlier. And we're continuing to make significant investments in our R&D portfolio to stay on the forefront of technology. So again, we're pleased with our position, and again, I think that overall, more attention on the category is going to helpful to accelerating penetration.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Certainly, 30 years of experience, R&D, knowhow and the team we have in place, with not only equipment, but materials today is even stronger for the future for our CEREC.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","As a reminder, we are taking one question from each caller in the interest of time. We'll take our next question from Mr. Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I want to just follow-up in a specific way on the Rest of World piece. And then, just a couple of clarifications. On Rest of World, the result was a little bit below our model. I wonder if you can reflect and I guess, it isn't necessarily have to be specific to Rest of World, on the timing of the IDS. If you look at the last few iterations of the IDS it was middle of month. You had a couple of weeks in there to complete deliveries. Did the timing of the IDS being close to the end of March, the end of the quarter have any impact? And then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Steve, it's tough to say how much timing of the IDS would play, but keep in mind that we had a difficult comp coming in, 7.5% last year and after finishing the year strong. We still believe that the Rest of World will be our fastest growing region. That hasn't changed. We've got 120 countries in the Rest of World. Asia was slower than we expected, but we expect that, that will improve in the second quarter and make up for the slowness on that.","We were pleased what we saw in Latin America growth, even given the restructuring efforts there. So we expect that Rest of World will play a critical role in the future. I think, clarifying how we're going forward in Canada, that plays a role in Rest of World and our North America will support that and that had an impact, but in general, the offering we have in Rest of World, we expect to continue to generate sales in the back half of the year.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. And I just want to follow-up on Jeff's question actually about equipment trends. I mean, given what you've seen in the DTA data, the consolidated industry data on equipment trends in the U.S. through the first quarter, how are you thinking about the equipment demand profile, not necessarily in a Dentsply Sirona specific way, but the trajectory for equipment demand in the U.S? Thanks.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, it's Chris. First off, in terms of the DTA data, there's no longer any DTA on large equipment available. So from that standpoint, again, some of the market data that may have been available is no longer. That said as we look at it, it's a little bit tough for us in terms of a barometer for the factors that Jeff mentioned, obviously, with the go-to-market strategy change, but in the quarter not announcing the clarity in terms of exactly what that is, we do think it had an impact on us. As we look at it, we do think that underlying demand is solid and stable, but it was probably not the quarter to use as the barometer for that.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","And again, today, we announced a major change in our go-to-market in the U.S. And this is one that is going to have a short and long-term impact for Dentsply Sirona, and we need to focus on how important that will affect our equipment sales with both in place and our ability for Paterson to finish strong before September. Keep in mind that as we go into DS World, we'll now have a new message to the marketplace about what's possible for them. And this should make it easier for the reps to be able to sell the product and the adoption to increase.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a bunch.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","You bet.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Jeff, just expand a little bit on the comment you made in the call about feeling like you're underpenetrated in the group practices. I think that was mainly a U.S. comment. Is your go-to-market strategy changing beyond adding Schein? If you could just expand on how you're going to push more into DSOs, that will be helpful? Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well look first of all, I think, we have a strong practice in the DSOs. Keep in mind, we go through distribution and direct with our specialty products. That won't change, but we're aggressively going after DSOs by bringing together how we present ourselves with the DSO to make sure they get the full benefit of our clinical education, our 360 programs and have integrated solutions deal with the full facets of what we're able to provide, root to crown, Class II procedures, implantology.","By being able to focus that, we believe we'll have more of an impact in the DSOs. So there's a lot of opportunity for us, because we want to not only improve our share of wallet, but increase the number of DSOs that we're working with. We're already working with most of the largest DSOs. So it is about putting our organization together, investing in those resources and being able to make sure that the focus is on an area that's growing faster than the market.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the question. Yeah just wanted to go back to the softer equipment number. The inventory wind-down does seem to be a bit of a moving target. So I'm just curious at this point, how much confidence do you feel like you have in this revised number? Is that something that you've worked more closely with Patterson to get your hands around?","And then just related to that, Jeff, I believe you mentioned weaker retail performance in your prepared remarks, particularly in the U.S. as something that was a headwind or a drag. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what you meant by retail performance and how that's separate from the inventory issue that we've discussed?","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure. Again, I think that comes back to the clarity of what's happening in the market. Bob, I can't tell you how many reps are hearing that we're imminent to opening up distribution. The distractions that, that has had, which has created uncertainty and uncertainty is never good for a rep, for an organization. And that had impact in what we were able to sell. I think with this clarity and the fact with our confidence with Patterson and what we've been able to do over the last 20 years with the exclusivity, we can get back to doing what we want to focus on, which is executing and selling the product. You also have to keep in mind that last year we introduced a new way of thinking about Chairside, with using Zirconia. We came out with the SpeedFire, which also led to changes in our milling unit, wet-dry. Those also had impacts for the prior year on this.","Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Bob, with regard to inventory \u2013 this is Josh, just to provide clarity. So recognize there was a $40 million change year-over-year related to inventory. That was Q1, right? We talked about an additional $50 million to $60 million coming, right, but for the remainder of the year, a net of $10 million to $20 million, which is to say that there's going to be an offset to that.","So what we've said is, last call we talked about $50 million. We're talking about a similar range here. Again, ultimately retail, it will dictate how much or how little this will be, but we're still in the general range as we're talking about. So it's never a perfect target, but I don't want to give you the impression that it's a moving target. It's still within the same range. It's just a function of, remember, we talked about this being a tale of two halves in terms of the year. We talked about the first half having a significant headwind in inventory. We talked about strong growth in the back half of the year, right? We reiterated our guidance and so we're just reiterating that same message.","We obviously had the first impact in Q1. You'll continue to see impact in Q2 and you'll get the benefit of the other market or the channels coming on line, which will offset that headwind in the back half of the year which will drive our growth. So the net is in the same realm, right. Again, we can't pinpoint it exactly, but I don't want you to walk away thinking there's a significant change here, because there isn't.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","No there really isn't. Again, the big picture is about the net result for the year. And we haven't changed that. We've said the first quarter was going to be challenged. And actually, it would also be the first half and it was all about the second half. So I want to be clear that we continue to be on track believing that what we gave the guidance, and that's why we haven't changed our guidance.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll try to ask both upfront. So first one, Jeff, just your thoughts on capital allocation and possibly getting more aggressive on the share repo. It seems like you're sensing or seeing the worldwide dental market picking up. You've got broader distribution going forward. You called out several times you expect momentum to increase in the back half of the year and sort of continue into 2018 and you're sitting here on a very solid balance sheet. So just your thoughts on maybe flexing the balance sheet a bit more here in the near-term.","And then the second question, just quickly is a lot of moving parts for 2Q. I mean, you guys have hit on inventory but you also have sort of the ship outs going on from IDS. So curious if you want to give any clarity on the EPS cadence on line and just how to think about the moving parts for the remainder of the year? Thanks guys.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Right. We have a clear buy back in place. We've already deployed over $1 billion in capital \u2013 in acquisitions and buy back. We continue to do that. That's an important lever. We have a very strong balance sheet, which we will continue to use. So I don't see that changing. Certainly, that's part of what we've talked about. We also said that we were going to do $50 million to $100 million per quarter. We did $85 million this quarter. So we're staying on track with what we believe. With regard to the EPS, clearly we don't get into quarterly guidance, but the back half assumes that we expect to have acceleration on that.","Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Good morning, Jeff, Chris, Josh and Derek. So I know you guys can't talk too much about the terms of these new U.S. distribution deals, but I guess I first have a question is, will a U.S. sale of CEREC through Schein be more profitable to you than what CEREC unit profit margin has been under Patterson previously? And then also is Schein going sell just CEREC in the U.S. for Chairside, CAD\/CAM, crown restoration, or are they still going to have the option to sell other Chairside crown restoration systems if they want to? Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks for the question. Again, this is about Schein having our full distributed line. They'll have everything with regard to CAD\/CAM as well as our imaging products, our Treatment Centers and our instruments. We're not going to get into margin profile. Obviously, we believe that this structure is in the best interest of both parties and it's about accelerating growth for both of us.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And the other quick thing, this is more of a comment than really just a question, but I still don't really get the notion of the Patterson's sales force distraction, that they know they're still going to be selling it going forward. You think they'd want to work harder to lock-in sales before a new distributor comes in. I don't understand why they'd lay down in this situation but again that's sort of the sidebar comment I guess I'll look forward to seeing you guys at our conference next week and we can hopefully talk about this in more detail. Thanks.","Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Look, again, until you have clarity in the market, it leads to confusion. And you have to understand that, that is the fact. When Patterson on their call in November announced that they would be opening up distribution with it, that brought certain uncertainty for the marketplace. We feel we've dealt with that. I mean, we're very excited with what we've announced today with Patterson as well and we think that will have an impact for us. So both Henry Schein and Patterson, coming together understanding what is going to be exactly what we do moving forward will allow everyone to focus on execution.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS.","Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. This is Vik Chopra in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the Consumables business, kind of what areas of strength you've seen, maybe specialty versus general products? And what you're seeing in terms of ASPs? And my second question is on gross margins. How should we think about gross margins heading into the rest of year? And can we expect any expansion over last year? Thanks.","Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. Vik, it's Chris. Relative to the Consumables, I mean we have pretty solid and consistent growth really across the various SBUs, if you will, both on the Chairside as well as on the specialties, particularly solid, relative to endo. Again we look pretty solid underlying U.S. sell-through trends which again, we're pleased with. Europe was very solid from a core Consumables standpoint.","So again, I think, that we feel good about how that business is executing. There's a number of new innovations that we showed at the IDS. New products really do drive those businesses pretty significantly, which again we're pleased with what we've brought to market. And again I think that relative to the margins or the pricing, again we're able to hold price fine. We're able to take reasonable price generally on these businesses. So again I don't think we see any significant change in those competitive dynamics.","Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Vik, as far as gross margin for the year, we don't get into that level of detail. What I would tell you is that this quarter, margins were impacted by the timing of the merger last year. Remember, last year had the strongest selling month for Sirona, so that gave us a difficult comparison. We talked about margins year-over-year in terms of operating margins to be similar to last year, but that actually implies underlying growth because again, you'll recall that last year we benefited from that strong selling month. So overall, remember gross margins, you have a lot of moving parts in there between product mix and FX. And so we'll just talk about the operating margin level for the year.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our moderators for any additional or closing remarks.","Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well thank you, everyone, for joining us today on today's conference call, and thanks for your interest on Dentsply Sirona. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and of course, we'll update you again on August. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Derek Leckow","","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's first quarter 2014 results. I'm joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. I would point out that a copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides relating to any non-GAAP financials are also available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.dentsply.com under the heading Events and Presentations. ","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings. ","It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make today. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret Wise","","Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thanks again for joining us on our first quarter call. I have some brief comments on our results and also some areas of focus for the company going forward, and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim and Chris to elaborate further on those points.","Starting with the headline here, we had a pretty good start to the year with adjusted EPS growth of 13.5% for the quarter, despite what has proven to be a pretty slow growth market environment. At a high level, this was driven by operating margin expansion, which we\u2019ve talked about many times on these calls over the last year or so, and this continues to be a high priority for the company going forward, and of course we\u2019ll speak more to that today.","Overall, sales for the quarter were up 2.5%, excluding precious metals. The 2.5% reflects 1.1% internal growth and 0.8% from acquisitions to give us growth in local currencies of 1.9% and then the balance is currency translation. Internal growth in the U.S. was essentially flat at a positive 0.1%, which we think reflects market conditions and I\u2019ll elaborate more on that in a moment. Europe was negative 1.3%, greatly influenced by conditions in Russia and the Ukraine. And rest of world was positive 8.9%.","So in the U.S., the quarter started out very slow, both for us and for the market. In fact, it was negative through February. This was driven entirely by the Eastern regions, states east of the Mississippi, which were very negative the first two months of the year, whereby the regions west of the Mississippi were positive and, quote normal.","The market did recover a little bit in March and we believe that\u2019s more indicative of quote normal conditions for the U.S. and we like to see that continue going forward. The markets in Europe saw some acceleration, which is encouraging. We saw some acceleration in the Western part of Europe or the historical part of Europe, and that was offset by a very large, a very significant drop-off in Russia and in the Ukraine during the quarter.","Kind of peeling the onion bag here, the fact is that this is one of the stronger quarters we\u2019ve seen for some time in Western Europe, which was up low-single digits, and Germany, in particular, was strong across most of or essentially all of our product lines, so very broad acceleration in Germany and Western Europe in the quarter, offset by some very negative results in Russia and the Ukraine.","In rest of world, we had strong growth in Pacific RIM, Canada, Japan, Middle East and Australia, in other words, many, many countries that are included in that rest of world category for us. Japan is likely due in part to the increase in VAT that went effective April 1. We saw some buying ahead of that in the March time frame. But even without Japan, we had strong mid-single digit growth in the rest of world regions.","Overall, it was a bit of a slow start on the top line due to the reasons I noted here, but I\u2019d say also some encouraging signs, particularly in Western Europe. On a global product category basis, dental consumables, dental specialties were both up low-single digits, healthcare was positive mid-single digits and lab was down low-single digits.","Profitability was strong with the adjusted operating margins up 150 basis points, and as I mentioned, adjusted earnings per share were up 13.5%. This quarter was against a flat comp last year, I think it\u2019s important to note it was a relatively easier comp in the first quarter than the hurdle that we\u2019ll see for the remainder of the year.","I\u2019d say these results reflect and they\u2019re part of an ongoing strategy to grow earnings through better leveraging our portfolio of companies and our cost structure, even in differing economic environments. So the strategy is to put the company in a position where we can grow operating margins and have some reinvestments in growth initiatives even in a slow growth environment. The same structure and same strategy should then provide for accelerated earnings growth when markets are more robust.","Some of these strategies relate to synergies from recent acquisitions, which we\u2019ve talked about many times on these calls, but also from improving the leverage of our cost structure in the historical DENTSPLY businesses, including a team focused on capacity utilization and overhead absorption.","During the first quarter, we did complete some plant consolidations and we have some planned for later in the year, which are already announced, and Jim will comment more on those in a moment. Also, in this quarter, we kicked off a global procurement initiative, which will be implemented over the next two to three years.","The company has historically operated on a very decentralized basis for procurement. We\u2019re looking to bring some of that -- roll some of that up to give us much more purchasing power and we think that will generate benefits going forward. We do expect that there will be some near-term costs for this effort over the next few quarters, however, we see that we should be able to generate benefits sufficient to offset these costs by the time we exit the year.","Based on the opportunities we see to better leverage our cost structure over the next few years and then free up cash for reinvestment in growth initiatives, we\u2019re establishing a new operating margin target this morning of 20% to be attained in three years. In addition, we see a path for much better asset turnover and utilization, which when combined with the operating margin improvement, will also improve our ROIC performance back to historical levels.","So to sum up, we\u2019re pleased with our double-digit earnings growth for the start of the year. Looking at our current guidance, we\u2019re a bit ahead at this point, however, we do know we will have some incremental costs for the next one to two quarter for the points that I\u2019ve noted, and then should realize some savings to offset that later in the year.","So, although it\u2019s early and market conditions remain uncertain to this point, we feel comfortable now adjusting full-year guidance to a range of $2.47 to $2.55 per adjusted diluted share for the full year.","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Jim for an update on some operational topics. Jim?","James Mosch","Thank you, Bret. I\u2019d like to provide a brief perspective on a few operational items and then turn it over to Chris for the financial review. As Bret mentioned, we experienced unusually slow growth in the U.S. in the first quarter, concentrated in the Eastern half of the country. We were negative through February, but saw conditions return to more normal trends in March.","Turning to implants, we saw solid recovery in our German implant business, albeit to a lower comparison, driven by the German integration in the prior year, yet we are seeing stability and solid improvement. Key to our implant performance in the quarter and for this year is the launch of a new implant system, ASTRA TECH EV. ASTRA TECH EV was launched to several markets in Q1, but with primary focus on North America. The EV system builds upon a deep portfolio of technology and clinical documentation and specifically addresses clinical elements to take this system to a new level in terms of simplicity and flexibility.","EV has new drilling protocol, which reduces clinical procedure time, a flexible and clinically-oriented surgical tray, improved initial stability upon implant placement, and with respect to the restorative procedure, a simplified abutment placement process that ties seamlessly into our market-leading ATLANTIS customized abutment platform.","Our initial feedback from the U.S. market has been excellent and customer adoption is higher than anticipated. In Q2 and Q3, we will be executing the global launch of EV and concurrently managing the transition to the new system. While sales are initially driven by current customer conversion, we have been pleased with our ability to convert competitive platforms.","Other new product launches during Q1 included ProTaper Gold, which is an improvement to our market-leading ProTaper endodontic file system. ProTaper Gold offers superior flexibility, fatigue resistance and clinical utilities. In addition, we continue to get traction from product launched in 2013 such as AQUASIL ULTRA Cordless, TPH Spectra, MIDWEST automate, the Origo male catheter, and two new varnish products, all launched in 2013.","Operationally, we have been pursuing several initiatives to improve operating performance. We completed one plant consolidation in Q1 and announced another that will be completed at the end of Q2. This is consistent with our strategy to improve capacity utilization and return on our invested capital in part as a synergy from recent acquisitions and in part from leveraging our broadest platform of assets, including the historical DENTSPLY businesses.","As part of these efforts, we are also looking for better working capital utilization, although it typically requires an investment going into these activities. Overall, despite some slow growth this quarter, we are pleased with our ability to better manage, leverage our portfolio and expand margins.","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.","Christopher Clark","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our financial performance for the first quarter and also discuss our 2014 earnings and capital allocation outlook and finally some additional perspective on the initiatives that Brett mentioned in his remarks.","For the first quarter, sales, excluding precious metals, grew 2.5% compared to prior year, including 110 basis points of internal growth, 80 basis point benefit from recent acquisition and favorable currency translation of 60 basis points. ","Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 57.8% of sales excluding precious metals, which was a decline of approximately 40 basis points from 58.2% in the first quarter of 2013. This reflects the aggregate negative currency transaction impact as a result of the decline in rates of the emerging market and non-European developed market currencies that I spoke about in the last earnings call. And this basket of currencies is now down 10% versus the U.S. dollar compared to a year ago, which in the gross profit rate line really more than offset a net positive price impact in the quarter.","SG&A expenses declined 2.3% on an adjusted basis and as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, they improved by 200 basis points to 40.1%, compared to 42.1% in the first quarter of 2013. This reflects the impact of synergies from restructuring and efficiency initiatives that we implemented last year, as well as lower spending on trade shows, notably the biennial IDS show.","Operating margin for the quarter improved by 150 basis points to 17.7% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, compared to 16.2% in the first quarter last year, reflecting the better leverage and the overall SG&A savings that I just described. Importantly, on a rolling four-quarter basis, adjusted operating margin has improved by 70 basis points from the previous four quarters, which is well in excess of our long-term objective of 20 to 40 basis points annually, and this is coming despite the challenging global market environment, as well as sizeable headwinds from currency and medical device tax over much of that period.","This is consistent with the comments we have made previously and that Bret reinforced this morning, that a key operational objective has been to improve operating platform, our operating platform to allow for margin expansion even in slower growth environments.","Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.02 per share due largely -- due to the negative impacts from the currencies in Canada, Russia, Australia, Latin America and Asia-Pacific region relative to the strengthening of the euro and the Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, as these currencies weaken, our cost of products in local currencies there rises, creating gross margin headwinds as we import goods into these markets from the U.S. and from Europe.","Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 23.5% while our non-operating -- our operating or non-GAAP tax rate, excuse me, was 22.6%, which represented an 80 basis point increase compared to our operating rate for the first quarter of last year. This is consistent with our comment from the last call that we continue to anticipate that tax will be a bit of -- will be a headwind between 70 basis points and 100 basis points for the year.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY international on an as-reported basis in the first quarter was $72.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share and this compares to $71.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules of the release.","On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew to $85.5 million from $75.2 million in the prior-year quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.5% to $0.59 per diluted share. Of course, this earnings growth rate includes the headwinds for both currency and tax that I described earlier.","The company incurred approximately $800,000 in net restructuring costs in the quarter. These costs are related to the plant consolidations that Jim mentioned and we anticipate that we are going to see additional restructuring charges related to these initiatives as well as other footprint consolidation opportunities as we move forward.","Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $64.6 million, up from $34.8 million last year. Inventories now stand at 120 days, which is up six days, compared to December 2013, and up 10 days compared to prior year. And as we mentioned on several previous earnings calls, we have strategically increased inventory in a few businesses as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operational changes. We anticipate that inventory may continue to increase slightly through midyear to support these efforts before returning to more normal levels as we move through 2014 and 2015.","Accounts receivable days were 61 days at the end of March, up five days from year end, mainly due to seasonality, and are up two days compared to March 2013. Capital expenditures were $25 million in the quarter while depreciation was $21 million and amortization was $13 million.","In the quarter, the company repurchased just under 900,000 shares. In terms of our capital deployment approach, I want to reiterate that our intent continues to be to support repaying debt while also using -- balancing uses of free cash flow to support reinvesting in the business, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends, so really continuing to be a balanced approach.","Finally, as Bret stated, based on our first quarter results as well as our current view of the relevant market factors, we\u2019re adjusting our adjusted -- we\u2019re updating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.47 to $2.55.","Our guidance reflects the impact of a more difficult comparison in Q2, including a 19.2% operating margin rate last year as well as additional consulting costs associated with the efficiency purchasing initiatives that Bret described. It also reflects the anticipated benefits from these efforts as we move through the year, recognizing that these will accelerate as we move to 2015 and beyond, enabling us to return to a 20% adjusted operating margin rate in three years.","This completes our prepared remarks and we certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019d now be glad to take any questions you might have.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Bret, just want to talk to you on the operating margin target, I don\u2019t remember you guys ever kind of throwing a three-year target out there, maybe you have, I just don\u2019t remember at this point, but a few questions on that, one, should we be thinking about the 170 basis points or so that that implies over a three-year period of improvement off last year\u2019s number of kind of a consistent 50 to 60 basis points a year, each of the next three years, number one. Number two, anything other than better procurement, maybe that you could go into some detail on what gives you the confidence over the next three years on that. And then, what are your organic growth assumptions in that, if we go back to a 4% or 5% organic growth rate, would there be upside to that or is that kind of a base case assumption that we stick with at this point? Thanks.","Bret Wise","There is a lot there, but let me try to plow through it. The operating margin target of 20% is compared to a baseline 2013 of 17.6%, so it\u2019s a 240 basis points improvement over the three-year period. Like most things in life, it won\u2019t come in, in a linear basis, it will be a little bit bumpy. For instance, we had a very strong operating margin improvement in the first quarter. We\u2019re going up against a very tough comp in the second quarter. So I think even in this year you won\u2019t see it come in on a linear basis over the four quarters.","But I think you should expect to see us make progress against that 230 -- 240 basis points each year, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re going to take a year off, we\u2019re going to be needing to make progress on that each year. You mentioned procurement and other things, there are other things, including better leveraging our whole cost structure, our overhead structure and our capacity utilization in the facilities in particular on top of procurement. So it\u2019s a broader initiative than just the procurement initiative that we mentioned on the call here this morning.","I\u2019m not going to make any assumptions on organic growth over that period of time, the reason is it\u2019s hard enough for us to predict a year. I don\u2019t want to predict three years out. But the theory here and the modeling that we\u2019re doing is, is that we would adjust our cost structure such that we could grow earnings in a low growth environment which would kind of turbocharge the earnings if the global consumable market return to that 4% to 5% range. ","So we\u2019re taking both those into account, and rather than making an organic growth assumption out three years, we\u2019re trying to set the company up for success despite what the market conditions would hold.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","That\u2019s helpful. And then, just one last question, just on Russia and Ukraine, as you mentioned that took a big chunk out of Europe. Is there any chance you could give us any kind of Europe ex those markets or size for us, how bad those markets are, where and what percentage they might be of Europe in that, just to help us out with the math on that.","Bret Wise","I\u2019m going to start on this and I\u2019m going to let then Chris comment, probably on our international growth, ex Russia and Ukraine. But just for perspective, because of the devaluation of the currencies in both Russia and Ukraine, I think that those markets are feeling a lot of pressure and consumer confidence is certainly off because of the war activity.","So our sales in the first quarter in those two countries were down strong double digits, I mean materially down. And that\u2019s in part due to some pretty tight credit standards that we hold to and in part due to, I think, consumer confidence in those markets as well. Now, that could rebound at any time, but it\u2019s hard to predict when that might happen. So let me then turn this over to Chris.","Christopher Clark","On the international basis, excluding Russia and CIS, we\u2019re up low-to-mid single digits, so I mean, we were north of 3%, and again, I think overall have some pretty nice momentum, as Bret mentioned, in Western Europe as well as in many of those rest of world countries.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","All right, Chris. I\u2019ll work through the math, but that -- Europe, that was not a Europe number up low-to-mid single digits, that\u2019s the international. Thank you.","Bret Wise","Europe would be up low-single digits as well.","Christopher Clark","Europe is also up low-single digits.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Bret, I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made regarding the U.S. I think you seemed to suggest that U.S. was negative for the first two months of the year, and you said the weakness was predominantly in the Eastern half of the country. And I'm guessing you're making the obvious connection that it was weather-related. I was wondering if you could sort of quantify what you thought weather might have impacted your sales in the current quarter. And then as a follow-up to that, I think you suggested that March had kind of snapped back, and I'm kind of curious if you're willing to extend that comment to April. Are you pretty confident that it's sort of back to business as normal?","Bret Wise","Let me just give you a little bit of color there. First of all, Derek has a jar in the table here and every time I use the W word, I have to put $10 in the jar. So I\u2019m not going to use the W word.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Every other company is, you might as well.","Bret Wise","But we\u2019re different. To give you a little perspective, there was a 500 basis point difference between our regions, east of the Mississippi and west of the Mississippi for the first two months of the year. So it was a pretty dramatic notable and material impact in January and February.","That did mitigate somewhat as we exited the quarter, such that the difference for the entire quarter is only 250 basis points, but it was still pretty material impact over the entire quarter and again that\u2019s the difference between East and West.","I have a little bit of hard time quantifying what weather actually did to the U.S. market and to our results in particular in a quantifiable way, but it\u2019s certainly clear that it diminished the growth pretty significantly. I mean offices were closed in the East side of the country for three, four days during the quarter, so that comes right out of sales.","It\u2019s premature for me to talk about April. I will say that March did perk up quite a bit and we\u2019re hopeful to see that continue now into the second quarter. Anything to add to that?","Christopher Clark","No, I think it\u2019s pretty accurate. Again, the -- March did come back. Now we have an extra shipping day in March as well, but in short, there is no doubt that it was a different pattern than what we saw in January and February.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Hey, Chris, maybe if I could just follow up on the comments you made regarding currency in the quarter. I think you suggested -- you gave us some detail on the currency, and I think you suggested it was a $0.02 impact in the quarter. If I go back to the comments you made last quarter, I think you were embedding within your original guidance a $0.04 currency impact for the full year. And it seems like you've already incurred half of that hit in the first quarter. How are you thinking about the impact of FX on the full year now? And has that sort of changed within the context of your guidance?","Christopher Clark","Yes, Glen, I think at this point, we\u2019re pretty similar to where we -- I think it\u2019s pretty similar to where we were. You are right in the context that we indicated about $0.04 headwind embedded in the guidance. We\u2019ve experienced $0.02 in the first quarter. We knew first quarter was going to be the most difficult comparison for us.","The challenge obviously is the rates are just bouncing around a ton right now. We are anticipating that the headwind, if you will, in the emerging market currencies and really the non-European developed currencies will continue. And obviously that\u2019s got some risk on sales as well because of the pricing challenges there as well in some of those markets.","But at this point, it\u2019s just too early and too volatile really for us to forecast differently, so we\u2019re keeping a close eye on it and we\u2019ll obviously reflect any significant changes as we move forward, but I think at this point in time, we are staying put with where we were.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Just wanted to circle back, Bret, you've talked a lot about on this call about accelerating efforts to leverage the platform and get more out of the cost structure. Given there hasn't really been any notable change to the organization in the last few years, I was just curious maybe around timing and what specific initiatives and timelines that you're targeting to really get more leverage out of the business.","Bret Wise","I think if we go back and talk about or look at what we\u2019ve been talking about on these calls for some time, this has been a topic that\u2019s been of importance to us. We did see our operating margins decline two, three years ago coming out of the recession, in part due to ortho and in part due to the acquisition of ASTRA TECH and we\u2019ve been busy trying to repair the ortho business, and then also get the synergies out of the ASTRA TECH acquisition, and I think you\u2019re seeing us get some of those benefits here over the last four quarters.","The idea though is that the business is structured largely as it was when it was a $1 billion business, now it\u2019s a $3 billion business, it\u2019s rather complex in the supply chain, we think there is some ability -- things we learned through the ASTRA TECH integration but also some other learnings that we\u2019ve had that make it apparent that there is probably more to leverage in this platform than maybe thought four, five years ago and so we\u2019re now moving forward to get those.","So, I wouldn\u2019t consider this something that\u2019s brand new. I think that you\u2019ll probably see this, if you go back and look, you\u2019ll see this in our remarks over the last 12 months or maybe 18 months, but there is an acceleration in the efforts and in certain cases like procurement, which we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019ve gone out to get outside help to make that -- to get to that quicker. So I think it\u2019s an acceleration of what we are thinking before rather than a directional change in what we were thinking before.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","I think coupled with the introduction of the three-year operating margin goal, it just seems a little bit maybe more pronounced this call. These efforts clearly have been ongoing. I guess just changing gears over to the implant business, and I apologize if I missed this, but can you guys maybe just update us on what the growth looked like in the quarter by region? How have the implant -- how have your implant businesses trended relative to your original expectations, and any notable change in the competitive landscape?","James Mosch","This is Jim Mosch. As far as our global implant business is concerned, we have the benefit as the premium implant companies that reported at this point in time, and what we see from a market perspective is that, on a constant currency basis, the growth is going to range at 2% to 6%.","As we look at our own business, we would say that we\u2019re on the lower end of that range, however, as Bret mentioned, one of our more significant impacts was in Europe, within Russian and CIS, and if we exclude that impact, we would be at the upper end of that range. And we are one of the market leaders in Russia, so the impact was certainly more pronounced.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Bret or Jim, can you speak to any traction you're seeing with the new MTM product and how is the uptake of that pacing in the U.S. relative to your expectations? Do you think you're capturing any share at the low end of the market there?","James Mosch","As you know, Brandon, we launched that in the latter part of 2013, really kind of a preliminary launch at the ADA in October. The traction has been good and one of the aspects of the system is that customers purchase a kit, they\u2019re trained and then there is a -- they do their initial cases and then the question is your ability to build upon that case submission.","And we\u2019ve seen good movement in that. We have a couple of regions we had launched in Canada earlier and actually we can see their progress and how those case submissions have grown and we are beginning to see traction in the United States. So we are pleased with our ability to place kits, but I would say we are probably at the early stage of that.","Bret Wise","And I might add to that, Brandon, that this product, because of some technique sensitivity and so forth, requires clinical education to get it moving. So one of the barriers here is to get people into courses, get them trained and get them through that first case submission that Jim was talking about. We\u2019re pleased with where it is, although I think we\u2019ve emphasized that this is a product for minor tooth movement, not full cases, and it will be interesting to see where we can take it.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","And then Chris, on the inventory front, do you think we're at a plateau level here yet? And could you give us an update on your operating cash flow expectations for the year?","Christopher Clark","From an inventory standpoint, we indicated that inventories would creep up a bit through the first half of the year associated with really some of the strategic moves, obviously we referenced a bit of that this morning. I would anticipate, Brandon, that could possibly come up a little bit more in the second quarter and then our expectations are that inventory comes down from there and we make progress on that. ","Certainly, from a cash flow standpoint, we\u2019re pleased relative to the first quarter. I think that we\u2019ve got some opportunities relative to net working capital as we move forward. From there, I think that\u2019s something certainly that management is very focused on. So, from that angle, I think, over the -- probably another quarter of a bit of an inventory build, but then over like several quarters our expectation is we make more progress on that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","I wonder if you could spend a minute on execution in the implant business. Now that you're at the outset here of 2014, we have a better understanding of what the realities are in the end markets, and you're through the sales force integrations globally. Would you say you're at a point now in 2014 where you feel like you're on your front foot in a position to take share? Are you in a position where you might be thinking at all about any incremental changes to distribution or product strategy? And can you give us a sense for where you think you might land relative to market growth this year?","James Mosch","Yes, Steve. This is Jim Mosch. From a standpoint of what you characterize with the integration, I would say that that\u2019s accurate. We completed really our last integration, which was Japan in June of last year, as one of our -- and we did really three largest ones in last year which was Japan, France and Germany in the first half of last year.","We have moved through those and some of those, as we mentioned with Germany, we\u2019ve seen stabilization and I feel that we are on our front foot. As we look at the business overall, I mentioned EV, I can\u2019t emphasize enough, we do not -- we have basically three implant platforms, this is a new one, it is very much of a successor to the current OsseoSpeed TX system. So this is a major event for us. And we will be fully occupied with the global launch of this product in 2014 and beyond.","Additionally, we continue to enhance our ATLANTIS platform. That continues to be a real strong part of our portfolio, continues to grow and expand. We\u2019ve been very pleased with that performance and certainly we will seek to expand that globally.","We also have plans to expand our regenerative portfolio, which is primarily U.S. based at this point in time. So we have a lot of activities in place that we feel that will allow us really to leverage the business platform that we\u2019ve created. And I think we are in a comfortable position. There are some markets that certainly are challenging right now, obviously we mentioned the whole Russia CIS issue, Southern Europe has kind of -- it takes a step forward, two steps back, but overall we are comfortable where we are progressing.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","And then, just one clarification on the business in North America, I know thinking back to a couple quarters ago, there was an expectation that we'd see a normalization of inventories in the distributor channel and that might be a bit of a drag. Was that a factor here in the quarter, and are we through that trend where distributor inventories are back to normal? Thanks.","Christopher Clark","Yes. It\u2019s Chris. I will take that. At this point, we really think channel inventories in aggregate really have minimum impact on sales growth in the quarter. We had some gives and takes across the businesses. Obviously, if you look at Japan, for instance, there\u2019s probably some build in the channel there. There was some takedown of some channels, some other businesses.","So, we really don\u2019t think at this point that the channel inventory net change in the quarter was demonstrably different from what we saw a year ago. So I wouldn\u2019t guide that it really had a real impact on the quarter results.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Krieger with William Blair.","Robbie Fatta - William Blair","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Robbie Fatta in for John today. A follow-up on the impact of EV, how should we think of aggregate new product introduction benefits in 2014 versus 2013 given this significant launch?","James Mosch","Yes, Robbie. When we look at an implant conversion, I think, as I said, this is a successor product. So at the end of the day, our expectation is, over a period of time, we will have a group of EVs as opposed to the previous OsseoSpeed product, that\u2019s really what our objective is.","Our long-term objective is not to have a legacy implant system in the marketplace. So, in order to do that, obviously you have a conversion process and that oftentimes the involvement of the customer basically purchasing a new surgical kit also some new implants. There is a tendency for them to liquidate their existing inventories at times so that you see a little bit of a pullback of a purchase of the older system as they buy the new system and there is a conversion process.","One of the things that I mentioned in my comments is we are happy that the clinical effectiveness and utility of this product has encouraged some competitive platform users. We are heavily focused with our existing conversion, our existing users at this point in time. We would hope for a little bit of an uptick, but to be realistic, in 2014, we\u2019re very much in a conversion phase and I think that that\u2019s going to be fairly consuming from a standpoint of our business focus.","Robbie Fatta - William Blair","And just as a quick follow-up, on the acquisition front, how are you guys thinking about that this year? Is the activity ramping up or are you seeing it fairly stable right now?","Christopher Clark","Yes, Robbie. It\u2019s Chris. At this point I think a couple of points in that. First off, we are obviously focusing on integrating kind of three transactions here over the last three of four months. We certainly have others in the pipeline. I would say it\u2019s certainly an area we continue to be active, but it would be premature really at this point to comment further other than obviously acquisition growth and making the company stronger via acquisition continues to be a key focus area for us, but it\u2019s always hard to predict the timing of transactions. We continue to be active. We\u2019re, right now, focused on integrating kind of the transactions here, the three we\u2019ve had over the last few months and again, we continue to pound the pavement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel","Maybe first one, Bret, I know you gave some commentary in and around implants, but is there any specifics you can share with us within specialties of low single-digit growth? If you could break out ortho versus endo versus implant directionally?","Bret Wise","We don\u2019t like to break the business down into eight or nine pieces and give all the pieces, but I will tell you that, as Jim mentioned, implants was in the -- he said the range was 2% to 6%. We are in low end of that range with Russia, high end of that range without Russia, so that gives you some idea there.","Endodontics continue to perform well and ortho is a business that\u2019s under really, really heavy competitive conditions right now. So we\u2019ve performed the lowest of the three businesses in that category.","Jon Block - Stifel","And then just sort of a bigger picture on a higher level, if you can speak to your thoughts on market share. It's always been sort of the DENTSPLY mantra to get on the call and say you've taken market share, and I realize there's always moving parts and you called out Russia. But if I go back and look at your numbers over the past maybe four, five, six quarters, it looks like you might be lagging versus some of your competitors. So can you speak to how you feel DENTSPLY's position in the market has evolved over the past four or five quarters, and do you still think you're taking share? And if not, how is that going to change in the coming quarters?","Bret Wise","Well, it varies by business of course, but overall, for instance, in this quarter, we feel pretty good about Western Europe and the rest of world categories. I would say with rest of world close to nine, we probably are taking share in those regions. Western Europe and Germany, we feel pretty good about right now given the results we had this quarter.","Certainly in Russia and Ukraine, who knows because we\u2019re down strong double digits, I assume everybody is down pretty significantly there. We just happen to have a large share, so maybe it\u2019s a disproportionate impact on us.","On the U.S., I am a little bit hesitant to comment yet, I mean we think the market was flat in the quarter, that\u2019s based on our results because we don\u2019t have the industry data yet and we don\u2019t have the two large distributors having reported although I think one reported today, so we might learn more than that today.","But we suspect that our number of 0.1% growth seems low, but it also feels to us that the market was probably flat, maybe the market was down, we don\u2019t know yet. So I don\u2019t anticipate that we are losing share with a 0.1% growth as low as that seems. So overall, I think I feel pretty good about it. Of course, it varies by business. Some areas, I think we\u2019re taking share, some areas that we\u2019re neutral and there is probably a few isolated cases where we are losing share. I think in the lab category, in particular, we continue to lose some share.","Jon Block - Stifel","Maybe two more quick ones if I could. First is a clarification, the 20% op margin goal, is that specific to full-year '16, full-year '17, somewhere in between, just any clarity there?","Bret Wise","Well, it\u2019s three years out, so it\u2019s full-year \u201817. We like to be in a position exiting \u201816 where we can hit that target in \u201817.","Jon Block - Stifel","Lastly, Bret, last call you talked about your guidance and sort of lined it up versus market growth of around 100 BPs in North America and a little bit more than that O-U.S. And like you said, weather-wise, we got off to a slow start in North America and then O-U.S. you ran into problems in Russia. Yet, here you are confirming guidance, arguably bumping it up by $0.01. Can you just compare and contrast that? Do you still feel good on those -- the market growth metrics that you broke out last quarter going forward for the year? Thanks, guys.","Bret Wise","Okay, that\u2019s a good question. I think what we said in our February call is we are expecting a 100 basis point improvement in market conditions in both the U.S. and Europe. I would say generally speaking, we see that emerging in Western Europe, we like to see that continue, that\u2019s always a risk, but right now we feel pretty good about that.","Certainly, the U.S. did not accelerate and in fact slowed down materially in this first quarter. We\u2019re thinking that\u2019s an anomaly and we\u2019re going to see that bounce back later in the year, that is embedded in our guidance that we are going to -- we expect the U.S. market to improve not only over what happened in the first quarter, but what happened last year. So there is some risk to that, because we haven\u2019t seen that happen yet.","Russia and the Ukraine, the lapse was not in our guidance and we\u2019ll have to overcome that in other areas in order to be in our guidance range and we\u2019ve got some ideas on how to do that. So we are still expecting the acceleration in the U.S. and Europe. Russia looks very uncertain, currency looks very uncertain and on balance though we think that the guidance lift here makes sense based on what we see in the pipeline right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Just a couple of clarification questions from me as well. First, on the incremental cost you talked about for the next one to two quarters for the savings programs, are those going to be considered separate restructuring costs or are those going to flow through the P&L and the regular COGS and\/or SG&A lines?","Christopher Clark","Those consulting costs will flow through the regular SG&A and COGS lines.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","And also just to clarify a little further on the 20% EBIT margin goal. Will most of that expansion then come through in the gross margin line or should we expect some material improvement in the SG&A line as a percent of revenues as well? Thanks.","Bret Wise","It\u2019s going to be a balance of both. I think on the capacity utilization, the overhead absorption issue that will come through the cost of goods sold line and then leveraging our overhead structure, our SG&A structure, of course, comes through the SG&A line. So it will be a balance.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","Just wonder if I could get your thoughts on capital spending. Certainly, the figure you're looking at this year and then going forward, given your operating profit margin goal, and again, in consideration for plant consolidations and so forth.","Christopher Clark","Greg, it\u2019s Chris. We\u2019ll take a shot at that. I think relative to 2014, I think in our original guidance we guided to about $130 million in capital spending for the year. That includes some larger projects that -- we have some carryover, if you will, from 2013, so I still think that\u2019s a reasonable number at this stage in the game, if anything, we may be a little bit light to that, but I think that $130 million is probably a reasonable number.","As we move forward, I mean certainly one of the objectives of these initiatives are to better leverage our cost structure and I would say that includes capital spending as well. There may be some investments necessary to do that, but again we\u2019ll provide color on that as we move into it. But I think over a longer period of time, you would expect again as part of our cost structure, us being able to leverage our asset base more effectively as well.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","And related to that, are there any changes being made in the R&D, the way it's being handled out of facilities or the focus?","Christopher Clark","R&D will be part of this effort to get better utilization of R&D. Today it\u2019s spread around quite a bit throughout the company although we don\u2019t think there will be a physical consolidation of R&D. There might be a virtual impact on R&D where we bring scientists together on platforms virtually. I\u2019d also say that R&D, we mentioned we think we can improve our efficiency and then part of that efficiency we\u2019ll put back and reinvestment in R&D is one of the areas that we would focus on for that reinvestment.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","One last one. You mentioned 900,000 shares purchased in the quarter. What was the dollar amount spent on the share repurchase in the quarter?","Christopher Clark","It was about $36 million, net of option proceeds.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Jim, one follow-up just on the EV product itself, I'm going back through my notes, and it looks to me like you guys were going to be selling that product or thought you were going to be selling at about a 5% to 10% price premium to your other kind of higher-end products. Is that what you're seeing so far in the U.S. market? And maybe if you're getting that, would love to hear kind of how you're positioning that to your customers in a market where generics are obviously gaining traction, how you position a premium price and a price increase to your customers. Thanks.","James Mosch","The EV product is at a slight price premium. I think in the -- as I kind of outlined to the earlier question, in the early stages of this process where you\u2019re converting a customer, you have an awful lot going on there as it relates to the swap out of surgical kits and things of that nature, the purchase of those, these tend to be a bundle purchase, so some of that is difficult to see at the early stages. We are seeing a slight price uptick and we will expect that to continue long term.","Bret Wise","I\u2019ll add to that, Jeff, that this market, in particular, we think the technology, innovation technology and clinical evidence is important to the clinicians, remains important to clinicians. So this product is not one that really competes on price per se, it\u2019s competing on the performance that is going to give the clinician and that\u2019s where we are getting a very positive response from our customer base.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","Bret, do you think that will be true as you go into Europe then with it, especially into maybe Southern Europe and\/or Germany where the generics have maybe picked up some traction here recently?","Bret Wise","We have, speaking to Germany specifically, we have a very strong position with our premium products in Germany in both really all three systems, ASTRA TECH System, XIVE and ANKYLOS. And we\u2019ve done some preliminary launch with some of our KOLs and whatnot, it\u2019s been very well received. We anticipate we are going to get good uptick in Germany.","We had some very preliminary launches similarly in France and the U.K. which will kick up more in the second part of the year and so we\u2019ve seen very good response. So that aspect, I think, Jeff, we feel pretty comfortable with. Obviously, the markets of Southern Europe, Spain and Italy, the premium systems are not as strong a portion of those markets. There\u2019s a lot of local players, and that\u2019s really kind of dictated more by the structure of the market.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Derek Leckow for any additional or closing remarks.","Derek Leckow","Okay. Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. If you have other questions, I\u2019m available today for follow-up. Good-bye.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Derek Leckow","Thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss DENTSPLY International's third quarter 2012 results. Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and COO; and Bill Jellison, Senior Vice President and CFO. We'll have some prepared remarks and then we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have.","I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is also available for download on our website at www.dentsply.com. We have also provided a set of supplemental slides to accompany this call also available for download under the Investor Relations section.","Before we get started it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","As you can see in the release our results this quarter include a number of nonrecurring items under non-GAAP adjustments. Our comments on this call will focus on results including certain adjustments that provide operational insight beyond some distortion from these items. These items are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You will note that our earnings guidance is also presented on an adjusted basis.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise.","Bret Wise","Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call this morning. Today we're very pleased to report another record third quarter, with strong sales growth driven by acquisitions, but also internal growth across all of our major regions. Adjusted earnings growth was also double digit, which we viewed as a strong performance in light of a relatively weak global economic environment here.","Overall, looking at the market first, in our view, the global dental market in the third quarter was generally comparable to what we saw in the second quarter. The U.S. is stable, but not really robust at this point. Europe continues to be a mix of slow growth in the north and continued contraction in the south. Combined, the European market is probably flat, plus or minus at this point.","The rest of world markets, which as you know comprise as many different countries for us continues to be a mix of slow growth in the developed regions that we have in that category, and mid to in some cases double digit growth in most of the developing markets that we include in rest of world. Overall, I'd say the dental market is doing okay at this point, but it's not great.","Getting into details a bit, on our sales performance on an organic basis, it was notably better than what we view as the market growth at this point, across most geographic regions and also on most product categories.","Our total growth with precious metals was a positive 12.3% and without metal was positive 14.8%. This 14.8% growth was driven by acquisition growth which was a positive 15.4%, but also the internal growth which was positive 4.7%, giving us constant currency growth for the quarter at a little bit over 20%.","Our currency was negative by 5.3% and add of course straight headwind for earnings as we've discussed in our second quarter call, particularly with the weakening of the euro over the second and third quarter.","The 4.7% internal growth was spread pretty equally across the regions, with the U.S. up 3.9%, Europe up 5.2% and rest of world was up 5.1%. Also important this is the first quarter in six that the orthodontics business has turned around and done accretive drug growth consistent with our re-launch plans. And of course, we've discussed on numerous of these calls stating all the way back to the natural disaster in Japan in March 2011.","Internal growth ex-ortho in Japan was a positive 2.8%. So ortho added about 190 basis points to this quarter. Just as a reminder from our second quarter call, we did re-launch the orthodontics line in Europe late in the second quarter, so we were live in that market for the entire third quarter. In U.S. we went live in August in the third quarter, so the impact in this quarter was much less than the U.S.","For competitive reasons, we're going to get away from giving you precise information by region on orthodontics. However, for your purposes, you should assume that the impact of orthodontics was much greater in Europe this quarter than in the U.S., due to the timing of the re-launch execution as discussed here. And Chris is going to have some further comments on orthodontics in his prepared remarks as well this morning.","Lastly, on internal growth there's some important calendar implications for us this quarter impacting our measurement, meaning changes in shipping days, particularly for Astra Tech in September. Bill is going to cover this in more detail, but I think it's fair to say that the way the calendar happened to fall this quarter reduced our internal growth by more than a full percentage point.","From a product category perspective, our internal growth was highest in the dental specialties, followed by consumables, both of which were positive, and lab was slightly negative in this quarter. There is always a lot of interest about implants, where our growth was slightly negative in this quarter and again that's impacted by the calendar days timing that Bill is going to cover.","From an earnings standpoint, we're very pleased to see some expansion in our adjusted operating margins year-over-year this quarter. And that's despite having Astra Tech in the base, only for one month last year, and of course for all three months this year.","We view this as an important step forward in restoring our operating margins to the pre-acquisition levels that we saw over time, and we're pleased to see the margin expansion begin to emerge here, although it's small, it's only 10 basis points on an adjusted basis. We're also targeting some good operating margin improvement as we move forward, despite being in a slow growth market at this point.","The Astra Tech acquisition continues to perform well, although we would like to seeing a strong implant market at this point. The slower growth in the implant market is providing us with some opportunities perhaps flexibility actually to pursue synergies more quickly than we would have otherwise, if we've been in a different market circumstance at this point.","We're also pleased with the continued growth of our healthcare business. We now refer to that business as Wellspect. It was renamed in August of this year, and is performing well even in the midst of a slow growth economy.","To day we're focus of course on completing the integration, achieving the synergies, maximizing our digital portfolio and for the dental business realizing the benefit of being part of a much larger and focused dental products company.","So at this point, we feel pretty good about how we've successfully made our through a slow growth market at this point. We've been through many currency fluctuations. We've absorbed in orthodontics supply outage to essentially consume 5% of our revenue and we feel pretty good about how we've integrated the largest acquisition in our history.","But we do see a number of great opportunities going forward. Our product portfolio today is very strong as is our pipeline of products coming forward. We have good opportunities to improve margins as we continue to drive synergy opportunities from the integration but also in our base business as well. And we also believe that the broader dental market will gradually improve once job growth begins to take hold.","Lastly, looking at the outlook and as noted on our release, we're modifying our guidance slightly for the full year by increasing the low end of the range, such that the new guidance for full year 2012 is now $2.19 to $2.24.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark.","Chris Clark","Thank you Bret, good morning everyone. I'm going to take a few moments and provide some deeper insights into the recovery of our orthodontics business as well as a brief update on the Astra Tech integration efforts.","As Bret mentioned that we've now re-launched our orthodontics product line on a global basis, with the U.S. re-launch following that of Europe and the rest of the world.","In aggregate, the orthodontics business contributed the 190 basis points of internal growth on a global basis and also solid earnings improvements, both of which were inline with our internal expectations.","We are pleased with the number of very loyal customers that have come back to the business as a result of product availability, and by our sequential progression over the past couple of quarters. We've been saying that we expected to recapture about a third of lost share quickly and that is proven to be true and very much inline with our expectations.","One highlight that I'd like to mention from the past quarter was our European GAC Symposium in Lisbon last month, which was a significant gathering of our largest European customers and also had record international representation. We were very pleased with the positive tone of the customer base and the excitement regarding our plans and approach including our expanded investments in R&D which I commented on in last quarter's call.","Our focus now expands to the next segment of lost customers who will be much more difficult to recapture as a result of the competitive nature of the orthodontics market and also the aggressive actions that we anticipate from our competitors as they try to hold on to these former GAC users.","We anticipate an aggressive fight at the street level to gather back our customer base, really a battle on kind of an account-by-account basis over the next few years. We're helped in our efforts here by the strength of our brands and also by the goodwill that was created by our transparent approach through our customer base throughout the supply crises.","While we continue to believe that this will be a multi-year competitive effort to recapture our lost market share, our performance to date trajectory are in line with what we expected and we believe that orthodontics will continue to be accretive to our growth rate during the recovery process.","I'd now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts. In short, we continue to be pleased with the overall progress of the integration. We've now expanded our launch of the DENTSPLY implant organization to include Italy, Nordics, Benelux and the United Kingdom that's an addition to the launches in North American Iberia earlier this year. We're moving forward with other countries between now in early 2013.","Sales training continues to be a significant focus and we're pleased with the competency and also the confidence levels that the sales organizations are showing with the combined product portfolio.","Customer feedback to the combined organization and the integrated DENTSPLY implant's portfolio has been very positive, as was the reaction of the integrated DENTSPLY implants presence at the recent European Academy of Osseointegration Meeting that was held in Copenhagen earlier this month.","On the field integration activities, we're also proceeding on track with our headquarter integration efforts, and overall we're very much inline with our cost synergy assumptions. Moreover, the business is increasingly addressing strategic areas such as clinical research, key opinion leader management, research and development and strategic marketing really on an integrated basis rather than as two separate businesses.","We're very pleased with the level of collaboration and with the morale within the teams, as they clearly see the strength of the combined DENTSPLY implants organization and the significant market potential that we had moving forward. While the implant market may not be as strong right now as we might have hoped, the strategic and synergistic benefits of the acquisition and integration of every bit of what we expected and we remain very pleased with the progress.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail.","Bill Jellison","Thanks Chris. Good morning everyone. Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I would like to add a couple of additional comments. We believe the calendar had a negative impact on our sales growth by approximately 1 to 1.5 percentage points in the quarter due to two issues.","First, the third quarter of this year had one less selling day than the third quarter last year. But second, the month of September this year had two fewer selling days than it did last year, and September is the only month in the quarter that Astra Tech has included for the calculation of our internal growth. Since that is when it began being included in our consolidated financial statements last year.","So we believe on an internal growth that our internal growth rate of closer to 6% or closer to 4%, excluding ortho-Japan is more represented of the performance that we had in the third quarter of this year adjusted for days. This is only an estimate to allow you to better understand our results though for the third quarter.","And looking at our geographic mix of sale ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2012, the U.S. was 36% of our total sales. Europe represented 42% and the rest of the world was 22% of sales. Despite to recent weakening of the dollar within the quarter, we still were negatively impacted by a strong dollar year-over-year in the third quarter by 5.3 percentage points.","Our earnings per share were also negatively impacted by FX rates in the quarter, and the impact was probably in the range of about negative $0.01 to a negative $0.02 per share. And on a year-to-date basis it was approximately a negative $0.04 to $0.05 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect the fourth quarter impact of exchange to be a little bit better, but still negative, probably in the 2% to 3% range, both on sales and on earnings.","As Derek mentioned and as you can see in our earnings release in the quarter, this quarter included a number of items, which impacted our results. By excluding these items from our results, we believe the adjusted figures provide a more comparable picture of the company's performance, and most of the following comments exclude the impact of these items.","Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the third quarter of 2012 were 56.9% compared to 56% for the third quarter of 2011. When compared to the same period last year, the gross profit margin rate was positively impacted by improved pricing, foreign exchange rates and products mix.","SG&A on an adjusted basis was $256.7 million or 39.7% of sales ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2012 versus 38.8% in the prior year's third quarter. Astra Tech, which runs higher SG&A expenses than our base business has a negative mix impact on SG&A expenses as a percent to sales. However, next quarter this will be in both the current year and the base period, and will be more comparable on a year-over-year basis.","Operating margin rates based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 17.3% compared to 17.2% last year in the same period. Despite not having Astra Tech in two months of the base period, we were still able to begin to show some year-over-year improvements in the rate.","As Bret noted, our orthodontic business began to show year-over-year improvement, once again in the quarter after the negative impacts we experienced with our supplier that was impacted by the natural disaster in Japan, which occurred in 2011. While the year-to-date impact is still negative by approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share over last year, we expect this to be flat to slightly positive for the full year of 2012.","Net interest and other expenses in the third quarter on a reported basis was $12.9 million compared to $20.8 million last year in the third quarter. This reduction in expense resulted primarily from about $12 million of acquisition expenses associated with the closing of the Astra Tech transaction in last year's third quarter, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP EPS.","On an adjusted basis, this category is higher by approximately $4 million compared to last year in the quarter, which is primarily associated with higher interest expense as the financing for the acquisition was not in place for the whole third quarter of last year. Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 25%. However, there are tax adjustments reflected in the rate of both periods.","On an adjusted basis, our operating tax rate for this quarter was slightly over 23% compared to a slightly higher adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of last year. We believe that an adjusted operating tax rate of approximately 23% to 23.5% is reasonable, both for the balance of this year as well as for 2013.","We continue to work on our international structuring as we finalize some of the activities and impacts from our recent acquisitions. And we continue to expect some favorable impacts from these efforts, especially in the areas of improved cash flow and repatriation efficiencies.","Net income attributable for DENTSPLY International in the third quarter of 2012, on an as reported basis was $53.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared to $60.6 million or $0.42 per diluted shares in the third quarter of 2011. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $74.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share in 2012 compared to $66.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011.","Cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2012 was approximately $202 million compared to $255 million in the same period last year. Cash flow from operating activities though in the third quarter increased approximately 10% compared to the third quarter of last year.","Inventories increased in the first nine months of the year and supported the rebuilding of inventory for our orthodontics re-launch to support inventory levels during our integration activities and to support a couple of our other product lines. Cash flow was also negatively impacted by the timing of some tax payments that fell into the first half of this year.","Our capital expenditures were $65 million in the first nine months of the year with depreciation and amortization at $103 million. Inventory days were 111 at the end of the third quarter of 2012 compared to 109 days at the end of the third quarter of 2011, and 100 days at the end of last year.","Our accounts receivable days were 60 days, including slightly higher days for Astra Tech at the end of the third quarter of 2012 compared to 61 days at the end of the third quarter of 2011. And at the end of the third quarter of 2012, we had $56 million in cash and short-term investments and our total debt was $1.65 billion at the end of the third quarter.","Finally, as Bret stated, we are updating our earnings guidance for 2012. As you recall, our previous earnings guidance was $2.18 to $2.24 per share on an adjusted basis. As we look toward a yearend, we're comfortable now with guidance for earnings on an adjusted basis of $2.19 to $2.24 per diluted share.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And we'd thank you for your support. And we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Bret or Bill, what was the core implant revenue growth experience, excluding the effects of the shipping day variances? And if you could comment just on the trend you saw by geography, I guess on a core basis that would be helpful? And then, I know one of your competitors called out pretty abrupt market issue in Japan. How did your business fair in that region, and could quantify the size of your implant revenue in that market?","Bret Wise","Core implant growth for us was slightly negative as we said. If you'd looked at days adjusted it would have been flat maybe slightly positive. I think the trends are that the U.S. market continues to grow, the European market probably is not growing at this point, and then the rest of world category kind of varies by country. And also a lot of those markets sell products by tender, so there can be kind of one large time sales that can be disruptive.","Looking at the trends for us, the U.S. was our best market, Europe was next, rest of the world was the slowest market for us, but as you point out here that includes Japan where the market was disrupted by several events. Japan's not particularly large for us, probably Japan for the whole company is 4% of our revenue, and in our implant business it's probably around that plus or minus a percentage point or so. So they did have an impact on us in the rest of world category, but it's not really that significant as a percent of the total implant business.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","And then, Bill, could you give us an update on operating cash flow and CapEx expectations for the year, and should we anticipate CapEx to step down materially next year? And then, just what are your thoughts about capital redeployment in near term?","Bill Jellison","On the CapEx side of equation, I think that originally at the beginning of the year we said that CapEx spending was probably going to be in the $100 million to maybe a $120 million range. I think we've obviously looked at in number of those projects and some of that has been just taking time to actually get into the system and getting actually spent.","I'd say that instead of that range, it's probably going to be in maybe the $90 million to a $100 million range at this year. But some of those projects are obviously still in the scope. They'll probably get spent next year. I believe that if you look at kind of spend level, it's probably going to be incrementally, again, higher than it is this year. So probably closer to maybe the $110 million to $120 million level next year, although we've not really given any specific guidance on the yearend or our CapEx.","As it relates to cash flow, I think that we've got some good projects that are continuing to progress forward. We've built the inventories this year which have obviously had a negative impact on cash flow early on for a couple of specific reasons. I think that that's probably going to be reduced as we move forward over the next few quarters, as we ultimately get a couple of those areas back down to a level that we think is more appropriate. And I think that as we move toward the end of this year, we'll probably have again a strong fourth quarter cash flow.","Operator","We'll go next to Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Bret, I just want to kind of follow-up with some of your opening remarks. You seem to talk about the U.S. dental businesses sort of continuing to grow at a relatively anemic pace and you talk about Europe being flat. And yet, I kind of look at the same-store results or internal growth numbers, constant currency that you guys have put up and days adjusted, it seems like it's close to the mid-single digit.","And so I was wondering if you could just help us reconcile maybe what's enabling DENTSPLY to kind of grow, let's call it 300 to 500 basis points faster than the market. Is it a market share issue or is it something within your customer base? Any sort of color would be helpful?","Bret Wise","When you look at our internal growth this quarter at 4.7%, a 190 basis point of that is orthodontic, so something in the 2.5% to 3% range is kind of the organic growth rate. It would be higher on this days adjusted basis, but let's call it 2% to 3%.","I do believe that the global dental market is growing a little bit slower than that. Certainly, Europe is a little bit slower than that. But our business has been taking share in Europe for numerous quarters in a row. I'm not sure how far back I should go, but I think ex-orthodontics we've been positive 11 quarters in a row, which is in many ways remarkable, given the economic circumstances there.","Going back to 2008, 2009, we did increase and make some important investments in R&D. And we had been pretty transparent with investment community that was going to result in more new products coming out. Those products shipped in 2011, early 2012. They've been performing very well. I think they've been driving market share gains for us.","So we have been performing above the market across numerous regions, I didn't really give the U.S. here, but U.S., Europe and also rest of world categories, because of those new product launches as they've rolled out. So even as we anniversary those, we're still growing above market and I think it's still attributable to the new innovation we've brought out, not only 2011, but 2012 and what we're going bring out in 2013.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Bill, if I can maybe just follow-up with you regarding the FX commentary you made. I think you suggested in 4Q that you saw that FX would have about a negative 2 to 3 percentage point impact on the topline and earnings. Could you just give us a sense for what some of your currency expectations are that you're using than you're existing model to come to those assumptions?","Bill Jellison","Generally, when we make comments on the currencies moving forward, at least from a street perspective, we're talking about rates that are consistent with kind of where they're running right now. So that would include something in the euro range that's in the 1.29 to 1.32 kind of range, and I think that that's probably consistent. That will allow us to be about half of the impact roughly. We had a little over 5% of a negative impact in the third quarter that should reduce that to close to half of that level by the fourth quarter if those rates hold up.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Given that we've heard the commentary, it sounds a little bit more conservative in the last quarter. I wonder if you could give us an update on what you're seeing there with the regional breakout. Is this still a fairly isolated Southern European issue? Have you seen anything incrementally in the northern countries, some of the more centralized countries?","Bret Wise","I wouldn't characterize a commentary difference than they were before, if they came across that way, it wasn't intended. We're kind of seeing the same market development in Europe that we've been seeing for the last several quarters.","The third quarter is always a little tough for Europe, because there is some extended vacation periods and so forth, so the entire market seasonally slows down in the third quarter. So you kind of focus your view on what happens in September in that market. But we haven't seen really any dramatic change there. We see the countries in the North continue to perform reasonably well in that environment, not robust growth, but growing, and we see the countries in the south still contracting.","So that market appears to be stable, but not a great level right now. And as I said before or on our prepared remarks, U.S. seems to be comparable to what we saw in the second quarter as well. So the global developed market, part of the global dental market seems to be pretty stable.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","And one, on your comments around the med-tech tax is it still the view that we think we can pass that through here in the U.S. with some sort of adjusted approach to the market going into 2013?","Bret Wise","The med-tech tax the timing of this is getting close here, the law goes into effect January 1, 2013. There's been no guidance on implementation yet issued by the administration, and some guidance is needed here. But we're kind of operating under the belief that it will go live, despite there is some pretty widespread opposition in Congress due to the impact on job creation and innovation. And of course, there is always some chance that something will happen in the lame-duck session. But we're doing our planning as if that's going to go live. We're going to be implementing price increases January 1.","We think those price increases were largely offset the medical device tax. I mean, there maybe some small leakage in one-line or another, but I don't think so this point. And we fully believe that our competitors will do the same thing and that cost, although it's small compared to the dentist, total cost will get pass through to the dentist.","So we're starting to belief that it will go effective and that probably go effective without implementation guidance by the way. It will go effective, and we're going to implement price increases January 1.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger from William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair","I realize you don't normally give former guidance for '13, until the fourth quarter call. But any kind of early thoughts if you think about the puts and takes. It seems like maybe a tougher macro-environment but also a better contribution from orthodontics, and perhaps Astra integration. Do you think you will be able to deliver better earnings growth perhaps in '13 versus what it looks like you'll get in '12?","Bret Wise","Well, John, as you noted in beginning of your comment, we're just entering our planning stage for next year. We do our budget planning throughout November, and we kind of arrived at an outcome and targets for next year, kind of, mid-December.","So I don't want to bypass that process anyway. You did raise couple issues in your comments here. The orthodontics will be a factor next year, because it was the pretty large drag in the first half of 2012, although, we're getting earnings growth from orthodontics now in the back half.","And the integration, of course, will be proceeding perhaps even at an accelerated pace as we enter 2013. So those are both important points for us to consider. Also important is our new product launches coming up, as well as, whatever currency impact we'll have on the business in 2013. I don't know Bill, do you have any thing to add at this point on the planning for next year.","Bill Jellison","No, I mean I think at this stage we obviously don't give any kind of directional guidance for next year until we release earnings. So I think Bret's comments are solid.","There is obviously a number of things that we believe that we have at least driving our business that should allow us to continue to get growth above and beyond broader market level growths. And we think that those positive factors should hopefully have some benefits for us as we move forward, but we won't give any kind of official guidance until we get into the next year.","John Kreger - William Blair","Maybe as a follow-up can you just expand a bit more on what you're seeing in the orthodontics market as you fully re-launch your product line. Have you seen slowing in that broader market environment given the tough macro-environment or has that held up better than the implant market and what sort of pricing changes are you seeing from your competitors as they try to hold on to that share that they took from you guys in the past year?","Chris Clark","In terms of us having a read on the case start trend if you will, I'm not sure we're going to be the best parameter of that, because again obviously any change in that is going to pretty well muted on based on what we see in the context of our numbers with the recovery of bringing the most loyal customers back that we've gotten over the last couple of quarters.","I mean, my sense is that it probably is a bit slower directionally, but in terms of real read on that, I think there is so much noise probably in our orthodontics numbers that that's going to be tough for us to tell or get more specific on. In terms of pricing, I think, maybe as I characterize my comments, we've gotten really the first third if you go back, pretty much as expected, maybe a little bit faster than expected.","We do think that the next third is going to be more challenging in part, because of pricing and promotional activities from competition and there is no doubt that we're going to have to be aggressive to go after that. So I think that we're viewing this really as a prolonged street battle, and again, I think our team is up to it, but I think it's going to take us a while here for this next stage.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Brett, I know you don't want to go 2013 guidance, let me just ask a couple of questions here on maybe fourth quarter guidance. You come up against your first of a couple of very tough U.S. organic growth comps. I've talked to you guys over the last few months, it sounds like those new products that launched a year ago, kind of build a new base in business, so should we be looking at that U.S. organic comp as a big headwind or you should still be able to grow inline or above market after the higher base of those new product sales?","Bret Wise","We are coming up against two quarters where we are above 7% growth in the U.S., so we do have a very strong base there. But as you point out, the portfolio is expanded with these new products, and that's why we had that accelerating growth last year. So these products are now still growing albeit not quite at the pace they were then obviously. So it is a high baseline but we believe we can grow over that baseline and continue to deliver above market growth despite having a very tough comp to come up against for the next several quarters.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","And Bill, I know you don't typically or you don't you like to guide on the margin at all, but the fourth quarter last year was kind of the big margin hit down the 16% on adjusted operating basis. It was down I think 400 basis points, if I remember. Good margin this quarter even with Astra Tech in there, you were able to go up year-over-year by 10 bips. Should we be thinking about a strong like 100 to150 basis points expansion next quarter or am I too aggressive in those thoughts?","Bill Jellison","You're right, Jeff. We really don't get into kind of the specific operating margin improvements on a quarterly basis, but I think that we're obviously with our year end guidance. You know exactly what our guidance must be now for the quarter itself. So I think that you can probably kind of build into that based on kind of the expected growth levels that we're going to have for the overall business.","But I think it's at least fair to say that we've had a couple of different comparisons that are in those numbers, both with orthodontic business as well as with not having Astra Tech in our base. So at least now on a comparable basis year-over-year period, you should at least get a better picture of kind of what that's looking like and how we're positioned moving forward.","Bret Wise","I would add to that we're very focused on operating margin expansion. And you saw that in our prepared remarks here, despite not having Astra Tech in filling the base, this is the first quarter we got some operating margin expansion post acquisition. And in our prepared remarks we intended to indicate that we're very focused on operating margin expansion going forward. So it's high on our list to priorities at this point.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Then last two, just quick follow-ups here for me. One, on the Japan dental implant issue, is that just an extension as we've heard of some of the issues in Korea about a year ago or so, just the media reports and things like that, or is there something structurally that could really suppress Japanese dental implant market for an extended period of time.","And then last question, just on the med-tech tax, and I've heard from a few of my guys out there in the field that there could be a chance here that dental gets excluded completely from the med-tech tax. There is some legislative effort to at least underway on that. And I refer to this high as maybe as 50% chance that's happening or that could happen, any thoughts from your end?","Bret Wise","Jeff, first on the Japanese issue there was a little bit of a media flurry that was kind of anti-dental implants. And that did impact the growth here in the short term. I expect that to play its way through like that as happening in other markets with other products. There is inherently dangerous about dental implants, but it is a market where you need good research, you need some good clinical evidence. It takes a lot of clinical education which is expensive and many times it takes a direct sales force that can support the doctor.","We have heard theories that dental implants don't no longer require that support and thus people should just cutout the customer support and drop the price. I don't think that's a formula for success in this market. This is a complicated surgery, and it requires that clinical support for the customer with the doctor to get good patient outcomes. So as far as Japan we think it will place it way through, but it might reinforce the need for good, strong clinical education behind these brands, behind these products.","With respect to the med-tech tax, I don't want to go too deeply into that but there is always a possibility that there could be carve out for dental. I mean, dental wasn't covered in the coverage of the new healthcare law yet, isn't enough paying the tax which is kind of a disconnect. Other areas of healthcare that didn't have coverage in the act like hearing or vision were exempted, from the tax.","So there is a lot of talk in Washington about getting something done on that. Getting things done in Washington in not easy even in a normal environment. I think it's particularly difficult right now. We'll have to see what happens in lame-duck session.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","I just want to ask with regards to the implant market, what you've seen, how this is done globally? And what are your just general expectations for the implant market going forward?","Bret Wise","I think the implant market has probably slowed a bit. We've only got two competitors that have reported, one did a pre-release report. And so we're still waiting on a couple of companies to report to really have a full view of what the market is, but our guess is that market has slowed kind of sequentially here. Third quarter was not a great quarter to evaluate it, because dental implant market is more mature in Europe and Europe takes extended vacations in the third quarter. But if we had to guess, we'd say it's slowed a little bit.","It is an expensive procedure. It's a discretionary procedure, and it's entirely possible that as the economy recovers that dental implants will start to grow more rapidly. We saw that in the early signs of recovery, maybe a year ago dental implant accelerated. And I think that would be true again if we saw some economic improvement over the coming months or quarters that we would see the same thing happening at dental implants.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Just to ask also, I see the U.S. sales were very strong internally this quarter. I just wanted to know are those sustainable? Do you think that those can be that robust going forward?","Bret Wise","Our U.S. sales growth I think was 3.9. I think that's actually in some ways a little bit slower than we had like, for instance fourth quarter last year and first quarter this year. U.S. market to us looks like its performing pretty stable with what we saw in the second quarter. We'll know more of course, when the distributors report in the coming weeks.","But I think from our perspective, we see the portfolio we have and we see how the products are performing versus the market. We're continuing to take share in that market in the U.S. market. And thus, we believe basically whatever happens with the market we can continue to grow at a premium to that.","Operator","We'll go to Scott Green from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First, I had one on the med-tech tax. So are you assuming any pre-buying ahead of that, normally you get some pre-buying ahead of normal rate increases, and maybe this one is even more in the news, just curious about your thoughts there?","Bill Jellison","It's entirely possible that as we communicate our price increases to the distributor channels, entirely possible that some distributors will want to buy ahead of that price increase, and thus have that margin enhancement program or opportunity for them. It's too early for us to tell. We've kind of incorporated in our range. We're sitting over the $0.05 range for the fourth quarter, which is a little broader than we normally have.","So with the high end of that range, that would probably encompass some buy-ahead on the med-tech tax issue and the price increase issue that we're going to implement. But at this stage, I think it's too early to tell. We probably won't know for sure what that's going to look like till we get well into December.","Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then can you elaborate on implant growth, just curious, you talked about you've re-launched the new DENTSPLY implants brand earlier in U.S. and Spain, and now Italy, U.K. What impact of that have when you re-launch on growth in those markets. Are you seeing a positive benefit from that, just on that new brand campaign?","Bill Jellison","No, I wouldn't characterize it that way. I am going to make a comment, and Chris has been closer to this than I, so he may have some further comments.","But when we launched DENTSPLY implant, what it means is we're launching the integration meaning bringing the two organizations together. Frankly, that's more disruptive than helpful versus market growth. We end up changing rep territory. We pull reps out of the field to train them. We end up changing the product packaging et cetera and the CE set up changes as well.","The clinical education setup kind of changes as well. So I think what you see with this launching DENTSPLY implants meaning from market-to-market, it's not really a boost to growth. It's almost more of an interruption, but that's where we're getting the synergies. That's where we're bringing the organization together to try to harvest the synergies from the acquisition. So I think its important stuff. Chris, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.","Chris Clark","I characterize it, Scott, as a kind of short term distraction. The necessary short term distraction for the reasons Bret mentioned. I mean, you've got the new reps with new things in their bag, new product in the bag, but they have to learn new territories, in many cases new boss, new managers in many cases.","But the fact you kind of go thorough that because of the significant potential, obviously with mine organization. I think that what we're really excited about is just the positive reaction of our people, but also of our customer base to that combined portfolio and that combined business. And so again, I think that the necessary distraction, the short term to get the long term gain or medium term gains, and it's pretty much playing out very much as we expected.","Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then I think the last quarter you suggested that inventories would decline in the back half for the year, and I think they were up again modestly in the third quarter. Just curious if you could update us on that and how you see inventories in the field as well, that the dentists are holding?","Bill Jellison","Sure. I think two things there. So first of, in the quarter-to-quarter, at the end of the second quarter we had about 111 days. We actually still had about 111 days at the end of the third quarter. We're still obviously kind of in the midst of ortho re-launch and obviously some of the integration activities, and some of the new ones that Chris, just talked about.","I'd say that it's probably still going to take us a few quarters to get the inventory backed down to kind of where we'd really like to have to in place. From a dealer perspective or the amount of inventory asset dealer levels, actually that inventory level is down year-over-year somewhat. So there is no increase in dealer inventory levels over the last year.","Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And lastly is there a way you could characterize 2013 in terms of product launches as stronger than normal or an average year or right at the normal?","Bill Jellison","The 2013 is IDS year, so in March we'll have the International Dental Show Germany. That's usually a show where we kind of accelerate product launches, for because we have access to that group every two years. So 2013 could be kind of slightly better than a normally year, I would say.","Operator","At this time we have no further questions. Mr. Leckow, I would like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing comments.","Derek Leckow","Well, thank you everyone. That concludes our conference call today.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Derek W. Leckow","Thank you very much, Mark. Thank you, all, for joining us this morning to discuss DENTSPLY International's fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 results. Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and COO; and Bill Jellison, Senior Vice President and CFO. We'll have some prepared remarks, and then we'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.","I hope you all had a chance to review the press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is also available for download on our website, www.dentsply.com. We've also provided a set of supplemental slides to accompany this call, also available for download under the Investor Relations section.","Before we get started, it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements, including risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements reflecting events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","As you can see in the release, our results this quarter included a number of nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP adjustments. Our comments on this call will focus on results, including certain adjustments that provide operational insight, excluding these items. These items are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. We'll also note that our earnings guidance is also presented on an adjusted basis.","With that, I'd like -- now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret W. Wise","Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our year-end call this morning. Today, we're very pleased to report record sales and earnings for both the fourth quarter and also the full year 2012. Before we dive into the results, I think it's important to take a look back at what the goals and initiatives were we had coming into the year and how we did against those.","So as you recall, on the same call last year, we had several important goals that we needed to achieve in 2013. Most notably, those were to continue to grow organically above the market, to have a successful midyear relaunch of our orthodontics product line, to reach our goals in the integration of Astra Tech, while continuing to grow above market in the premium implants segment, and to have strong cash flow generation for debt reduction during the year. In addition, we had forecasted that our operating margins would lag in the first half of the year but would turn positive in the back half of the year.","All told, I think we did very well against these objectives in 2012. For the full year, internal growth was 4.0%, which we believe is at least a full point above the market. A strong execution on new products launched in both 2011 and 2012 contributed to this, as well as the strategic investments that we've made in sales and marketing resources. In orthodontics, we did relaunch the line midyear and we recaptured what we estimate to be about 1\/3 of the market share that we had lost following the natural disaster in Japan. Our orthodontics boosted our internal rate -- growth rate by 150 to 160 basis points in both the third and fourth quarters, while for the full year, it was basically neutral to the overall results.","On Astra Tech, by the end of the first quarter 2013, we will have essentially completed phase 1 of the Astra Tech integration, which is the most disruptive part of the integration, by merging the 2 divisions and their sales forces in approximately 20 countries. We knew that this would create risk and it would be disruptive to our customers and our employees, and we would have the rest out of the field for training, et cetera, during this period of time. However, the execution so far has been very good, in my view, and we continue to perform above the market despite this disruption.","On our capital structure, we did complete one very small acquisition late in the fourth quarter and completed some share repurchases earlier in the year. However, the lion's share of our cash flow in 2012 went towards improving the balance sheet. We made good progress on this throughout the year, including the fourth quarter where we had very strong cash flow generation, in fact, a record quarterly operating cash flow generation for the company. At this point, we're already closing in on our longer-term leverage ratio targets, and I expect we'll bring these down further in 2013, but we now also have more flexibility for acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders.","With respect to profitability, we also performed very well, attaining operating margin expansion we were looking for in the back half of the year, and that culminated in a 110-basis-point improvement in Q4 versus the prior year's fourth quarter.","So looking back, we did a lot of things well in 2012. One thing that we did not anticipate at the beginning of the year was the significant midyear weakening of the euro. As noted, beginning in our Second Quarter Call, this had a negative impact on our earnings in the back half of the year and, in total, cost us approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share for the year versus where we started.","Shifting to some of the numbers. As I mentioned, our internal growth for the full year came in at 4.0%, well above what we believe the market grew for dental consumables. X ortho and Japan, by the way, was essentially the same, at 3.9%. Internal growth for the full year was the highest in the Rest of World category at 7.2%. We had 3.6% in the U.S., and Europe was 2.6% for the full year.","In the U.S., we had pretty good growth momentum despite facing some big comps in the second half of the year. And Europe, at 2.6% for the year, is essentially -- it's certainly well above market, and we've been running very positive in Europe for -- with positive internal growth, x ortho and Japan, for the last 12 quarters despite the severe economic disruption that we see in that region.","For the full year, both our specialties and our chairside consumables came in at mid-single-digits internal growth, while non-dental was low-single-digit growth and lab was essentially flat.","Just quickly, looking at the fourth quarter. Internal growth was 5.9%. That was boosted by orthodontics but was still 4.3% x ortho, which I think is still very good and above market. Regionally, the U.S. was 5.9%, Europe was 3.1% and Rest of World was 12.1%. Although we're not going to be real specific, the increase from ortho benefited each region somewhat the same, if you want to model it.","In the U.S., we had both really tough comps in the fourth quarter. We had over 7% growth in the fourth quarter of the prior year. And we also did see some disruption on the East Coast from Hurricane Sandy, which was quite pronounced in our regional growth numbers on the East Coast following the storm. This was offset somewhat by some slight buying-ahead by our distributors in the U.S. in front of the January 1 price increase. Although, we think this activity was probably much less for consumables than it was for equipment. In Europe, our new product portfolio continues to drive growth well above market. And in Rest of World, particularly the emerging markets, did very well for us in the fourth quarter. However, it's important to note that we had a fairly easy comp in that region coming out of last year.","From an adjusted earnings perspective, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased to see operating margins improved 110 basis points in the quarter, which is particularly encouraging giving -- given that we brought inventory down substantially in the quarter and boosted cash flow. Adjusted EPS was up 9.8% in the quarter and finished the full year at $2.22, also up 9.4%.","Looking ahead, we continue to see good opportunities for our new innovation, including a pretty robust pipeline. And we believe we'll continue to have very strong opportunities for growth in the emerging markets. I will ask Chris Clark to comment on both these opportunities here this morning in a minute. We also are very focused on operating margins and cash flow for 2013, and we believe we can return to a more regular pattern in both of these important measures.","For 2013, we believe we have another strong year built off the points I've mentioned here. There obviously continues to be risks in the underlying economies, particularly in Europe and the euro, while currencies in general are very volatile. Based on the conditions we see today, we're targeting adjusted earnings in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 per share for all of 2013.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris for his comments on emerging markets and the innovation pipeline. Chris?","Christopher T. Clark","Thank you, Bret, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take a few moments and provide some deeper insights into our strategies to drive continued above-market growth in emerging market regions, as well as an update on our new product pipeline, including highlights to some of our early 2013 launches.","We're very pleased with our progress in emerging market regions, which have really been a strategic focus area for us for the past couple of years and now account for approximately 15% of our revenue. In 2012, these regions delivered double-digit internal growth. And while these countries are obviously among our fastest-growing markets, we believe we are growing faster than the dental consumables market in these countries in aggregate. Importantly, our emerging market growth is accretive to each of our major product categories, and we're generally pleased by the breadth of our performance in these markets.","Our approach to these markets continues to be focused on expanding sales representation in commercial resources, particularly in the fastest-growing markets; strengthening our organization in these countries to drive and support future growth; and increasing our use of dual-branding approaches. Our investment in sales and marketing resources leverage our existing selling and distribution infrastructure and should allow us to move beyond the very premium segment of these markets and into the next layer of the emerging middle-class populations.","But I'd also like to specifically comment on the expansion of our dual-branding strategies, as this approach allows us to reach larger economic segments of these growing markets while minimizing the likelihood of reimportation back into the developed markets, namely the United States and Europe. We continue to expand our dual-branding platform in the chairside consumables area to encompass additional product categories and markets. In addition, this strategy is also playing an increasing role in our approach to these markets in the specialties area, with unique products that are commercially available only in emerging market countries.","So in short, we're continuing to find this to be an effective strategy that's expandable to other product categories.","I'd also like to comment on our innovation pipeline where these new products have been key catalysts to the -- to our above-market growth rate over the past couple of years. At this point, we're very encouraged by our pipeline for 2013, and we will be introducing or showing several of these products at this week's Chicago midwinter show or at the upcoming International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany, next month.","In the chairside consumables area, we're showing the NUPRO 5% sodium fluoride white varnish at the Chicago show this week, with shipments expected to begin next month. We have a patent pending on this unique white formulation that sets clear and has been shown to release significantly more fluoride than other leading products over a 2-hour period.","Also in the hygiene area, we're continuing to expand on the strong success of the RDH Freedom cordless hygiene handpiece with the introduction of NUPRO revolv disposable Contra angles that are designed with improved ergonomics for greater clinician comfort. These angles will first be available for traditional hygiene handpiece platforms, followed by the RDH Freedom platform a few months later.","In the endodontics category, we're introducing the next generation of nickel titanium files with ProTaper NEXT, designed with a patented off-center rectangular cross-section that provides a snake-like swaggering movement. This file is designed to be more efficient in debris removals and will also optimize shaping along the track of the canal. This design also uses -- utilizes our proprietary M-Wire nickel titanium material, which has greater cyclical resistance -- sorry, greater resistance of cyclical fatigue, which is the leading cause of file separation.","Finally, in the healthcare area, Wellspect HealthCare has introduced the new LoFric Origo compact male catheter. This instantly activated catheter provides several unique advantages that are preferred by patients and help to improve infection control. I would note that our LoFric Sense compact female catheter, which was introduced in 2011, is continuing to drive market share gains in that category, as our female catheter sales increased by almost 30% in 2012.","I will just close with a comment that we're overall quite pleased with the strengths of our new product pipelines, and I look forward to providing you additional updates on some of the exciting new-product launches throughout the year.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter and also the full year 2012 in greater detail.","William R. Jellison","Good morning, everyone. So Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter and the year, but I wanted to add a couple of additional comments regarding our sales.","The 2012 geographic mix of sales, without precious metal content, was as follows. U.S. represents 33% of sales, Europe was 45% this year and the rest of the world was 22% of sales. Although it's difficult to estimate, we also believe that the internal growth rate in the period may have been benefited by approximately 50 to 100 basis points from dealer inventory changes, including buy-in ahead of our January 1 price increase; an extra selling day, albeit it was only December 31; and the offsetting impact of Hurricane Sandy on the business in the northeastern United States during the quarter.","A strong U.S. dollar compared to last year in both the quarter and for the full year negatively impacted our sales by 2.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The effective changes in foreign exchange rates also had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share compared to last year for the full year of approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share, while the impact on the quarter was minimal. These impacts included benefit from layered currency hedges.","As Derek mentioned, and as you can see in our earnings release, the fourth quarter as well as the full year included a number of items which impacted our results, which we have identified as non-GAAP adjustments. To better understand and follow some of the following comments, you can look at the tables included in our recent press release, which reconciles performance from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP performance.","Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis, as a percentage of sales, ex precious metal content, in the fourth quarter of 2012 were 56.3% compared to 56.6% for the fourth quarter of 2011. When compared to the same period last year, this rate was negatively impacted by product mix, which mostly resulted from a higher level of orthodontic sales and the effects of a softer implant market. Manufacturing costs were also higher in the period. However, these costs were more than offset by improved pricing. On a constant currency basis, the gross profit mate -- rate would have been slightly positive, despite the negative mix impact or the higher orthodontic sales.","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were $276.2 million, essentially flat or 39.3% of sales, x precious metals, in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus 40.6% in the prior year's fourth quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved as we realized some expense synergies from our acquisition integration and as sales increased in our ortho business which was -- helped to offset or better leverage our overall SG&A expenses.","Operating margins based on sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis were 17.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 16% last year in the same period. Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was $11.1 million compared to $14.6 million last year in the fourth quarter. This reduction in expense resulted primarily from lower net interest expense as we continued to pay down the debt from our recent acquisition.","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was a negative 46% and is not really meaningful as there are significant tax adjustments reflected in the rate. The positive tax benefit booked in our fourth quarter results was a result of significant efforts by our tax team. We recently finalized a global tax structure and legal entity integration, after our recent acquisition, to support our broader international business. This structure helps to minimize future tax impacts and allows efficient repatriation of future cash flows. On an adjusted basis, our operating tax rate for this quarter was approximately 24.3%, or 2.3 percentage points higher than last year in the quarter, and ended the year at 23.4% compared to 22.8% last year. The tax rate was slightly worse than last year. However, it is expected to improve again in 2013 as we benefit from our tax restructuring efforts and reestablish tax benefits that became effective after the first of the year. We believe that a tax rate of approximately 23% or better is reasonable in looking at 2013, including an ability to efficiently utilize more of our foreign-generated cash flow.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the fourth quarter of 2012 on an as-reported basis was $126.8 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to $40.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. These results include a number of non-GAAP items, primarily including a significant tax benefit associated with our legal entity restructuring efforts, amortization and costs associated with restructuring and recent acquisitions.","On an adjusted basis, earnings were $81.4 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $72.6 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in 2012 for the full year was $314.2 million or $2.18 per diluted share and, for the 2011 base, was $244.5 million or $1.70 per diluted share. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an adjusted basis for the years ending 2012 and 2011 were $319.2 million and $290.9 million, respectively. This represents earnings of $2.22 per diluted share for 2012 compared to $2.03 in 2011, which was an increase of 9.4% for the year.","Cash flow from operating activities in 2012 was approximately $367 million compared to $393 million in 2011. Inventories increased this year to support the rebuilding of inventory for our orthodontic business. However, cash flow from operating activities increased approximately 21% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. As planned, both our inventory days and accounts receivable days improved from the third quarter levels. Inventory days were 106 at the end of 2012 compared to 100 days at the end of 2011. Increase in the number of days is primarily associated with the building of orthodontic product inventory as that supply was reestablished during the year. Accounts receivable days were 53 at the end of the year compared to 52 days at the end of 2011.","Capital expenditures for the year were $92 million, with depreciation and amortization of approximately $136 million. At the end of 2012, we had $80 million in cash and short-term investments. And total debt was $1.52 billion and net debt has been reduced to $1.44 billion.","In 2012, we repurchased approximately $39 million of our stock or approximately 1 million shares at an average price of approximately $39. Based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 14 million shares available for repurchase.","We believe a reasonably stable global economy in 2013 should allow the global dental market to once again show modest growth for the year. With a significant international footprint, our sales and earnings are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. The currencies which have the biggest impact on our sales for us are the European currencies, especially the euro. Our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the euro, Swiss franc and Swedish kronor and the Japanese yen. We utilize systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business. This helps to dampen the volatility between years.","For 2013, we expect a slight 1- to 2-percentage-point top line benefit from current foreign exchange rates. However, we expect a slightly negative impact on earnings per share in 2013 as our transaction hedges are expected to be less favorable this year.","Finally, as Bret stated, we are excited about our new product portfolio and we are confident in our ability to outperform the market. Despite the continued softness in the broader global economy, we are establishing 2013 earnings per share guidance at $2.38 to $2.48 per share on an adjusted basis. Also, it is important to note that the first quarter of 2013 will have 2 fewer selling days than in the first quarter of 2012, which will have a negative impact on the sales and earnings comparison in the quarter. However, an additional selling day in each of the following 2 quarters should offset this impact in our full year results.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support. And we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Steve Beuchaw, Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, just one clarification. Bill, I really appreciate the comment that you made where you tried to help us net out the impacts of inventory changes, the extra selling day and Sandy in the fourth quarter. Am I right that those 3 factors, in total, were a positive 50 to 100 basis point impacts on revenue? Is that right?","William R. Jellison","That's right. That's our best kind of estimate. It's kind of difficult with all the different moving pieces, but that should be an approximate range of that.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And that would -- I would think that would be disproportionately concentrated in the U.S. Is that also right?","William R. Jellison","A little bit more in the U.S., that's correct.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then I wonder -- just thinking about where we are in the calendar here, looking out on 2013. If you could spend a little bit of time, I guess this would be for Bret, on a couple of markets that we think about a lot and just talk to us about what you're expecting for a couple of these markets in particular. Number one would be dental implants. And then number two would be Europe, particularly in the north. These are markets that seem pretty stable here. Is that how you're thinking about them going into 2013?","Bret W. Wise","Sure, Steve. With respect to Europe, obviously, our results have been very stable in Europe for the last 3 years, really, since the end of the recession. We've generated positive internal growth in -- excluding the orthodontics disruption in each of those quarters. We think we've been well above market in each of those quarters. And as we -- for instance, as we look at our results this quarter by country, we see we had positive internal growth in every country in Europe, except for 2 countries in the south. So the indications we get from our results tell us that, that market's stable. It's still a growing market. It's not robust but it's one that's growing across the entire region. It has some places where there's still very difficult economic situations affecting the dental market, but overall, the European market appears stable and it appears to be growing slightly. Dental implants, we know now that all but one of the premium implant companies have reported. We think we're probably -- depending upon where this last company comes out, we're probably 2 to 3 percentage points better than the market on average, although the market is probably declining slightly at this point. We're kind of flattish at this point. I think 2013 can be a year this market could be flat to grow as low single digits. I don't see it getting a lot better than that in the short term, and that's kind of taken into account in our planning here.","Operator","And next is John Kreger, William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just hoping you might be able to expand a little bit more in your expectations for '13. What sort of price assumptions are you assuming in your guidance? And just curious if the med tech impact had much of an impact on that.","William R. Jellison","Sure. I think that, 2 things there. One, as you're aware, we typically get somewhere between 1 and 2 percentage points normal price. I'd say that, this year, from a broader basis, we are expecting obviously higher than that, partly because of the med tech tax that's out there, and we want to make sure that we're helping to offset as much of that as we can through this process. So I think that you should expect that, obviously, the price increases for the overall year are going to be north of 2% instead of under 2% this year.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then a follow-up. Can -- what is your view on how the preventative and restorative market is doing relative to your specialty markets? And curious what you think of the orthodontic markets doing in total at this point.","Bret W. Wise","I'm going to comment on preventive and restorative and let Chris comment on orthodontics. Looking at our results, those markets are kind of mid-single-digit growth markets, let's say, low- to mid-single-digit growth markets, depending on the specific product category, in the U.S; and probably low-single-digit markets for us, maybe closer to even less than that but still positive, in Europe. So those markets, which are the everyday-dentistry type markets, I think, are good indicators of traffic flow in the dental offertory. And they appear to be stable to growing, a little bit faster in the U.S., a little bit slower in Europe at this point. Chris, what do you have to offer?","Christopher T. Clark","On the orthodontics side, John, I would -- yes, I guess I would say the market -- we're probably not the greatest barometer right now in terms of reading the market obviously, because our results are skewed based on the recovery. So I think that would be -- it would be tough to look at our numbers and project that back in the market. What I would say is, I think it's a pretty competitive market situation right now, with not a whole lot of growth; I would say, flat to maybe up slightly in terms of this growth. And obviously, we're doing better than that as we're growing through the recovery.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And Chris, have your thoughts changed at all on your ability to recapture the lost share after the tsunami in Japan?","Christopher T. Clark","I think we're pretty consistent with what we said, John, earlier. I mean, I think, at this point, we think we've, again, probably gained back about 1\/3 of what we had lost and we're now focused on the next 1\/3 that is really a multi-year effort in terms of slugging it out at the Street level. Those customers have gone to competitors, and those competitors aren't give that -- give those up easily. And the remaining 1\/3, we may never get back. And obviously, over time, you need to offset that with -- look to offset that with other competitive gains of other competitive users. So I think that we're pretty much on-track relative to what we said, but I think that we're now reaching the stage where it's tough sledding at the Street level. And again, our team is up for it and -- but it's -- there's still a lot of work to do.","Operator","Next question today will come from Jeff Johnson, Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bret, I was hoping I can start with you, just on kind of your market comments around U.S., Europe and AP for 2013. We have seen just in the last few days some large med tech companies talk about kind of incremental softening in the European market to start this year; in the U.S., some of the retail data with payroll tax increases, and that's starting to soften up a little bit late January or early February. But do you still feel comfortable, it sounds like, that markets are somewhat stable at this point and dental can still grow this year across most of those major markets?","Bret W. Wise","Yes. I mean, I -- to me, it's a little too early to be trying to read the tea leaves on what's happened, for instance, in the last 5, 6 weeks. The markets, to us, do appear to be stable in the U.S. and in Europe, a little bit more robust in the U.S. than Europe, but stable in both markets overall. I think Bill had some comments here this morning about the way the calendar falls in the first quarter here, and I've seen 2 or 3 of our competitors comment on this as well. And that is that there's -- we're going to end up with 2 less shipping days this quarter versus a year ago. Thus, I think, when you see results come out for the first quarter across-the-board, they're going to be a little bit weaker for the quarter and then will be made up later in the year. But as far as the overall markets go, to us, they appear to be stable, with no meaningful changes at this point.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And Bill, I guess, a question for you, just on FX. I mean, since the Astra Tech deal, it seems like most of your top line impact, if it's 1% to 2%, this year positive. Historically or over the last year or 2, we think that mainly flows through to the bottom line then at anywhere from 50% to 100%. This year, it's turning around exactly the opposite and going to be a drag. And I guess I just don't quite understand why that is.","William R. Jellison","Sure. Just to go back and talk about kind of what we had stated when we first did the transaction: We did a more consistent kind of FX-related, transaction-related hedging program where we're laying in ring -- layering-in hedges each and every month that take us out kind for the next 18 months. And as you kind of look at the impact, the whole purpose of that hedging process is to ultimately dampening -- dampen what the otherwise impact would be on FX. So if you take 2012, for example, the top line was impacted by, let's say, 3.8, 4 percentage points. If you took that on our total earnings, the impact last year would've been more in the $0.08- or $0.09 related impact. Our FX-related hedge ring -- hedging helped dampen that impact. But we now don't have that same level of benefit of those hedges in 2013. So in essence, the impact of last year's hedging -- FX movements actually are spread, in essence, over kind of that 2-year period. So we aren't getting the full positive benefit on the bottom line this year because of that positive benefit that we had on the FX hedges in 2012.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just to clarify, you actually said it would be a negative, I mean, so we should think of EPS being flat, if not dragged down a little bit by currency this year, even though the top line will be a slightly positive impact.","William R. Jellison","Yes, based on where rates are at right now, something kind of in that flat to a couple-cent negative impact is kind of what we would be expecting.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right, fair enough. And then Chris, just I guess, last question for you, just on new products. We've heard off and on some rumors about potentially you guys getting a little more serious on the digital impression side. And I've also heard some progress has been made on the cobalt chrome side, which -- the millable cobalt chrome side, which to me would be a sizable potential new product this year. So wondering if you can comment at all or if you're willing to comment at all on either of those.","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. I guess what I'd say, Jeff, is we got launches obviously coming out throughout the year. We got some coming up obviously this week at the Chicago. I'm not going to comment on either of those in the short term. What I would say is, certainly on the cobalt chrome, that's a space that we're very interested in. We're interested in both spaces, but the cobalt chrome, you'll probably hear from us before the other. And again, I think that, that's -- that we're excited about what we got coming potentially down that path. And you'll hear from us probably in another call or so.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It sounds like you guys regained about 1\/3 of the lost share in ortho, which I believe was the portion that you had previously said you thought you'd recapture pretty quickly. Just as far as we look forward, how should we be thinking about, year by year, how you guys are planning on or thinking about recapturing that remaining lost share within ortho?","Christopher T. Clark","Robert, it's Chris. I guess I would say the -- again, the first 1\/3, I won't say it was easy, but bottom line is those were probably among our more loyal customers, certainly the first group coming back for the -- a few quarters ago. As you have product, you -- again, our bottom line, they would -- once we have product, they were very interested in coming back. Now Obviously, most recently, we're having to get to that next year where we will have to work a little bit harder for it. And yes, it's pretty consistent with what we said we thought we'd see. This next 1\/3, I would probably say that's going to take 3 years-ish. It's a multiyear effort. And again, we're having to slug it out against competitors that have done what they can to try to load up end users and certainly offer inducements to try to keep those customers. So they're former customers of ours. They're positively predisposed towards our line, but in the short term, they've been obviously taken care of by somebody else. And we're going to fight it out. And again, I'm confident, over time, we'll be successful with that, but that's not going to be quite as quick. Obviously, as we go against the next couple of quarters, we have a little bit of a lower base. And again, the trajectory again improved on orthodontics throughout last year, but I think the sequential trajectory probably is not going to be as significant as what we've been seeing the last few quarters.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's really helpful. And then if I could just cite one more another organic factor, if you will, as we try to think about our forecast. I know Astra Tech, in the synergy guidance, I think you guys have stopped updating it. But even just directionally, I know, year 1, you had originally outlined $0.12 to $0.17. Curious just if you'd be willing to share how you compare to that. And I know you're 3 -- initially, you were thinking somewhere in the $0.30 to 40% -- $0.40 range. I was just wondering kind of, even if it was more qualitative, just how you guys feel you're tracking relative to those synergies.","Bret W. Wise","Sure, Bob, I'll try to give you just some high-level comments there. With respect to the original first year guidance, we've already confirmed that we were within that range and felt pretty good about the transaction. The synergy estimates that we had and are using internally look solid. And we're going after those synergies, so I think we're going to get further earnings accretion from that. The thing that's probably a disappointment to us is the global premium dental implant market today is probably flat to slightly down. At the time of the acquisition, we probably would've thought it'd be growing mid single digits at this point. So that puts a little bit of weight on the third year earnings accretion target. However, that's why we used a range, because we knew we wouldn't be correct in all of the assumptions. And at this point, we're not going to confirm or update that guidance anymore, but I'll say that, absent the slowness in the market, we feel pretty good about the targets that we set for ourselves at the time of the transaction.","Operator","Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse has our next question.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bret, maybe if I can just kind of follow up on that last question. So it sounds like you think Astra's going to be a slight benefit next year because -- what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to reconcile all the sort of components that you've baked into your 2013 guidance. It kind of sounds like currency is sort of negligible. Ortho, Bill, I don't know if you're willing to sort of quantify in some way what you think that incremental benefit in '13 to be. Because if I sort of triangulate all these different components, it kind of feels like, Bret, you're saying that we're still expecting kind of that low-single-, maybe approaching mid-single-digit growth sort of globally in the dental business. Is that a fair characterization?","Bret W. Wise","Glen, we don't give guidance on internal growth for the year. We did give a little bit of insight here on the first quarter because the calendar is affecting us so much. However, we've been growing kind of 3% to 4% in this environment for some time. We commented earlier we see the markets as stable at this point. We don't see any major disruptions to the markets, and I think you should use that in your comps or in your modeling to the extent you see fit. With respect to Astra Tech, because even in a no-growth market we have synergies to after, we think that Astra Tech can continue to be earnings accretive as we improve the cost structure and so forth in 2013, even without implant market growth. So I don't know if that helps you or not, but that's the guidance we'd be willing to give at this point.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, yes, no, that's fine. And so maybe I could just follow up on that, I mean, how should we think about margins then in 2013, I mean, assuming for a second that, that revenue growth stays in this approximate range while margins have been stable the past couple of quarters, obviously down a little bit from what we've seen historically? And I'm wondering how does a company, absent any major mix shift, how can the company expand its margins in this current revenue environment? Are there leverage you can pull to do that?","Bret W. Wise","Well, there are. New product innovations is the most important one because we usually get a margin lift from new product introductions that come out of -- at higher prices. So I think that's one. Number two is, we're looking at the cost structure to make sure that we have the most efficient cost structure possible. That will help 2 things that go against this year. Early in the year when we're short those 2 days -- those 2 shipping days, that'll be harmful to our operating margins, of course, in the first quarter. And as ortho -- just as an aside, as ortho becomes a larger percent of the portfolio again, ortho has carried a little bit lower margins than our other dental consumables because we're not the manufacturer. So that's a small headwind. The last thing I'll throw in here is that the medical device tax, although it's boosting our top line a little bit, we're essentially collecting tax and giving it to the government. So there's no income at the operating margin line even though revenue is higher, so that puts a little bit of pressure on operating margins on a percentage basis. All told, though, we've said before and we're willing to live by and state again here that we're looking to return to a more normal operating margin improvement pattern year-over-year, as we see -- we saw pre recession and pre the orthodontics events in 2011. So our guidance there is we look for 20 -- I think it's 20- to 40-basis-points improvement per year. And we're reestablishing those expectations now with the new baseline that we have.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bret, maybe if I could just squeeze one last one in. And I'm kind of curious. In the press release, you stated that you feel like the balance sheet is in a better place now and maybe the company can reengage in some capital deployment priorities, and you specifically called out acquisitions. And so could you maybe give us a sense for maybe what may be specific areas of interest for you, looking to expand the product portfolio? Or is it more sort of expanding the geographic presence?","Bret W. Wise","Well, our acquisition program looks at both breadth of the portfolio and the scope, the geographic scope, of the portfolio. So we target companies for technology, for brands and for geographic reach. In the latter case, it's usually sales and marketing reach. We're not ready to announce any acquisitions at this point, but the acquisitions that we do over the next couple of years, I think, will be in that category. And as you know, in dentistry, most transactions are small, so we expect most to be in kind of a tuck-under zip code with respect to magnitude. But the -- we do have more acquisitions in our pipeline that we're working on. Timing is always difficult to predict. But I think that, with the balance sheet improving and as it's going to continue to improve here in 2013 -- or we expect it to improve in 2013, we're going to be in a much better position to start doing those transactions again this year.","Operator","Jason Rogers with Great Lakes Review has a question.","Jason Rogers","Could you give a comparison of the internal growth specialties versus consumables versus lab for the quarter?","William R. Jellison","Yes, I can give you that in a high level here. For the fourth quarter, our consumables were up mid single digits. Specialties were up high single digits. Lab was slightly negative, primarily because of decline in precious metal alloys in Europe. And non-dental was up mid single digits.","Jason Rogers","Okay. And would you provide your CapEx estimate for 2013?","William R. Jellison","I think that, going into 2012, we actually were expecting that we were going to be spending higher capital expenditures on a couple of different programs. Some of those got kind of kicked out a little bit from a actual spend perspective. But as we look at 2013, you should expect that our overall CapEx is more in the range of kind of what we were looking at for last year, which is probably in the $120 million, $130 million range.","Jason Rogers","Okay. And then looking at the catheter business, just wanted to get some commentary on how that's performing.","Bret W. Wise","The catheter business, which we've renamed and rebranded Wellspect HealthCare, it's -- we've got it set up as a separate division in the company now with separate resources and focus, et cetera. And it's performing very well: very strong in the U.S.; strong in Europe, although the market there is not quite as robust as it is in the U.S. And our performance there has been driven off of new innovation. We have a new female catheter that was launched during the -- I think, about 18 months ago, 2011. It's been growing rapidly. And just this month -- or excuse me, just last month, January 2013, we launched a new male catheter. And early indications are that, that's a really strong product as well. The early feedback from customers is that we're going to have good uptake on that as well. So the business is performing well, it's meeting our expectations and it looks to be a good part of our portfolio.","Jason Rogers","And then finally, the -- you talked about strength in emerging markets. Are you seeing any strength in the specialties category? Or is it mainly in just everyday dental products?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, we're seeing pretty solid strength at really across the various categories. Obviously, that's kind of been a little bit -- based on the markets, there's 70, 80 countries here so it's kind of hard to generalize, but I guess I would categorize that we're pleased with the performance in the emerging markets specialties, as well as on consumables and also, to a degree, on labs. So again, I think that it's relatively broad.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jon Block, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe just the first one, another follow-up on orthodontics, if you would. Can you tell us about just how it's going to be staged throughout the year, maybe more from an earnings perspective? In other words, I know you've sort of brought back from the first 1\/3, but do you still think it's going to be accretive by about $0.05 '13 versus '12? And then, Bill, would that primarily show up in 1Q, 2Q because of the relaunch that you had sort of in the back half of 2012?","William R. Jellison","I think, from an ortho perspective, we would still expect to see some improvement in 2013. I think the first quarter, as you mentioned, is obviously easier because it was negatively impacted still last year in the ortho business. However, keep in mind, that you also have the 2 lowers days in the first Q. So that's going to take a chunk of that away as well too, at least within that quarter. So we are expecting some improvement but probably not to the level, obviously, that we accomplished in 2012 with that business.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just as a follow-up there, do you think $0.05 benefit '13 versus '12 is a good number to use? Or is that a little bit too aggressive?","William R. Jellison","No, I'd say that, that's too rich.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second, just on capital allocation. It sounds like you've done a great job paying down debt. It seems like your leverage is right around 2.5. Is debt pay down still the main priority, you'd say, but you've got more flexibility on acquisitions? And also, should we expect share count, if you would, instead of just staying flat that maybe you'll actually take that down on an absolute basis '13 versus '12?","Bret W. Wise","I think, with respect to priorities, we are kind of rebalancing them a bit here. Debt reduction is still is of importance to us, and I think you'll see us allocate some of the cash flow towards debt repurchase. But also this year, I think you'll see more go through acquisitions and some through share repurchases also. What we've said over time is we want to kind of keep the share count neutral, at least from exercises of options and so forth. We haven't really caught up with that since we did the acquisition. We do have a large share buyback authorization available to us. And would -- I don't want to predict an exact amount to how many shares we'd buy back because I don't know, but I think that that'll be an element of the capital allocation this year.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then maybe the -- just a last one, Bret. Just your long-term thoughts on the implant market, maybe where it is today relative to where it was at the time of the Astra acquisition. And of course, you guys have done a great job and you're taking share in a more modest market, but has anything changed? I don't have the wording in front of me back at the Astra timing, but I think you were talking about maybe even a low-double-digit market. Do you still think that's attainable long term? Or has some stuff with what's been going on in Japan reined in the long-term expectations?","Bret W. Wise","That's a complex question. I think, back at the time of the acquisition, I don't have the wording in front of me either, but I think we said we thought it could a high-single-digit market again and probably a mid-single-digit market in the near term. And in fact, immediately after the acquisition, for, I don't know, 1 year or maybe 3 quarters, it did run kind of a mid single digit. And today, in the United States, it's running in that range, I would say, as well, probably mid to maybe even a little bit better than mid single digits for a market. Longer term, I think that dental implants are still well underpenetrated in the market. It's the best solution for a difficult ailment. It doesn't destroy adjacent teeth, et cetera. And so I think that, over the next couple of decades, dental implant therapy is going to be a major part of the restorative business in both -- in global markets, really, in all geographic markets. So I think that it's an area we needed to participate in, in a significant, meaningful way. And we believe we're now positioned to do that with a very fine portfolio of products and sales reach.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question will come from Yi-Dan Wang, Deutsche Bank.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I joined your call a bit late, so apologies if you've covered these already. I've got a couple of questions. First of all, on the dental implant business, can you comment on where DENTSPLY's organic sales growth were in a U.S. and x U.S. in the fourth quarter? And to what extent has the integration of Astra Tech impacted those numbers? And how should we think about this impact in 2013? And then the second question is, how big is DENTSPLY's CAD\/CAM business now? And how has it performed in 2012? And what are your expectations for that in 2013? And where is DENTSPLY in opening up its CAD\/CAM platform?","Bret W. Wise","Okay. I'm not sure I got all those down, so you guys are going to have to help me here. But with respect to dental implants, in the fourth quarter, we were slightly negative, which was entirely attributable to Japan. If Japan hadn't been in the mix, we would have been slightly positive in the quarter. Of -- we haven't seen all of the results from all the competitors. I think there's one that's still outstanding. But from the ones that we have seen, that would put us, I don't know, 300 basis points or so, maybe 400 basis points, faster than the others or in better shape than the others. With respect to geographic reach, we don't give that for each of our businesses, but I think it's fair to say that the U.S. was much stronger than Europe. And in the Rest of World category, Japan was the weakest and the other countries within the Rest of World category were stronger. With respect to our CAD\/CAM business at DENTSPLY, it's pretty complex because we have CAD\/CAM technologies in our implant business. We've got bars and bridges. We've got CAD\/CAM technology used in customized drill guides. We've got CAD\/CAM technology used in our prosthetics business, both for sale, meaning to labs, but also in centralized manufacturing. We have not rolled that up and disclosed that to anyone, but I think you should assume that our CAD\/CAM business is doing well. I'm not trying to hide the result, it's doing very well. But for us, it's a complex business across numerous of our franchises, and we have not rolled that up and disclosed that to people.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So just to cover some of the ones that I asked, the other ones I asked. So in terms of your dental implant performance, how has the integration of Astra Tech impacted those numbers? And how should we think about that impacting 2013?","Bret W. Wise","Well, I mean, I think, integrating a business, it's always difficult to tell what the impact is. What I can say is that we've gone through a year where we rearranged all the subsidiaries; we merged all the sales forces, we took the rest out of the field to the train them on the products from the other company. We've changed their bosses, changed their territories, many times changed their customer base. And we're growing, we think, 300 to 400 basis points faster than market. I don't know how much of that is due to the integration and how much of that is due to good execution, but we're...","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It sounds like the execution is very good so far. And you said that you will complete that integration at the end of Q1. So would you say that, if there were disruptions in your business, we would've seen it -- seen the worst of it already, or does -- we need to keep an eye out on that for a bit longer?","Bret W. Wise","Yes, what's going to be done by the end of Q1 is the merger of all the country organizations, which is a process that is -- well, it's the process that's most disruptive. What you'll see going forward is us going after cost and cost synergies and so forth, at the same time using the sales forces that are now merged and trained, cross-trained, on the products to generate sales synergies. I'm not real comfortable with characterizing what's more disruptive, but I would think what we've been through would be the most disruptive part of the integration.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, okay. And just on the CAD\/CAM business, are you able to talk about how open your CAD\/CAM systems are today? It seems that more of your competitors are pursuing that option.","Bret W. Wise","Almost all of our CAD\/CAM businesses and processes are open systems. There's one system, particularly in Europe, that's a closed system, but it's not a huge part of the business.","Operator","At this time, we have no questions in the queue. I will now turn the conference back over to Derek Leckow for any closing or additional remarks.","Derek W. Leckow","Well, thank you, everyone. That concludes our conference call today. We thank you for your interest in DENTSPLY. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact investor relations. Goodbye.","Bret W.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, sir. ","Derek Leckow","Thank you very much, John, and my thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s Q2 2012 results.  Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and COO, and Bill Jellison, Senior Vice President and CFO.  We will have some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","I hope you all had a chance to review our press release which we issued earlier this morning.  A copy of the press release is also available for download on our website at www.DENTSPLY.com.  We also provided a set of supplemental slides to accompany this call also available for download under the Investor Relations section.","Before we get started it\u2019s important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.   These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings.  The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arrive after the date of this call.  A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","As you can see in the release our results this quarter include a number of nonrecurring items under non-GAAP adjustments.  In an effort to provide clarity from the distortion of some of these items our comments on this call will focus on results including certain adjustments which are noted in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release.  You\u2019ll note that our earnings guidance is also presented on an adjusted basis.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Bret Wise.  Bret?","Bret Wise","Yeah, thank you Derek.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us on the call this morning.  DENTSPLY had another very strong quarter in Q2 which built on the solid start we had in Q1 this year.  We had record performance in both sales and adjusted earnings.  Our total growth ex-PM came in at 23.8% and that included internal growth of 3.6%.  Earnings were very strong at $0.62 adjusted EPS and that was driven by numerous factors which we\u2019ll get into in a moment; however, the most important in my mind is the operating expansion that we saw in our base business.","These results exceeded our own expectations for the quarter by a couple cents per share and overall we view it as a very strong performance operationally.  In a moment we\u2019ll give more details on the performance but before we do I have a few comments on the overall dental market.  I think it\u2019s fair to say that the global dental market probably slowed at least modestly in the quarter, most noticeably in the US.  Job growth in the US as you know remains weak and we\u2019ve seen economic projections for the back half of the year come down really meaningfully at this point.  Although dental is not as dependent on economic factors as other markets we\u2019re not immune either.  At present, the weak job market is clearly bearing on consumer confidence and has had a modest effect in our view on the dental consumption thus far.  So although markets continue to grow it\u2019s more modest than it was say six months ago.","In Europe we believe that the market is still in positive territory in total although market dynamics vary significantly from geographic markets to country markets.  As you know, the economic headlines have not really improved and may have eroded a bit.  From a currency perspective it\u2019s also no secret that the Euro has declined significantly from a year ago.  At current rates the decline of the Euro will be at the 13% plus range in Q3 versus the prior year quarter, which improves our cost position for products produced in the Eurozone but also reduces profits when profits are translated back to dollars.  Both those are important dynamics for us.","In the rest of the world category which includes some 120 country markets for us we continue to see signs of strength which is reflected in our rest of world growth this quarter.  This includes both the developed and the developing portions of that rest of world category for us.  With this backdrop we\u2019re very pleased to report what we view as very strong results for the company.  Let me give you firs the highlights to start and then Chris is going to comment on the Astra Tech integration and our ortho re-launch program, and then finally Bill will provide some details on our financial performance.","As noted in the release sales as reported were $763 million; that\u2019s up 25.2%, and excluding precious metals content sales were up 23.8%.  Both the sales with and without metal were records for Q2 and it\u2019s driven primarily by our 2011 acquisitions, most notably Astra Tech; but also reflects a solid internal growth building off a very solid start we had in Q1.  At a high level our internal growth continues to be driven by new products, continued above-market performance in the dental specialties and some continued improvement in our lab business.","Our growth excluding precious metals for the quarter breaks down as follows: as I mentioned total growth was 23.8% and that was comprised of internal growth of 3.6% and acquisition growth of 26.4% to result in constant currency growth of 30.0%.  Currency translation was a (-)2.6% this quarter.  Internal growth at 3.6% was again negatively impacted but really only slightly by the supply outage in orthodontics.  Excluding Japan and orthodontics internal growth was 3.9% for the quarter.  This is a good result against a sluggish GDP growth really in most of the developed regions around the world and for the first half in total we\u2019re pleased with our internal growth performance again ex-ortho and \u2013Japan at the 4.2% in this economic environment.  ","Geographic internal growth was positive in each of our major regions and I\u2019ll give this to you first in total and then without orthodontics and Japan.  So first in total, external growth was 1.0% in the US; again despite the orthodontics headwind.  It was positive 2.8% for Europe and a positive 8.6% for the rest of the world.  Without ortho and Japan internal growth ex-PM was 2.9% in the US so you can see that orthodontics had the largest effect on internal growth in the US this quarter.  Internal growth in Europe ex-ortho was 2.6% - a good result in light of the macro headlines we see in the region; and rest of the world ex-ortho and \u2013Japan was 8.1% which is encouraging results and reflect the initiatives we have for the emerging markets that we\u2019ve discussed with you on recent calls.","To elaborate further on geographic growth ex-ortho and \u2013Japan, our sales growth in the US slowed in most categories from the very fast pace we\u2019d experienced in Q4 last year and Q1 this year.  In particular we saw slower growth in consumption of the chair-side consumables, most notably in the small equipment category.  Ex-small equipment this category grew mid-single digits.  Although this is still positive performance compared to what we believe the market is growing it does indicate to us that there\u2019s been a slight slowing in dental demand during this most recent quarter.","Beyond the consumables category we had solid mid-single growth in the specialties, again ex-ortho and in lab.  One last point in the US, it\u2019s the only region where orthodontics again impacted us negatively as we prioritized regions outside the US in our early re-launch program.  Chris is going to provide more details on that.  ","Likewise in Europe our internal growth was 2.6% and we believe that\u2019s well above the market; and again, it\u2019s driven by our innovation, our new products introduced both last year and this year.  Growth was mid-single digits in both consumables and specialties, again ex-orthodontics.  In lab it was down low-single digits driven by the alloys, and excluding alloy volumes lab grew again this quarter.  While we\u2019re pleased with this performance relative to the market I think it\u2019s fair to say we remain cautious on this region given the economic uncertainties that they face.","Our performance in the rest of the world segments, back in the range we\u2019ve grown historically at 8.1% and some of our recent investments in this area I think are paying off.  We had double-digit growth in several key categories including Asia and Middle East\/Africa.  On product categories our global internal growth was mid-single digits in the specialties despite the slight drag from orthodontics; mid-single digits in consumables and slightly negative in lab.  Again, without alloys the lab business showed low-single digit growth.","In implants our pro forma internal growth was positive in the low-single digits range reflecting some slowing of this market.  With approximately half the market now reporting we believe that we\u2019ll probably continue to grow at a premium to market this quarter despite the distractions that we have from the integration process.","On earnings Bill will have more detail, however we\u2019re pleased to see continued expansion in gross margins.  This is due in large part to mix but also to pricing and manufacturing efficiencies.  I will point out that we had some growth in inventories in this period that\u2019s aiding the performance here and we expect the inventory levels will come down in the back half of the year.  The expense ratios improved significantly on a sequential basis. The combination of both the gross margins and the improvement in the expense ratio of course drove the operating margins up 170 basis points sequentially and it\u2019s now approaching the operating margins that we had before the Astra Tech acquisition.  We do expect some pressure on rates in the back half of the year as we reduce inventories.  I think we have a lot more work to do here but it\u2019s encouraging to see that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.","As expected we commenced the rolling re-launch of our orthodontic brackets late in the quarter.  The re-launch varies by product and by region but it\u2019s well underway at this point.  As noted, sales of orthodontic products outside the US were accretive to our growth rate as we restocked customers.  Earnings for orthodontics were neutral year-over-year in the quarter which is $0.10 per share or so better than we expected coming into the quarter.  In Q3 we expect US growth to be aided by more emphasis on the re-launch now in this region versus the rest of the world category and we expect to see the same impact in the US from the restocking effect beginning in Q3.","As far as earnings phasing, the re-launch of the international markets probably pulled $0.01 or so per share into Q2 from Q3.  We\u2019ll discuss this more when we discuss the earnings guidance for the back half.  Our earnings non-GAAP came in at $0.62 per share.  That\u2019s up 10.7% from the prior year quarter and I think it\u2019s important to note that the prior-year quarter we also grew 10%, so we\u2019ve got back-to-back double-digit earnings growth here for Q2.  ","We view this as a very strong performance and it was a few cents\u2019 per share better than we anticipated coming into the quarter, in part due to the orthodontics improvement and in part due to the really significant improvement of the operational performance of the business, particularly in operating margins.  And those factors helped us overcome an increasing drag from currency in Q2.","Looking forward the Euro is of particular concern to us.  It was down 11% on average in Q2 and at current rates it\u2019ll be down a bit more than that in the back half with the greatest impact in Q3.  This creates a meaningful sales and earnings headwind for the balance of the year at this point, so despite strong operational performance we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.24 for the full year and that\u2019s versus our earlier guidance of $2.22 to $2.30.  Even with the weak Euro we anticipate double-digit earnings growth for the last six months in total which is likely to be higher in Q4 than in Q3.","That concludes my comments.  I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Chris who\u2019s going to comment further on the Astra Tech integration and the orthodontics re-launch status.  Chris?","Chris Clark","Thank you, Bret, and good morning, everyone.  I\u2019m going to take a few moments and provide some deeper insights into the recovery of our orthodontics business as well as a brief update on the Astra Tech integration efforts.","As Bret mentioned we initiated a rolling re-launch of our orthodontics products in Q2 and actually were able to move a bit faster in some respects than we previously expected.  We raised and now have eliminated allocations or limits on most product lines, allowing customers to order in desired quantities.  We also have been able to reestablish supply to many of our international distributors including providing them product to replenish their previously depleted inventories.  ","We\u2019re moving forward with our efforts to gain back customers that we lost during the supply outage and our pace of customer recovery is in line with what we expected.  We are pleased with the number of customers that have come back to us quickly now that we have consistent supply but we also recognize that a number of customers will be harder to regain given their experience with competitive offerings over the last year.   ","We anticipate that our competition will do their best to not make it easy for us to regain these customers, and as such we anticipate an aggressive fight at the street level over the next several quarters to gather back our customer base.  We continue to believe that this will be a multiyear competitive effort to recapture our lost market share but we are pleased with our initial progress thus far.  We\u2019ve also secured a revised supply agreement with our manufacturing partner that provides for continued access to the current portfolio but also provides greater latitude relative to manufacturing, sourcing and commercial approaches for both parties.","In addition we\u2019ve significantly expanded our R&D resources in the orthodontics area which we think will pay long-term strategic dividends for us moving forward.  In short, we remain extremely committed to the orthodontics space and to rebuilding a stronger, healthier orthodontics business for DENTSPLY.  And looking forward, as Bret mentioned, we anticipate orthodontics to be increasingly accretive over the next two quarters to both sales and earnings growth.","I\u2019d now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts.  As Bret mentioned, our country-specific integration efforts continue to be on track and we\u2019re pleased with the overall progress of the integration.  We\u2019ve completed the launch of our combined DENTSPLY implants organization in North America and most recently in Iberia and are moving forward with other countries between now and early 2013.  ","Our sales training efforts are continuing and while there is always some level of disruption during these types of field integrations we\u2019re pleased with the tenure of the organization and feedback remains positive regarding the strength of our combined portfolio of implant solutions.  One key positive synergy is the expanded focus on the Atlantis customized deposit platform and we\u2019re very pleased with the trajectory of this business.  We\u2019re making capacity investments in Atlantis to support the additional sales momentum associated with the acquisition, and we continue to believe that the combined digital solution platform that includes Atlantis customized abutments, Isis customized bars and bridges, and materialized treatment planning software and surgical guides is a very powerful synergy for the combined implant business.  We\u2019re very confident that each of these product platforms will benefit from the additional support of the combined business.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail.  Bill?","Bill Jellison","Thanks, Chris.  Good morning, everyone.  Just a couple of additional comments regarding our sales: the Q2 2012 geographic mix of sales without precious metal content was as follows.  The US represented 33% of sales, Europe was 45% this year and the rest of the world was 22% of sales.  The strengthening of the dollar compared to Q2 of last year negatively impacted our top line growth ex-precious metals by 6.2% in the quarter.  ","The FX impact on earnings was less as we had also benefited from favorable transaction and net investment hedges in the period which helped offset a portion of the negative variance in the quarter.  We currently expect about a 6% headwind from current foreign exchange rates on the top line and slightly less of an impact on the bottom line this year, with the largest negative impact occurring in Q3.","As Derek mentioned, and as you can see in our earnings release, Q2 included a number of items which impacted our results.  By excluding these items from our quarterly results we believe the adjusted figures provide a more comparable picture of the company\u2019s performance.  Most of the following comments exclude the impact from these items.  ","Gross margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in Q2 2012 were 59.0% compared to 56.1% for Q2 2011.  When compared to the same period last year, this rate was positively impacted by favorable product mix and price increase.  Our product mix continues to be benefited by the strong gross margin rates of our recent acquisitions and by strong sales of endodontic products.","FX, despite having a negative impact on sales and EPS in total had a slight favorable impact on gross margin rates.  The quarter also benefited from some additional positive manufacturing variances as inventories ended higher, therefore capturing some costs in the inventory.  The inventory is expected to be reduced through the balance of the year which should improve cash flow but which will reduce manufacturing costs absorption.","Our recent acquisitions are expected to still have a positive  mix impact on gross profit margin rates comparisons in Q3 but to a lesser extent as they are fully reflected in the company\u2019s results.  SG&A on an adjusted basis was $282.2 million or 40.4% of sales ex-precious metals in Q2 2012 versus 37.2% in the prior year\u2019s Q2, and down from 42.6% in Q1.  ","On a year-over-year basis our SG&A rates are running higher for two reasons.  First, our recent acquisitions have higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales than our base business.  This will be mitigated somewhat as we complete our integration efforts over the next few years.  Second, orthodontics sales are still down slightly, however we have maintained the infrastructure of this business and are now also in the process of a full re-launch of these products.  This year-over-year comparison with a higher expense level as a percentage of sales will continue through Q3 when the acquisition impacts annualize and the orthodontics business begins to show year-over-year improvements.","Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 18.6% in Q2 compared to 18.9% last year in the same period.  As Bret noted, ortho and Japan and a neutral impact on EPS in Q2 and will have a positive impact on results in the second half of 2012 compared to last year.  Net interest and other expense in Q2 on a reported basis was $13.3 million compared to $4.6 million last year in Q2.  This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech.","Our reported tax rate for Q2 was 15.6%, however there are tax adjustments reflected in the rate.  On an adjusted basis, our operating tax rate for this quarter was approximately 23.0% compared to an adjusted tax rate of 20.1% in Q2 of last year.  The tax rate was being adjusted in Q2 last year as we benefited from a decision to permanently reinvest more of our international income.  We believe that a tax rate of approximately 23% is reasonable as well for all of 2012.","To better understand and follow some of the following comments you can look at the tables included in our recent press release which reconcile performance from US generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP performance.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in Q2 2012 on an as-reported basis was $80.8 million or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to $74.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share in Q2 2011.  As mentioned previously, these results include a number of items mostly associated with acquisitions and tax adjustments which are detailed in the press release issued this morning.","On an adjusted basis, earnings excluding restructuring, acquisition-related costs and other related items, and tax adjustments in both periods which constitute a non-GAAP measure were $88.5 million or $0.62 per diluted share in Q2 2012, compared to $80 million or $0.56 per diluted share in Q2 2011 \u2013 a 10.7% increase.  The quarter benefited from solid internal growth and a substantial improvement in operating margins within our base business.  This quarter does include a couple positive benefits.  It includes a benefit from the re-launch of orthodontic products which included some reloading of international ortho dealers previously expected to occur in Q3.  The quarter also benefited from producing some additional inventory in a couple of areas that we expect will be reduced to a more normal level by year end.","Cash flow from operating activities in the first half of 2012 was approximately $100 million compared to $167 million in the first half of last year.  Inventories increased to support the rebuilding of inventory for our orthodontic re-launch, to support inventory levels during our integration activities, and to support a couple of other key product lines.  Cash flow was also negatively impacted by the timing of some tax payments that fell into the first half of this year.  We expect cash flow to accelerate significantly in the back half of the year, however.","Capital expenditures were $43 million in the first half of the year with depreciation and amortization of approximately $68 million in that same period.  We do expect capital spending will continue to run higher compared to recent years as we are spending to support business and new product growth, including the additional capital to support growth and new product launches within the recent year.","Inventory days were 111 as of the end of Q2 2012 compared to 104 days at the end of Q2 last year.  These levels also reflect the addition of the Astra Tech inventory, the build of the orthodontic inventory to support the re-launch of the product line, and to support a couple of the other key product lines.  ","Accounts receivable days were 55 days at the end of Q2 2012 compared to 59 days at the end of Q2 last year.  At the end of Q2 2012 we had $53 million in cash and short-term investments, total debt was $1.7 billion at the end of Q2.  In 2012, we have repurchased approximately $39 million of our stock or approximately 1 million shares at an average price of $39.  Based on the company\u2019s authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of Treasury stock we still have approximately 13 million shares available for repurchase; however, our primary focus will be on reducing our current debt at this time rather than share repurchase other than potential repurchases to offset options.","As mentioned before, recent acquisitions have increased the volatility that changes in FX rates have on our sales and earnings as more of our sales and production is now located outside of the US.  We are most impacted on sales by changes in the Euro and our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the Euro, Swiss Franc, Swedish Krona and also the Japanese Yen.  ","We are utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business.  At current exchange rates we expect to have a negative impact on foreign exchange rates for the remainder of 2012 of five percentage points to seven percentage points on sales.  The impact on EPS will be slightly less given our hedging techniques with the greatest impact expected in Q3 this year.","Finally, as Bret mentioned, we are reducing our 2012 earnings per share guidance to $2.18 to $2.24 per share on an adjusted basis.  This reduction is being made primarily to reflect the weakness of the Euro and other European currencies offset somewhat by slightly improved operating performance.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  Thanks for your support and we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions.)  We\u2019ll take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the question.  So it certainly does seem like things decelerated a bit \u2013 I know you guys talked about the [endo] consumables, implants, certain regions and categories.  I was just wondering specifically relative to the changes in guidance it sounds like a lot of that reduction is coming from FX but I was wondering if there was any portion of the reduced outlook that is from what we\u2019re seeing across some weakening demand out there.","Bret Wise","Good morning, Bob, good question.  I think there\u2019s a number of factors that affect our change in our guidance for this year.  Certainly the US has slowed a little bit from where the market was in Q4 and Q1.  I would call that slowing modest at this point and we\u2019ll need to see the distributor\u2019s report to really confirm how modest it was or if it declined at all.  We only have of course access to our own numbers and who else has reported thus far but it does seem like it weakened a little bit.","I would say when you take all the factors into account most of the factors come out in the wash, meaning there\u2019s lots of positive operational performance, there\u2019s expanding margins, there\u2019s good progress on the Astra Tech integration, there\u2019s the ortho re-launch, there\u2019s some slowing of markets.  But if you put those all together they\u2019re kind of coming out in the wash.  The reduction in guidance is coming directly from the decline in the Euro and the impact that has on us because a large portion of our business is in Europe.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful.  And then just hoping we can dig in a little bit more into the strong performance in rest of the world.  I know you have shared some of the initiatives there in previous calls but I was just wondering if maybe you could share specific categories, products or countries that really helped drive that growth in the rest of the world.","Bret Wise","Well, what I\u2019ll say at the outset here, and then Chris might want to elaborate on this some more; but what I\u2019ll say at the outset is we saw very strong growth in Asia \u2013 we\u2019ve made some important investments there \u2013 and also Middle East\/Africa.  So those regions in particular we saw very high growth.  Of course this rest of the world category is made up of both developed and developing markets so there\u2019s a balance there but we thought 8.1% growth across all that balance of regions was pretty strong performance and was getting us back to the range we\u2019ve kind of seen before.  And Chris, do you want to\u2026","Chris Clark","Yeah, I would just comment, Bob, that the initiatives we spoke to I think on the last call in terms of dual branding, certainly the sales presence and some investments there, the clinical education \u2013 that seems to be really driving I think the improvement if you will in the rest of the world business, back to frankly where we\u2019ve been but for the prior two quarters.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much, Chris.  If I could actually, you did mention greater latitude and increased R&D in ortho \u2013 if I could just sneak this one in.  I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on that, the [intention] to move away from the current supplier and then maybe just any order of magnitude around the investments needed there.  That would be really helpful.  Thanks so much, guys.","Chris Clark","No worries.  I mean obviously no, we have a long-term partnership with our supplier and obviously that\u2019s been a very good partnership and we have every expectation that it will continue to be.  But obviously as we looked at it we believed that something that provides a little greater latitude I think for both parties particularly in light of the fact that we have the opportunity really at our end to reduce kind of our dependence on a single source of supply which I think is pretty important given what we\u2019ve gone through in the last year.  So again, I think that they\u2019re an important supplier for us.  They\u2019ll continue to be and again, we look forward to moving forward with them albeit with a little bit more latitude for both of us.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks everyone.  Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.  Bret, I wanted to revisit your comments on the slowing of the US market that you highlighted early on, particularly on economic exposure.  It seemed like we were in maybe the third quarter of a volume rebound in the US after really a few years where volumes have been a little underwhelming; and what we saw was that rebound was a bit off-cycle in terms of where patient flow was relative to broader macro.  So I wonder what is it you think is different now about the macro outlook?  Is it Europe, is it something about the US that\u2019s bringing us back onto cycle in terms of the macro exposure?","Bret Wise","It\u2019s a good question and a hard one to answer, to be honest.  Trying to take into account what\u2019s influencing a patient into doing a procedure or not doing a procedure, particularly a discretionary procedure or a premium procedure \u2013 it\u2019s always difficult to nail that down to one or two things.  I think what we hear talking to both other people in the market as well as customers and so forth is there\u2019 s a little bit more resistance to doing discretionary procedures that can be deferred compared to what we were seeing six months ago; and I think it\u2019s basically driven by people\u2019s perception of where the economy is headed more so than where the economy might be right now.  But that\u2019s just speculation on our part really.  There\u2019s no real way to confirm that\u2019s the case.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, I really appreciate that and I wanted to throw in one follow-up on the European markets.  I wonder if you could go into more detail on some of the core countries there, specifically what you\u2019re seeing in Germany, France and the Benelux countries.  Clearly there\u2019s no major falloff there but relative to Q1 can you give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand and patient volume trends in those particular countries?  Thanks, and I\u2019ll drop off.","Bret Wise","Sure.  I think rather than go through country-by-country I\u2019d just rather characterize it by region.  Whereas in the South we continue to see very weak conditions \u2013 in fact those markets, I believe, are still contracting; whereas in the North those markets are stable to growing slightly.  So in total because the markets in the North reflect more of the aggregate market I think on balance in Europe in total \u2013 including CIS \u2013 the northern countries are able to offset the decline in the southern countries.  And I\u2019m not going to get more specific than that other than regionally we still see the split that we saw really for the last two years.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks, good morning everyone.  So my main question, Bret, I think you already answered so I won\u2019t belabor it.  I guess to reiterate what the previous questioner had asked was it seems like traditionally you\u2019ve always said that your lagging indicator of trends in the US market, it took you longer to sort of see the downturn and longer to see the upturn; and you felt good that you were starting to see that.  It seems like what you\u2019re saying today is you\u2019re not seeing a dramatic change \u2013 it\u2019s just sort of a heads up.  The leading indicator is what you\u2019re saying is a little bit of difference in purchasing behavior, so it doesn\u2019t sound like your view of internal growth US back half has changed a lot \u2013 or am I putting words in your mouth?","Bret Wise","No, Larry, that\u2019s a good way to describe it.  I think when we look at the US market because it\u2019s mostly driven by employment \u2013 dental insurance is mostly driven by employment.  That seems to have moderated somewhat.  We\u2019re not seeing the job growth that we saw let\u2019s say December through February which means we\u2019re getting less people coming in to being covered again.  And so sequentially I\u2019d say there\u2019s just a modest slowing of the market.  I don\u2019t want to overstate it because the market\u2019s still stable; it\u2019s still a growing market.  I think there\u2019s still good patient flow but I think just at the margins, particularly in the discretionary procedures it may have slowed down a bit.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay.  So it sounds like a slight moderation in your expectation of internal growth US but not much.","Bret Wise","I think that\u2019s fair.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay.  My second question really is on the quarter and on the puts and takes just to triangulate some of the things you guys are saying.  I think Bret, you had said the quarter itself you felt like was $0.05 or $0.06, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, versus consensus maybe above your own internal expectations.  A penny or two came from the orthodontic re-launch.  You had mentioned some benefit from operational initiatives and then later I think, Bill, you talked about some benefit from inventory.  So if we think about say a $0.06 upside versus [AR] number, maybe a penny or two from orthodontic, a couple of cents from operational and maybe a penny or two from inventory timing?  Is that the right way to think of it?","","Bret Wise","No, I think it\u2019s difficult to do that.  I mean we\u2019re giving you our view of how we did versus our own expectations for the quarter, and of course our quarterly phasing may be different than the street\u2019s.  Q2 is almost always the strongest quarter for us.  If you just look at it historically when were the peaks in earnings it\u2019s usually high in Q2 and then it\u2019s low in Q3 because Europe basically disappears for six weeks in the summer \u2013 July and August.  And we\u2019re expecting that to happen again, by the way. ","But versus our own expectations we came in a couple cents above it.  I\u2019d say about a penny of it was due to ortho being a little earlier than we thought and maybe a penny or two pennies is just due to stronger operational performance, very strong operating margins.  And Bill did comment we\u2019ve built out inventory this quarter and that will be coming out in the back half of the year, so we probably had a little better absorption across our different operating facilities.  But I think it\u2019s hard to bridge that to the $0.06 beat versus the street consensus primarily because our phasing has always been different than the street\u2019s was on this year.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, so currency really didn\u2019t hurt you in Q2 relative to sort of what you thought back in May?","Bret Wise","No, and I\u2019ll comment on this and I\u2019ll have Bill comment on it as well.  Currency did hurt us this quarter, however the operating margin improvement in the base business \u2013 meaning not Astra Tech, not ortho \u2013 the base business was enough to overcome that this quarter.  Bill, do you have any comments on currency?","Bill Jellison","Yeah.  So we expected currency was going to be a little bit of a drag already in Q2; it obviously got worse in the back half of that quarter.  So we still ended up maybe a couple cents negative from FX in there but I think as Bret mentioned a couple of the operational-related improvements including a little bit of the inventory build as well as that ortho pull that ultimately was able to be shipped already in Q2 versus in Q3 also benefited us a couple cents.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great.  And then just to triangulate as best I can on the full year, the midpoint of your guidance is down $0.05 \u2013 obviously a big headwind in currency, Q3 down 13% year-over-year so that\u2019s going to be a big drag; Q4 maybe not as much.  So it sounds like in our numbers currency was a little bigger impact second half, a couple more cents than that.  Is that the right way to think about it and is some of that being offset by some of this operational benefit versus your earlier guidance?","Bill Jellison","There\u2019s more currency here than we\u2019ve reduced the guidance for, meaning our operational performance, the improvement in margins and accretion from Astra Tech and the ortho re-launch is offsetting some of the currency decline that we would have otherwise had.  In addition to that we have hedging programs in place that help moderate some of the currency effects as well.  So less of the currency is going to drop through this year than the full effect on sales. ","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Right, so the good news is some of the benefits from operations are offsetting some of the obvious drag on currency is what you\u2019re saying.","Bill Jellison","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, and then finally I just want to make sure I heard Chris correctly on the Astra Tech integration.  We\u2019ve had some real mixed signals so far as you\u2019ve said this quarter on implants.  It sounds like you\u2019re saying you\u2019re growing at a slight premium to the market; last quarter your growth was slightly down.  Is the message here that the volume trends there in the quarter were again not substantially different than they were in Q2; and is the message on integration and product line rollout still on track and consistent with what you had said previously?","Chris Clark","Yeah, Larry, I would say that I think the implant market volume-wise is probably a bit directionally softer in Q2 than in Q1.  At this point we\u2019ve now got three announcements from three of the five public players and I think that\u2019s pretty indicative of at least those three.  I mean obviously we\u2019ll listen to the last two here as they announce shortly.  In terms of the integration, I mean I do basically think our results continue to be as Bret mentioned above what we estimate market growth to be; obviously that\u2019ll be confirmed here shortly.  ","And I think that\u2019s a really good sign in light of the integration.  I mean anytime you go through an integration certainly of this magnitude there\u2019s a lot of distraction, a lot of disruption and I would say we went in expecting there to be some of that and I think that team is doing a very good job of managing the business through that.  And I think overall, while there are some bumps we\u2019re overall very pleased with the progress and certainly very pleased with the attitude, the mood and really kind of the energy from the organization which I think is really the main thing that we want to keep an eye on.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, very good.  Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi, good morning.  Bill, any chance you can give us a sense of how you see the core revenue trends by geography developing in the second half?  What have you embedded in your formal outlook for the ortho Japan rebound given the faster than expected recovery?  Should we expect something a little bit better than flattish in terms of the revenue impact year-over-year?","Bill Jellison","Well, I think there are two points there.  First off we really don\u2019t give any projections on our expected geographic growth moving forward but I think that with what you\u2019ve seen here we\u2019re seeing improvements in some areas but obviously the economic changes that are affecting the broader economy are still a big question.  But we\u2019re still looking at the back half of the year pretty consistent with kind of what we were looking at in the first half broadly. ","From an ortho perspective, we pulled forward a little bit of the initial international dealer rebuilding of inventories in Q2 but from an overall perspective in ortho at this point we still would expect that we would definitely see year-over-year sales improvements in both Q3 and Q4; and we would also see earnings improvements in ortho in both Q3 and Q4 of this year.  And for the full year I think that we still have an expectation that we should be at least neutral if not slightly positive from an overall year-over-year comparison on earnings for ortho.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then the revised EPS outlook appears to contemplate a little stiffer FX headwind than I would have anticipated.  Are you assuming that the Euro deteriorates further from here? And then can you give us a sense of why the relatively wide range for the currency impact on revenue for the year?","Bill Jellison","Well, I don\u2019t think the currency range that we gave is all that big for currency in general.  But we stated in the guidance that that is really reflecting kind of a 121 to 123 range on the Euro for the back half of the year, which is in essence consistent with where it\u2019s currently been running the last few days.  From an overall perspective for the year we\u2019re expecting that currency is going to probably be in the 5%, maybe 6% impact on the top line.  ","As Bret mentioned and as it was mentioned on the call, as far as the Euro is concerned \u2013 the Euro itself is probably closer to 12% to 14% worse when you look at it compared to Q3 last year.  Keep in mind that\u2019s only one currency for us and also keep in mind that that\u2019s the full move of it and we\u2019re only 60%, 65% international.  So you\u2019ve got to bring that down to that level.  But instead of 6.2% negative currency impact that we had on the top line in Q2 we\u2019d expect something probably a little bit higher than that in Q3 and probably a little bit lower than that in Q4 at current rates.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks.  And then lastly, with respect to the med device tax should we expect that you\u2019d take the incremental pricing in September in line with your typical annual pricing?  Have you finalized your plans there yet?","Bill Jellison","Sure.  I mean at this point in time we generally do a lot of our price increase already beginning at the end of Q4 but this tax doesn\u2019t go into effect until January.  So at this stage the way that we\u2019re planning on addressing it is probably in a two-tiered pricing increase level.  We\u2019ll have normal price increases that take place but then for any locations or products that are impacted by the med tech tax here in the US we\u2019ll be doing an additional price increase effective as of the beginning of next year.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Thanks very much.  You guys mentioned inventory build a few times on the call.  Can you just expand a bit on that?  Was that all driven by the re-launch of ortho internationally or was there more to it than that?","Bret Wise","I\u2019ll take a stab at that, John, and see if anyone else has something to add but there\u2019s a couple factors there.  One is the ortho re-launch as you\u2019ve noted, we\u2019ve built up inventory so we can do full customer service and we would expect that to probably trend down over the back half of the year.  We\u2019re also in the mist of the Astra Tech integration so we\u2019re consolidating inventory points at different locations in the world and thus we ramped up inventory a little bit because we need to stock the new location before we deplete the old location \u2013 so that\u2019s having an effect.  ","And then there\u2019s some other kind of one-off issues in other businesses that we are raising inventories temporarily in which will come back out in either the back half of the year or the first half of next year.  But we do view this level of inventory as a little bit above the normal range we would expect to have to carry for he business and we expect to get that cash flow back over the next let\u2019s say six to nine months.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Great.  And just to clarify your comments on inventory reflect your inventory that you\u2019re carrying as opposed to inventory in the channel \u2013 is that right?","Bret Wise","Yes, it\u2019s inventory on our balance sheet, right.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Great, thanks.  Jut stepping back thinking about your adjusted geographic [growth steps] that you gave, it seems like the US had a notable slowing versus what you said in Q1 but rest of the world is noticeably better.  If you look at those two big changes, in your view were they driven more by your specialty businesses or by your preventive and restorative lines?","Bret Wise","Okay, just a couple comments here. One is the pace we had in Q4 and Q1, we were in the mid-7\u2019s both quarters \u2013 it was a blistering pace.  We were probably growing at least 2x market at that point and that was driven by what we\u2019ve been talking about for 18 months which is the new products that we launched in 2011 and to a lesser degree here in 2012.  We had said at the time that that\u2019s not sustainable, that\u2019s going to have to come down although we think we can continue to grow above market which I think we\u2019re doing right now despite having to overcome those product launches now that are in the baseline.","We do believe on top of that that the market probably did slow or moderate a little bit.  I think it\u2019s still growing nicely but maybe not at the pace we had for Q4 last year and Q1 this year which is kind of consistent with the comments we made earlier on the question.  And then lastly affecting in particular our Q1 growth was we did see lower small equipment sales in the US, in part due to product launches last year where we\u2019re coming up against the base now and in part because we think that may be the element of the market that\u2019s slowing or has slowed or moderate the most.  Certainly that part of our business is deferrable.  A dentist doesn\u2019t have to buy that equipment; they can make do with their own equipment a while longer if they need to.","So in our mind that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.  We think we\u2019re still probably growing 1.5x market, something like that, not quite the pace we were before but still good growth compared to the overall market.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Great, thanks.  And one last question: if you think about the various puts and takes of your ortho business, do you think longer term that can be as profitable as it was before for you, more or less?  I\u2019m thinking on the one hand I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s going to have to be some more aggressive pricing strategies to retake share but on the other hand it sounds like you\u2019ve got a new, more flexible manufacturing agreement.","Bret Wise","Well, I think there are a few important dynamics there.  We\u2019re entering, basically reentering the market which is a competitive market already and we\u2019re going to be taking market share from our competitors who aren\u2019t going to want to give it up.  And we fully believe that people will be aggressive in the marketplace and we\u2019re going to have to respond.  Longer term we\u2019ve historically only had a distribution margin in this business.  Longer term through our own innovation and other arrangements we expect we\u2019ll be able to pick up a little bit more margin, so longer term I would think this would be a more profitable business than it has been in the past.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thank you, good morning guys.  Bret, I was wondering, not to harp on this but if we can focus on second half guidance here again.  With FX maybe incrementally a $0.05 hit or so and you\u2019re trimming guidance by $0.05 \u2013 it all seems to make sense.  What I can\u2019t get straight in my mind is the gating of guidance with this quarter\u2019s upside versus the second half now, where that\u2019s being guided.  As I think about things you guys did $0.97 in the second half last year; you\u2019re guiding to about a midpoint of $1.07 this year in the second half that has maybe $0.05, $0.06 of year-over-year currency headwind.  But you\u2019re also picking up about $0.10 or so from ortho coming back; you should have some accretion in there from Astra Tech yet that core guidance looks like it\u2019s only about $0.05 or 5% once you adjust for those factors.  So what am I missing there in the second half guidance?","Bret Wise","Well, a couple things I\u2019d keep in mind here and Bill, you might have some additional comments on this.  But keep in mind that our phasing of the quarters was not what the street\u2019s phasing was.  Q2 is almost always our strongest quarter so we had more income in our base model in Q2 and less in Q3 than the street had and I think that\u2019s confusing this issue a bit.  ","The other thing to keep in mind is that Astra Tech is hitting our targets, it\u2019s doing very well but we had Astra Tech in the baseline for four months last year; and in the back half the months that we didn\u2019t have are July and August which aren\u2019t typically robust months for sales in Europe.  So Astra Tech is proceeding fine, it\u2019s going to be accretive, it\u2019s hitting our targets, etc., etc. but it\u2019s in the baseline now for the last four months of the year.","The ortho recovery is as you said \u2013 we did pull a little bit of it into Q2 but we\u2019re going to have more earnings growth from orthodontics in the back half of the year.  And the currency hit that you described is actually greater than you\u2019ve said; it\u2019s just that we\u2019re going to be able to mitigate part of that currency hit through the hedges and through better operational performance.  Bill, did I miss any key points?","Bill Jellison","Just one point of clarification, Jeff.  What did you actually think or say about ortho in the back half?","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Well, if you\u2019re saying it should be flat to accretive for the year and you\u2019ve lost about $0.03 or so this year so far year-to-date on it \u2013 or you\u2019re about flat or down a penny or two year-to-date, so I guess flat or up a penny in the second half.  But last year it was what, I think a $0.10 drag in Q3 and Q4 combined?  So a $0.10 drag last year versus flat this year seems like that should be adding quite a bit.","Bill Jellison","No, no, no.  What you\u2019ve got to think of is the improvement we\u2019re talking about is off of last year, right?  So if we were down roughly $0.04 to $0.05 in ortho each quarter last year we\u2019ll be improving off of that level to offset kind of the slight negative that we had in the first half of this year.  But we aren\u2019t offsetting that and being flat.  We aren\u2019t making all that back up in the second half of the year.  So think of it that we should be improving by a few cents per quarter in ortho but we\u2019re still going to be down in comparison to where we were in 2010 in the back half of the year.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","That\u2019s helpful and maybe we can follow up on currency offline, Bill.  And the two last questions for me: any updates on either lithium disilicate product for launch anytime in the upcoming quarters and the mill-able cobalt chrome material?","Chris Clark ","Yes, I\u2019ll just comment loosely on the lab side, Jeff, in terms of new products.  Those are two obviously pretty attractive areas in the lab business.  They\u2019re areas obviously that we\u2019re interested in.  We\u2019ve got a pretty aggressive new product portfolio on the lab side that we would look forward to showing at some point here in the next few quarters.  But I\u2019m not going to comment on those two more specifically or specific timing.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Alright, thanks Chris.  And the last question then: Bret, you had mentioned that your inventory levels went up on your balance sheet \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a distributor comment.  I think the last couple quarters though you felt like distributors were maybe carrying a bit less inventory than they had historically.   Did that change at all this quarter or do you still feel like they\u2019re a little under the historical range, or any insight there?","Bret Wise","Yeah, I think certainly we didn\u2019t build inventory in the channel this quarter.  We might have depleted a little bit of inventory in the channel but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any dramatic change.  Chris is a little bit closer.","Chris Clark","Yeah, I would say, Jeff, I absolutely agree with that.  I don\u2019t think we built in aggregate by any stretch.  I do think that some of these distributors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in terms of how to operate with a bit less so you know, I don\u2019t know that I would say there\u2019s necessarily pent-up demand if you will for additional inventories at a dealer level.  I think they\u2019ve come down a little bit and they\u2019re going to remain generally at that level, and I think our shipments are in aggregate pretty reflective of what we assume aggregate consumption to be.  Obviously there\u2019s puts and takes in any individual business but I think in aggregate it\u2019s pretty consistent.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Fair enough, thanks guys.","Bret Wise","And I would add to that, Jeff, that that comment excludes the orthodontics business because certainly we added inventory to the channel in orthodontics outside the US.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Fair enough, got it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take the next question from [Eden Ling] with Deutsche Bank.","[Eden Ling] \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I\u2019ve got a few questions on the dental implant business.  Would it be fair to say from your comments that globally the dental implant business slowed by about 2%, 3% versus last quarter?  And if so, if you could give us some sense of how that developed in the key regions and to what extent those numbers are being impacted by the disruptions in the Astra Tech integration.  And then hopefully if you have a crystal ball what would your expectations be for this business for the rest of the year?  We did see comps ease in the back half of last year particularly in Europe so any comments there would be great.  Thank you.","Bret Wise","Okay, this is Bret.  I\u2019ll take a stab at a few of these and if Chris or Bill want to add in they can.  Your first question was whether our implant business slowed by two to three percentage points in the quarter \u2013 the answer is no, it was a little less than that.  In Q1 we were mid-single digits but we said we were at the lower end of the range of mid-single digits, and in this quarter we slipped to what we call low-single digits.  But the impact, the change wasn\u2019t in the 3% category; it was much lower than that.","How did it develop from Q1 to Q2?  I think there has been some slowing of the market from the result of the two other implant companies that have reported.  I would say the slowing has been most notable in the US, although the regional growth rates kind of remain what they were and that is the rest of the world category is the highest growth rates, the US is next and Europe seems to be flat to down and that continued in Q2.  So I think that the European market in total is contracting although it varies widely by country or by geographic region with the southern part of Europe being most impacted.","As far as how this was impacted by the Astra Tech integration, it\u2019s hard to say.  We had our reps out in the field doing training; we had changes in territories, some changes in customer relationships \u2013 that\u2019s always very, very difficult although we go about it in a very thoughtful way I think in how we do these integrations.  We don\u2019t rush to judgment on how it\u2019s going to be done but really work through the details before we implement.  So I think it does have an impact but we think we\u2019ve managed our way through it pretty well.  ","And your last question was what are our expectations.  At this point I would expect the US market to continue to grow, if I had to guess kind of mid-single digits for the balance of the year.  I think Europe in total is probably going to continue to contract slightly for the rest of the year, and outside of those two regions in the rest of the world category I think we\u2019ll see some continued pretty strong growth.  That was a lot to go through, did I-","[Eden Ling] \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I appreciate it; you covered everything.  So just a clarification on the US expectations for [integrating] mid-single digit.  Is that how it ended in Q2 or will that indicate a further slowdown from where we were in Q2?","Bret Wise","If I had to guess, I mean I\u2019ll know more when we see Nobel and [Strawman] report but if I had to guess I would say that the US market today is growing somewhere between let\u2019s say 4% and 7%.  And I\u2019m kind of expecting that to continue.","[Eden Ling] \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then a question on the non-dental part of the Astra Tech business.  How did that business do in the quarter and do you expect to release any new products at the upcoming [ICECOF] conference in September in London?","Bret Wise","Okay, that business is doing very well.  It continues to perform very well and meet our expectations.  We do like that market.  It\u2019s a very stable growth market, good consumable products, many of them single-use and so we do find that attractive.  I\u2019m not going to comment on new product launches.  We tend to not do that for our dental business or this new business in advance of them being shown and launched at shows because we\u2019d just as soon wait for that so I\u2019m not going to comment on that.  But this is a mid-single digit growth business.  It would have been accretive to our growth rate if it had been in internal growth for this quarter and it continues to perform very well.","[Eden Ling] \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Green with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for the questions.  Operating margins came in ahead of what we were estimating.  Could you estimate some attribution for how much of the operating margin expansion year-over-year was due to some of the main factors you highlighted such as strong execution in the base business versus temporary inventory absorption or FX or Astra or however you\u2019d like to outline it?","Bill Jellison","Well I think we\u2019ve said the Astra Tech mix is definitely a positive but even excluding the Astra Tech mix we were nicely positive for both our base business which includes both a slight benefit from the FX impact \u2013 FX was probably in the 20, 30 basis points improvement in that rate or so.  But keep in mind that that\u2019s a positive on gross margin rate but it\u2019s a negative on the bottom line because of the translation impact.  ","But apart from that the base business still performed very nicely and I\u2019d say that that probably falls into two parts: both because of some additional favorable mix with some of the businesses that performed well in the period but also because as we talked about some of the additional overhead absorption that\u2019s taken place because of the inventory build also benefited that rate a little bit.  And that piece of it we would expect to kind of fall back out in the back half of the year.","Bret Wise","Just to clarify, I think the ET was probably diluted.  It was diluted in terms of the mix impact on operating margins but accretive on the gross profit line, just to clarify.","Bill Jellison","All those comments that I just made were gross profit-related.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, okay. Can you make some of the same comments on operating margins?  So remind us on how you reported what the improvement was year-over-year in operating margin and then if you could give some sort of attribution as best you could on that line item?","Bill Jellison","Sure.  The operating margin was actually down year-over-year by about 30 basis points.  Virtually all of that and then some was because of the mix from Astra Tech.  The broader based base business also performed better at the operating margin rate, and we also as Bret mentioned had a nice operating margin rate improvement sequentially between Q1 and Q2.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then how do you see that trending moving forward?","Bill Jellison","Well, we obviously don\u2019t make projections on kind of what we see moving forward associated with that but I\u2019d say a couple comments that we did make.  One is that on the gross margin rate you should still see a favorable mix obviously occurring in Q3 because the Astra Tech acquisition will then be fully integrated into both base periods where Q4 will then show year-over-year comps that are equivalent to each other.  But then we would also expect that from a broader based operating margin rate that you\u2019re probably still going to see an operating margin rate drag in Q3 again because of some of the comps on both the ortho business and also the Astra Tech business; but then beginning in Q4 you should begin to see some year-over-year improvements again.","Bret Wise","This is Bret.  I\u2019ll add to that because this is an important point.  With the large business in Europe or a large complement of our business in Europe, historically what we\u2019ve seen is operating margins will decline sequentially from Q2 to Q3 because you have less sales and you\u2019ve got the same fixed costs.  And we would expect that to happen again this year.  We would expect operating margins sequentially to moderate a little bit in Q3 and then go back up in Q4.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful.  And then the last quarter or two you mentioned in rest of world that dealer inventories were a bit higher and you were working on lowering those inventories by raising prices.  I was hoping you could give us an update on where you believe inventories in those couple regions stand, and if you believe that the rest of world growth this quarter is kind of a true run rate number that we should think about going forward?","Chris Clark","Scott, it\u2019s Chris.  I think it\u2019s pretty indicative.  We again, it\u2019s such a broad geographic area that you\u2019ve got some puts and takes but I would say in aggregate we believe that the channel inventories in the quarter ended the quarter about where they started and you know, from that standpoint I think that growth rate is pretty indicative of what we think the sell through in aggregate was.  Again, in individual countries there may be a little give and take due to some promotional timing.  But by and large I think that\u2019s pretty indicative.","Bret Wise","And Scott, I\u2019d add to that that we did have those two countries in Q4 we said we were bringing inventory down; and then in Q1 this year we had one of those countries still liquidating inventory in this channel.  But I think that\u2019s run its course now.","Bill Jellison","Yeah, I think one other point to just make there is that as Chris and Bret mentioned before you know, no real change in inventory levels within the quarter in comparison to a year ago and the changes that were made in that same quarter.  And the second point is that inventory in the channel is definitely noticeably lower at the end of Q2 2012 than it was at the end of Q2 2011.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, maybe if I can just elaborate a little bit more on some of the comments you made on Europe.  I mean you gave us a fair amount of detail on the US market but can you elaborate a little bit more on Europe in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the growth rate there this quarter versus last quarter?  I mean clearly there\u2019s a lot of government sponsored healthcare over there but are you seeing anything in terms of austerity measures, anything that makes you incrementally more cautious or more optimistic as we approach the second half?","Bret Wise","That\u2019s a great question, Glen, and almost unexpectedly we don\u2019t see a lot of difference.  If you look at where our growth rates were kind of by category \u2013 it was mid-single digits in the specialties, it was mid-single digits in the consumables and it was slightly negative in lab but that was because the alloy market continues to contract, and without alloys we were positive in lab and continue to be.  ","I think it\u2019s important to probably point out that if you go back and look at the comps in Europe they were a lot tougher in the first half of the year, the period we now have behind us, and they\u2019ll get easier in the back half of the year.  So although we\u2019re not really encouraged that they\u2019re sorting out the economic problems there we view our own business as pretty stable.  We know it\u2019s growing well above market and we look to continue to take market share in the back half of this year.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then maybe if I can just ask one follow-up: I mean a lot of questions on the Astra Tech acquisition.  Now that you\u2019ve almost anniversaries that announcement, a year ago you kind of gave us the initial guidance that it would be about $0.12 to $0.17 accretive.  Have you pretty much been right in line with your original expectations?  Has it been a little bit better, a little bit worse?  How would you sort of characterize it almost a year in?","Bret Wise","I would characterize it overall we\u2019re in line with all the expectations that we put forth for the business.  Operationally we\u2019re doing very well.  The integration is going well and we\u2019re moving along there.  Certainly one negative I would say is I would say the implant market is probably not growing as fast as we had anticipated at the time of launch.  We\u2019ve got some levers we can pull to kind of offset that, and the synergy potential here is high and perhaps higher than we thought originally.  So on balance we view the acquisition very positively.  It\u2019s delivering value.  ","We\u2019re always at some point at the whims of the market here and would feel a lot better if the dental implant market was growing double digits but it\u2019s simply not growing double digits right now so we have to manage within that environment.  And I think that we\u2019re doing reasonably well.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks for the comments.","Operator","At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Derek Leckow","Well thank you everyone for the good questions.  That concludes our conference call today.  Thanks for your interest in DENTSPLY and if you have any additional questions I\u2019m around to take your calls.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joshua Zable, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Joshua Zable","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. I'd like to remind you that an earnings press release is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement in our earnings press release. During today's conference call we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And, with that, I will now turn the program over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.","Don Casey","Thanks Josh and good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us today. It has been an important quarter for me as I continue to meet with our critical customers, KOLs, practitioners, and most importantly our thousands of dedicated employees around the world. Throughout all these conversations I am reminded that this is a great category and we are well positioned in it. We have powerful brands, important technology and a truly global footprint.","Our view and those of our critical stakeholders is that the basic fundamentals of the category remain positive, that there is a healthy underlying demand for dental products and the innovation is rewarded, and new technologies, many of which of ours are really advancing the profession. It is clear that we also need to move our focus from putting two great companies together and begin to focus much more on the customer and how we deliver on our role as being the dental solutions company.","One of the final critical observations from the past three months is that the market is evolving particularly in the U.S. It is very clear that Dentsply Sirona will need to adapt to these conditions in order to consistently grow faster than the market. This is highlighted by results in the quarter. In Q1 we saw solid performance in many regions and businesses weighed down by significant headwinds in the U.S. technologies and equipment businesses.","On our first quarter call we said that we will judge our success by our ability to return the company to reliable topline growth and improve our margins, that our growth program would be built around three areas; improving our sales force effectiveness, delivering our innovation agenda and focusing on growth in the countries and regions that are seeing rapid economic development.","During this quarter significant pro progress was made on these priorities, but they are not quick fixes. We also indicated that a prerequisite to growth would be improving the performance of our technologies and equipment business in the U.S. To deliver against that objective, we have developed and are investing in strategies and programs designed to help us own the responsibility for demand creation. Comprehensive in nature, these efforts will augment those of our value to dealer\/partners.","Highlights of the program includes stronger marketing and communication programs and a commitment to hiring 50 additional reps beginning in the second quarter. This program will also include aggressive supplemental selling efforts that will involve multiple parts of the Dentsply Sirona field organization as well as some other dealer initiated programs. It is designed to reinforce the powerful potential of these products and help our dealers accelerate sales.","Based on what we have seen around the world, these products have a lot of runway in front of them. They deliver remarkable patient and dentist satisfaction and we expect them to be a strong source of growth in the future. Beyond this, our general sales force effectiveness program continues to highlight the significant upside that exists across the entire business.","We are in the process of assessing and augmenting the skills, capabilities, and performance of our over 4000 sales people globally by rolling out programs like salesforece.com as well as other tools including clinical and product training as part of a broader program designed to improve our go to market capabilities to deliver consistent above market growth going forward.","A key differentiator for Dentsply Sirona is our commitment to clinical education. While some talk about it, we delivered. Later this month, we will open a state-of-the-art training center in Charlotte, North Carolina that will help us reach over 10,000 dental professionals per year. Between this and our European center in Bensheim, Germany and over a dozen satellite facilities around the world, we will directly talk to over 25,000 practitioners a year, supplementing our continuing education efforts that reach over hundreds of thousands of dentists annually. We look forward to welcoming you to our new Dental Academy for an Investor Day on September 27, so you can see this impressive facility first had.","The second part of our growth initiatives for improving our topline will be innovation. We spend over $150 million annually in R&D and believe that we have a very robust pipeline. Our laser team is spending a considerable amount of time with the teams to make sure that we are accelerating major innovations that can drive share and margin. Our efforts also go beyond internal development and include acquisitions.","As you saw, we closed on the OraMetrix transaction last week and we are really excited about this acquisition. This is much more than a clear line program. It combines a comprehensive software and manufacturing platform that can create real root to ground [ph] treatment options for the dentist. OraMetrix uniquely integrates digital scanning, 2 and 3D x-rays to create customized individual treatment plans for orthodontic patients. The software can plan cases using brackets and wires as well as clear liners to offer the clinician flexible and broad range of treatment options.","This past weekend at the American Association of Orthodontists Dentsply Sirona launched a full clear liner and integration of OraMetrix and Omnicam. The reception was very positive and shows the power of Dentsply Sirona equipment, software, and clinical education offerings. Across our entire portfolio we expect to launch over 30 major products this year and expect to be very competitive at the key idea show in March of next year.","Finally we said that we want to grow in growing markets. It is important to note in this most recent quarter critical markets in Europe and Asia showed solid growth in this past quarter. We expect the growth to not only continue, but to pick up throughout this year. We believe we have the right products, a solid commercial footprint and will make the investments necessary to build sustainable growth.","Examples of these investments represented robust clinical education and creating meaningful training facilities in places like Vietnam and Indonesia or expanding our selling organizations in high potential markets. As I stated on our last call in addition to growth the second area that is important to me is improving our margins. There are several ways to do this and one of the most critical is cost initiatives. Our entire leadership team is committed to the goal of saving $100 million by 2019 and we feel good about the progress we have made.","It has not all translated into operating margin expansion this year as we are looking to make investments like OraMetrix and our program to accelerate our technology and equipment businesses. As the company continues to address the need for additional capabilities, we want to have the flexibility to make those types of decisions. Going forward though we expect to deliver savings in areas where we can operate at scale and improve our competitiveness and cost positions. Whether it is procurement, manufacturing, logistics or other areas of SG&A the team here is very focused on taking full advantage of our scale and we have made significant moves in this area that will begin showing up in 2019.","I will let Nick us through some of those key initiatives a little bit later. The final commitment I discussed in that first call was a desire of this management team to be transparent and accountable. As you saw in the press release yesterday, we are adjusting our guidance to reflect what we saw in the first quarter and more importantly outlining investments and actions we are taking to return us to growth. Our updated range reflects our full year expectations and provides us the flexibility to make the tough decisions that will help us build a solid foundation for future growth.","It is also important to note that our Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization by $500 million bringing our total authorization to $1 billion. This underscores our commitment to our shareholders. As we go forward I am truly grateful to our tremendous employee base and their unswerving commitment to our company. It is their passion and desire to win that makes me believe that we will return this company to sustainable growth going forward.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Nick Alexos, who will provide a more detailed look into our results and our underlying assumptions for 2018 outlook. Nick?","Nick Alexos","Thanks Don and good morning everyone. I want to echo Don's remarks about the range of opportunities and the progress we are making. For the first quarter, constant currency total sales decreased 1.1% driven by technologies and equipment which declined by 1.7%. The technology and equipment segment was impacted by approximately $8 million of dealer inventory reductions in the order and we continued to target $40 million of such reductions in 2018.","Consumables declined slightly this quarter driven by shortfall in the U.S. We believe that the consumables grew at a better than market rate in Europe and the rest of world. Regionally, the U.S. was down 7.4% driven by declines in technologies and equipment. Consumables in the U.S. declined as they were impacted by a number of factors. We had some orders pulled forward in Q4 2017 and added strong year-over-year comparable in our instrument business.","We've seen improvement in sales in the recent months and are confident in our rest of the year growth rate. We continue to view the U.S. dental market as stable and we expect the initiatives that Don spoke about will improve our performance in the rest of 2018 and provide momentum for 2019.","In Europe, our low sales growth was impacted by consumables which had a difficult comparable due to the timing of the Easter holiday this year. In Europe the technologies and equipment business faced a difficult comparison due to last year's IDS results and had a slight impact by the dealer inventory reductions in that geography. We are seeing solid demand for technology and equipment products in Europe.","In the rest of the world, constant currency growth rates of 5.3% was driven by both consumables and technology and equipment performance. We believe this reflects the exceptional strength of our products, brands, clinical education, and direct sales and marketing efforts. As Don mentioned, driving growth in these developing geographic markets is a priority.","We are confident our overall sales performance will improve sequentially as we move through the year, but we have reduced our revenue forecast to reflect the near-term underperformance of the U.S. technologies and equipment business. We expect growth in both Europe and the rest of the world as I mentioned to continue.","Turning to margins for the quarter, adjusted non-GAAP operating margin declined to 14.5% versus 16.6% a year ago as lower sales worked against our fixed cost and product mix weighed negatively on margins. Also as we mentioned on our last call, we are seeing some foreign exchange headwinds due to our non-dollar base costs. We are not seeing any significant change in our overall pricing environment however. As Don mentioned, we are on track for our cost savings which will ramp up throughout the year. We plan to see margin benefits in 2019.","Q1 adjusted EPS was $0.45. Cash flow from operating activities was $55.2 million down 33% percent versus prior year which was impacted by Q1 operating results and an increase in our own inventories. We are aiming to reduce our current inventory levels by at least $30 million by the end of the year. As we said operating cash flow is an important indicator of the health of the business and an area we can improve.","CapEx was $35.8 million for the quarter up from last year's $31.1 million. We continue to expect the CapEx for the year will be similar to 2017 and we will monitor our spend to ensure that we are delivering appropriate returns. On May 1, as you've seen, we closed on the acquisition of OraMetrix for $90 million in cash with an additional potential earn out payments of $60 million. We expect to hit the milestones and pay the earn outs in 2018 or by early 2019.","During the quarter we were unable to repurchase any of our shares. The filing of our 10-K coincided with the blackout period. As Don mentioned, we have increased our share buyback authorization to reflect our commitment to returning dollars to shareholders.","Now turning to guidance, our guidance includes the following assumptions. Full-year constant currency sales growth is now 2% which reflects the lower Q1 results and implies around 2.5% internal growth rate for the remainder of the year plus about $20 million of revenue from OraMetrix. At the current exchange rate this translates to approximately reported revenues in the range of $4.2 billion.","As I mentioned, our revenue assumptions assume the $40 million targeted reduction in dealer equipment inventory which is costing us about 1% internal growth rate and we are on track to reduce most of that in the first half of 2018. Please note that given the targeted dealer inventory reductions in the first half will have an impact on our Q2 results and therefore Q2 will be at a lower internal growth rate than the full year amount.","We expect 2018 full-year operating margins to be down between 100 and 150 basis points versus last year which is net of the targeted cost reductions that we will achieve. This is a function of the FX headwinds in our cost, higher operating costs and lower sales, and higher investment spending related to the gross initiatives in the rest of the year. As Don mentioned earlier, we are committed to delivering $100 million in operating cost savings by fiscal year end 2019 and we're on track to realize $50 million of actual savings this year.","I'd like to take a minute to put some context around our cost savings effort and provide some details. During the first quarter of this year we successfully closed our dental handpiece manufacturing operations in Des Plaines, Illinois. The production was moved to a much larger handpiece manufacturing operation in Bensheim, Germany to leverage existing infrastructure and more advanced production technology.","In Q3 of this year we will complete the consolidation of our German distribution facility into our European distribution hub in Venlo, the Netherlands. This is yet another project that will drive savings beginning in 2019. We've also been consolidating into a distribution center here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. These initiatives are in line with our strategy to streamline our global distribution network and our supply chain.","These are just a few examples of projects that will improve the operations of the business and drive cost savings. Given the sensitive nature of some of our additional projects we will continuously update you on them as they are implemented.","On taxes, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 is 21.4%, a slight improvement from the targeted 22% we initially expected. As we stated on our last call, this rate is based on the changes in the U.S. tax legislation which reduced our foreign tax credits and limit our abilities to defer foreign tax income. Please note, only 30% of our revenues are from the U.S.","Lastly, our guidance does reflect the use of excess cash in 2018 to buy back stock. Based on the timing of these purchases, we may incur limited expense that would partially offset some of the EPS accretion in 2018. There are clearly many variables to our EPS guidance throughout the income statement which we manage. As a result of these variables we revised our guidance of our non-GAAP EPS to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 from the previous range of $2.70 to $2.80. This compares to the $2.66 realized in 2017 which had the benefit of the lower effective tax.","The primary drivers of the $0.15 difference in the revised guidance at the midpoint are as follows. The acquisition of OraMetrix and subsequent operating expenses to grow that business will cost us about $0.03 to $0.04 of dilution to the adjusted EPS. Our lower sales outlook and newly identified OpEx investment, net cost reductions, will impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.11 to $0.13. Offsetting these is a slightly better tax rate that should add about $0.02.","Overall, although we are disappointed to not have foreseen the shortfalls in Q1, we're seeing good progress on our sales strategies and cost initiatives in our guidance reflect these key decisions.","I will now turn the call over to Don for some final remarks.","Don Casey","Thank Nick. I want to end by reiterating that we understand the importance of our credibility with our investors and take this very seriously. As we look at the first quarter results and the action we wanted to take we made a decision to invest in the long-term value creation. This business is stable but has been stuck in neutral for two years. To reignite growth we are taking the necessary actions even though they will weigh on this year's results.","We would expect to exit the year with the normalized run rate of growth with opportunity to accelerate the topline growth next year. We will leverage our cost savings going forward to drive margin expansion and faster earnings growth. These actions will enable long-term sustainable top and bottom-line growth which will create significant value for our shareholders. We expect to see improvement as early as next quarter and promise to update you on our progress as we move throughout the year.","We will provide more details on our long-term plans at the analyst day in September. We are eager to host you at our new Charlotte training facility to help make some of the investment tangible for your and we encourage all of you to join us.","Before closing, I want to underscore our team's optimism about our future. This is a strong company that is well positioned. We are taking important steps today that will enhance our growth for years to come.","I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Hello and good morning and thanks for the time here. What I'd like to do is to the extent that I can, make sure that I have a little depth of understanding of how you see the hardware launch particularly in digital playing out over the next year or two. So it's a two-parter, one for Don, you proactively addressed IDS 2019. As you lookat IDS 2019 as those of us who covered Sirona for a long time and we think back the days of Omnicam launches and DSL [ph] and it's been a few years. Are those reasonable predicates for us to think about the scale or the opportunities you see for IDS 2019?","And then just a housekeeping item also related to hardware for Nick, is it fair to say that now that we're five months into the year and you've reiterated expectation for the $40 million that your confidence in the 40s is going higher not lower? Thanks so much.","Don Casey","Yes, I'll go first. Thanks for the questions Steve. You know obviously the technology and equipment business it's important that we play our cards very close to the vest, otherwise you wind up seeing sales deteriorating as you get closer and closer to IDS. I would tell you is that the vast amount of time we're spending in our R&D efforts right now are really focused on digital dentistry. We continue to think there's a lot of runway there. We recognize that our products need to be updated not only from a hardware perspective, but also software and its ability to connect with the dentist as well as some of the practice management systems. So we're focusing on making sure that A, we've got good hardware, B, that our software is really updated and then see if its connected and works well in all the workflows around the world. So without trying to tip our hand we're pretty comfortable that we got a robust portfolio we think will be very competitive at IDS, but we also want to be careful about basically postponing any sales between now and that.","Nick Alexos","Steve on the $40 million the answer is yes we feel very confident. That's a number that we can largely manage. It is an important number not only for us but for our dealer\/partners and as I stated we expect most of that to be realized through the end of Q2.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning guys. Can you hear me okay?","Don Casey","Yes, Jeff. How are you?","Jeff Johnson","I\u2019m well Don, thank you. So couple questions here. Let me, I guess just one question. Nick I did not hear a U.S. Technology numbers simple math would have it down in the double digits just can you confirm or give any color there?","But more importantly Don, on that point can you bucket for us and I think I've asked you this before but just kind of as technology declines in the double digits in the U.S., how much of that is just the disruption that is out there in your dealer channel, how much is out there or just kind of end markets, where they are at in the U.S. growing or not growing, and then how much might be a structural shift? If some dentists move away from CAD\/ CAM or maybe more held in on CAD\/CAM today because of growing popularity of DI, do you have the right product there and how much is that more so that even the dealer disruption impacting the U.S. number? Thank you.","Nick Alexos","Hey, Jeff, it's Nick quickly, as you know we don't give by geography, by segment growth rates, but I think, you can get a sense that the proponents of our disappointment is in the U.S. Technology business therefore it performed less than the consumable business which is why we're doing some of the things that Don talked about.","Don Casey","Yes and Jeff that's a complex question and you've been consistent in asking it, so let me try and break it down. I mean obviously, the most significant change in our go-to-market strategy over the last two years has been going from a proprietary relationship with one dealer into the fact that there are multiple dealers that now carry our equipment in North America, and there's obviously been transitions at those dealers.","Look, long term we feel very good about what the dealers are doing. We feel they are integral to our go-to-market strategy and provide real value to us and we're going to continue to work with them. That being said, a lot of our conversations with the dealers and obviously we talk to these guys a lot, has been - they really would like us to prime the pump a little bit more and you can see the programs we're putting into place are really designed in my opinion to go and create more awareness, more demand creation, because I disagree with you a little bit that, people are moving away from CAD\/CAM.","I actually - we've done a lot of work with dentists that have this product. They think it is terrific and are highly satisfied. What we need to do is, convince more dentists that the benefits to the patient in terms of one visit dentistry as well as the absolute great product they get when it's actually personalized, personally developed for them right there at the dentist chair side is a great outcome.","We need to convince more dentist that that is a viable opportunity and it's one that's not only going to be important for their future growth, but also delivers real value. When you mentioned DI, look I think our DI strategy has been weak to be honest with you. We've now spent a fair amount of time putting together what we believe is a very competitive program that we're in the process of launching. As a matter of fact at the AAO show this last weekend you're beginning to see stuff like OraMetrix where we're beginning to use Omnicam as a DI device that will help with OraMetrix. So we believe that our product is terrific. We need to actually go represent that it could be the beginning of a journey to chair side dentistry, so start with Omnicam and move up.","And I don't think we've done enough to support that. I think we will be doing a lot more as we go forward. But ultimately what we and we get asked this a lot, what we see around the world where there's still higher penetrations of CAD\/CAM than what we see in the U.S. is we believe it's up to us to create demand and make this product more relevant and prime the pump.","Joshua Zable","Next question please?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. I want to ask on consumables, I think people are expecting the technology is fine, but consumables were soft. You highlighted the order go forward in the fourth quarter and a difficult comp, but just curious, can you talk little bit more about, how you're feeling on consumables exiting the quarter and have your assumptions changed for the remainder of the year on consumables?","And then just stepping back, you did okay, got lowered the numbers on the quarter and you haven't changed your destocking assumptions so can you maybe just talk a little bit about what did change in guidance for the remainder of the year?","Nick Alexos","Yes, so Tycho on the first point, I'd say overall we're seeing good signs on consumables and really view the comparative percentages, more as a result of the pull forward and just the year-over-year comparables as we noted a little bit on the instrument side, so overall we feel pretty good. We're not seeing any real concerns in the recent periods.","In terms of the deal reduction that is our target. We feel that's a good number and we think that on top of that we will be able to achieve better performance in the technology and equipment business globally as well as hopefully in the U.S. during the rest of the year. So we're not changing our dealer inventory target number.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks, good morning. I guess following up a little bit on that question on consumables, any color you can give us sort of by product line give us a sense of how Implants has continued to perform in particular and perhaps an update on where the sales force is today so far as cross selling or their ability to score wins from selling work flow solutions?","Don Casey","Yes, thanks Brandon for the good questions. First, what we're seeing in consumables obviously we don't break out the lines. We've mentioned a couple times that there was a comp on the instrument business related to the CDC [indiscernible] last year about how to deal with infection prevention, so that's the first point.","Second point on implants, we're starting to see signs of life in our implant business. We expect that we're going to be announcing a sequence of leadership changes in the not too distant future as the leader of that business retires and we believe that we've lined up a very effective leadership team. We just made a change in the U.S. that we think is essential to begin to propel that business going forward.","So right now with the implant business, again we feel that we've got a pretty good lineup of products. I don't think we've done a particularly good job on delivering our message and capitalizing on all that we have to offer. You bring up perhaps the most important point in my mind at the end there in terms of how are we doing in the cross selling. It is interesting when we begin to see stuff like OraMetrix and Omnicam, when when we begin to talk about our implant business with some of the DI products that we actually have we get very, very excited about it and we've seen in different parts of the world pockets where this works well.","What we haven't been able to do and when we talk about sales force effectiveness is how do we institutionalize that and make it systemic, how do we make sure that everyone in our Endo sales force is conscious of what equipment is used in that doctor's office. And as such, when we talk about this idea of sales force effectiveness, one of the key pillars of that is how do we cross sell.","So I would say that we are in a very, very early stage, but one of the great promises of putting Dentsply with Sirona is the idea that we will have a complete portfolio that we will be able to talk to a dentist across a number of different procedures and it's up to us to actually deliver a sales force that can help that dentist think about procedures, think about how it works into their workflow and we can do that uniquely because we're going to be bringing them a full portfolio of products that our reps can talk about. So I would say we are seeing signs that this is a very positive development around the world. We need to institutionalize that and that's a critical priority in our sales force effectiveness program.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning Don and Nick. Thanks for taking the question. Couple for us, I think first, I think Nick in your prepared comments, I think this was in relation to equipment sales. I think you made a comment about there were better trends in more recent months, I was wondering if may be you can just and get a little more color on what you were seeing in that regard?","Nick Alexos","Well, specifically exactly that Steve we have seen better trends in recent months. As a matter of fact I was at the AAO this weekend and just as Don mentioned, I think people are seeing the value of our Omnicam unit in a DI setting and we're seeing good momentum on our broader Chairside business as well, so exactly that Steve.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Good morning. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Don, you talked about bringing on the 50 additional sales reps, I think largely on the equipment side in 2Q. Given that you do sell through distribution partners in the U.S. as well as a number of other markets, can you talk about what the opportunities are for your reps that kind of come on and have an impact on sale rates on the equipment side and how do you expect them to compliment the selling efforts going on at your distribution partners?","Don Casey","Yes, thanks Nathan. Look when we think about the technology and equipment business you have to go through a couple phases where there's obviously awareness create awareness and interest in the products, then there's a qualification, then qualification you usually need a demonstration to get people excited about what the product can do and how it would work in their office and then basically you need to close.","The program we're putting together as I did we're trying to identify ways that we prime the pump and we create more awareness and interest. Then as we begin to qualify them and want to do the demonstrations we're in a position right now by adding reps that if there is a need for anybody to get a demonstration immediately we will be right there. So we're not totally reliant on when can we get this rep or that rep from this company in there and do the closing.","The other thing that we want to talk about is, we think that there are places where there's a great conversation to be had with large group practices some of these big market DSOs that today we're not covering as aggressively as we should be, where we can actually bring the message of what Chairside dentistry, what some of the advantages of tone BMRs, they begin to look at different procedures that they can do within their DSO and we're not covering them today so we want to cover that.","So we are looking at the reps principally as helping immediately qualify and do demonstrations as well as reach people that we haven't been typically focused on in terms of some of the kind of the mid market DSOs and other large group practices where we think our Chairside message should be extremely relevant and should have real economic viability for them.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Well take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan Block","Hey guys good morning. I'll ask one question two parts though. So just first talking about value but handful of good thing for \u201919 Don you mentioned accelerating revenue growth there's opportunities in OpEx. How do we think about gross margin? Nick, if emerging increases as a percent of revenue, I guess Nick is there that long term opportunity in gross margin as well?","And then just a follow up on DI and I really don't mean to sound too aggressive, but it does seem like Sirona, the innovator if you would embattle [ph] was really behind on a critical DI product cycle and DI is out there in a lot of places were sort of sub $30,000 and others are bundling it. So can you guys be a little bit more specific on what you're going to do there to better compete, is it price or bundling you talked at that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Nick Alexos","So I'll go quickly and I appreciate the double questions, sorry I didn\u2019t give Steve [indiscernible] the opportunity earlier, but so I would say that we view the opportunity to leverage our fixed costs as very real, obviously that worked against us in Q1 given the lower sales level, but we view that as an opportunity.","And then secondly, as I did highlight some of the things that we're doing we'll get directly to reducing our operating cost structure like consolidating distribution centers in Europe, in the U.S. as well as to some degree manufacturing facilities which obviously take a little bit of a longer lead time. So we do see operating leverage both at the gross profit and the SG&A level over time and that's clearly part of our cost savings as well as where we're looking to consolidate operations.","Don Casey","Yes and Jon again well played on the double question. Look on the DI product cycle, first I would debate a little bit. We think our Omnicam product is terrific when used as a DI and actually one of the things that we are now talking about extensively internally is let's get Onmnicam out aggressively because we believe that that's the beginning of the journey that will take people to Chairside dentistry.","And again we think your Chairside dentistry is really important. It's got economic benefits that are still very important to the dentist and to be honest in a world where people are time constrained, doing a one visit crown procedure we think is very viable. But I would agree with you that we probably have been a cycle slow in terms of marketing our product is DI and you mentioned that there are people out there sub $30,000.","I think the actual price is less relevant than how they're going about it and in terms of let's get an [indiscernible] out and monetize that on clear liners or some other ways. We believe we have a first a really competitive product. Second, we think that we actually have a portfolio that can help make that very, very relevant whether it's through incentives to use our implants with our equipment or our equipments with implants. We believe we have a lot of opportunities that we're again, we're starting to push around the world with a reasonably good level of success and that is a high priority for us to get after in the back half of the year.","So we have spent a lot of time talking about what we think DI is. Ultimately we think, A, we have a competitive product, B it's important get that product out more broadly because we believe it\u2019s the beginning of a journey to Chairside dentistry and C, we believe that we actually have a portfolio that would allow us to combine our Omnicam as the DI product with other products in our portfolio that we think should be very, very relevant to practitioners all around the world.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Thanks. Don, I think at the beginning of the call you talked about an evolving market particularly in the U.S., can you just go back to that and expand on it? What sort of structural changes are you seeing in dental particularly in the U.S. and what do you need to do to sort of get out in front of those changes? Thanks.","Don Casey","Yes, thanks John and what I was referencing look, if you actually take a big step back over the last few years, two years ago there was Sirona dealing with a single distributor, then we merged and we did Dentsply Sirona, obviously there's been some changes with Paterson [ph] and obviously the market evolved to the point where there are now multiple dealers carrying multiple pieces of equipment.","So you go from where the market was relatively clearly defined in terms of what everybody's role was in terms of selling Sirona equipment to today obviously our dealers carry multiple lines of equipment and right now some of that activity that they are expending goes to explaining the differences between one piece of equipment and another. There is not then in my opinion as much effort spent on how are we priming the pump, how are we every day trying to bring 100 new doctors into Chairside dentistry and actually getting the demo. So in our conversations with our dealer partners they have been both very clear that they are excited about our equipment.","Again, we think our equipment is second to none whether that's in CAD\/CAM whether that's in the 2D or 3D XRAY cone beam areas or whether that's even in DI. What we need to do is we need to take more ownership we're creating ultimate demand for the product. We need to be creating the category of which we still have by far the largest share. So what you hear us talking about John, as we go through this program is again we sat there and said we're talking about marketing programs that are going to enhance communications deliver and talk about the benefits of these specific products.","We're going to be working with the dealers from how do we take that interest and begin to qualify some of these opportunities more aggressively and then by having additional people on the street, we think we can get to a more personalized demo very, very quickly where we can now bring them down to our Charlotte facility and work on closing.","So again, two years seems like a long time, but it's really not. We've gone from a single company with a single distributor to a merged company that's now dealing with multiple dealers carrying multiple products. And I think over the - our expectation is we, in our case as we are now well through the idea that we've done a merger and we're now focusing on our customers, we expect the dealers as they get more comfortable and proceed to getting very used to selling multiple pieces of equipment, we think the market will return to something that looks a little bit more like it has historically.","The biggest difference in our mind is that we're going to be taking a lot more ownership and spending in our minds correctly to kind of prime the pump in a way that we're going to increase demand for whether Chairside dentistry, whether it's cone beam or whether it's DI.","Nick Alexos","The other thing I would add John is you\u2019ve also seen with the digital technologies that we\u2019ve led with in a very specific manner expanding the ability of general practitioners to do more specialty procedures. Certainly that improves the revenue in their practice. I would say that that also requires a high level of clinical education and as Don has highlighted, our new facility in charlotte is going to compliment our other facilities around the world to really be a leader in that clinical education which we think is very important content to have as part of what we\u2019re bringing to the market.","So I would say, you\u2019re seeing more and more GPs who want to expand to specialty procedures, but they need the training and will leverage our products is another key trend that\u2019s evolved in the marketplace that we hope to future capitalize on.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks so much. I guess what if you've been able to accomplish in adjusting your sales force incentive structure to drive whether be it digital, standalone digital impression or better cross selling and what can you implement near term on that front and when will that really materialize?","And a follow up to an earlier question what sort of - just more broadly, what sort of topline growth do you need to have or to see any sort of meaningful margin leverage across your business over the longer term on a more normalized basis and how do you envision that longer term topline growth for the business? Thanks.","Don Casey","Yes, thanks Erin. On cross selling, look I\u2019d say it's really early. What we're doing right now is we're learning, we're painting or creating case studies that show us that we can in fact do that whether it's some of our on the Omnicam with implants, a program that we're actually executing in a couple of countries around the world right now or whether it's stuff that we just saw at orthodonture with Omnicam, with some of the stuff we're doing or metrics, where we're working through how that actually works, how we assign credit to what sales organization and how do we incentivize people to go after it.","One thing I would tell you that we are going to be able to do relatively, quickly and that should help us is we have people in dentists office all around the world virtually every day and right now they're really not in an information gathering mode. For perspective, if somebody goes in to talk to implants we'd never really ask them, hey what equipment is in there or if we have an equipment rep, who's going into a heavy implantologist, or by the way what implants they are using.","And we haven't gathered that information Erin, and we're in the process of converting that into one of the basic pieces of work that all our sales people will be doing not only in the United States but all around the world and then capturing that, processing that in such a way that becomes usable information is critical to us which is one of the reasons I referenced salesforce.com. So when we start talking about CRM and other things it becomes important to us. And I'll let Nick talk about the topline and the way to get margin level.","Nick Alexos","Yes, Erin we\u2019ve said in the past that we believe given our platform of technologies and global footprint that we should grow better than the market, so I'll leave it among all of you on the phone to figure out exactly where the market's growing globally, but we believe we should grow better.","And I also noted we're not seeing any real price erosion across our categories. So when you combine those two, we firmly believe that that targeted growth rate will achieve operating margin, gross margin improvement, but I'd like to defer to our Investor Day meeting in September after we've had a chance to really call us all our thoughts and develop our strategy to give you guys a better view in terms of our long term revenue target.","Don Casey","And margin target Nick.","Nick Alexos","And margin target, yes.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Yi Chen with H. C. Wainwright.","Yi Chen","Thank you for taking my question. By hiring additional sales reps starting in this quarter do you - does that suggest that you intend to rely less on sales force at Patterson and Henry Schein to drive topline growth?","Don Casey","No, again we look at hiring the additional reps as well as pushing through programs in a number of different areas as more priming the pump and focusing on demonstrating the product and basically moving people from the idea of interest to more qualified leads which the Patterson and Henry Schein reps will take from there. Again, we've said it we believe that our partners are delivering value and are essential to how we view our go-to-market strategy.","Joshua Zable","Next question?","Operator","And we'll take our last question from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review.","David Stratton","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. When we look at pricing you mentioned it was stable for the quarter and I was wondering if you could give some color on expectations as we move through the year and whether or not the Inventory build that you're working to take down will be impacted at all by that?","Don Casey","Yes, I\u2019d say David. Thanks for the question, but we do not see any change in the pricing environment for our products nor do we see the inventory reductions to have any impact on that overall environment. So we expect to work on the inventory as we've discussed and pricing to remain stable for our full range of products.","Operator","[Indiscernible]","Don Casey","Go ahead, you can you conclude. I was just going to say thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking again in August at the end of our Q2 with our Q2 results and we're also again very excited about the opportunity to have everyone come down to Charlotte and see what we think is a truly important initiative live and up close, so again thank you and I hope everyone has a great day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7256":["DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.

At this time, all phone participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. John Sweeney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","John Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I'd like to remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to this call are available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.","Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on our earnings press release and during today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I talk about specific results, I thought it is important to offer some perspective. We are very disappointed in the results we provided today. We take full accountability for them and we'll outline the steps we are taking today to better position this company for sustainable growth going forward.","As we've said in prior calls, there are no quick fixes or magic wands. I've been in the role for coming up on six months, and despite the results presented today, I believe there are many reasons to be optimistic about the dental market globally. The trends and fundamentals remain very attractive. Further, there is no doubt in my mind that the Dentsply Sirona company is well positioned within the industry. We have a truly global footprint, leading positions in many of the important categories with outstanding brands.","It is also clear that our structure needs to be changed in light of the current marketplace conditions and our performance over the last two years. To provide some context, Dentsply Sirona was built around 10 very strong dental business units, each responsible for R&D, manufacturing and marketing. This structure has served us well in the past but does not reflect today's customer or competitive marketplace. It led to complexity and does not help us to present one face to the customer, leverage cross-selling opportunities and has significant cost implications, whether it is in the U.S. where we have more than 15 selling organizations in the marketplace or other regions with multiple units, taking multiple approaches to the same customer. We believe that there is one customer group and we need to approach the market that way. When we do, the combined depth and breadth of Dentsply Sirona will allow us to uniquely offer meaningful solutions.","The complexity of the organization also manifests itself in the supply chain. We have over 40 manufacturing facilities and 80 distribution sites, which are mostly managed locally. For us to deliver real cost containment and enhanced customer service, we need to organize as one unit and take full advantage of the scale of the organization. There are many opportunities to recognize that we are serving one customer and that we need to operate as one company. In doing so, we should be able to create meaningful competitive advantage. Our global leadership team is undergoing a thorough review of the organization with the goal to deliver a leaner, more customer-focused business that delivers value to our customers and our investors. We expect this review to lead to a significant restructuring of the business.","As a result of that, we announced the postponement of our Investor Day. We believe it is essential to take the right amount of time in order to share a full set of conclusions and a durable path to value creation with you. We look forward to sharing those results of the diagnostic with you some time in the fourth quarter.","Now on to the quarter. In slide 7, it shows that second quarter 2018 revenues, excluding precious metals, increased by 5.1% and were up 0.9% year-over-year on an internal basis. Our reported revenue reflects positive currency impact of 3.8%. Our adjusted operating margin of 17.4% reflects a 240 basis points decline versus the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we also took a $1.3 billion impairment charge that Nick will discuss later. The company generated $117 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is down 7% as compared to the prior year. Putting this all together, our adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.60, down 8% compared to $0.65 in the prior year.","Turning to slide 8, as you know, we report across two balanced segments; Consumables and Technologies & Equipment. Our Consumables segments accounted for 48% of our revenue for the second quarter and this represents a portfolio of resilient and consistent businesses that continue to do well. Consumable revenue increased 7.6% year-over-year, up 3.3% on an internal basis, with all the business units showing positive internal growth. Our solid Consumable trends were led by a strong performance in the restorative business, which was up mid-single digits. Instruments also showed positive revenue and we saw a margin benefit associated with the consolidation of our production facilities in this area. In addition, we posted solid results in the Rest of the World, where Consumable revenue increased mid-single digits during the quarter.","Turning now to slide 9 and the Technology & Equipment business. Revenue in this segment, which accounted for 52% of revenue in the second quarter increased 2.7%, but was actually down 1.1% on an internal basis. In this segment, there are significant headwinds, the largest of the impact of dealer destocking. Year-to-date, the impact is about $34 million, which is almost at the level we had previously expected of $40 million. Working with our dealer partners, we anticipate further dealer inventory destocking to result in an additional $66 million to $76 million for the remainder of the year, for a total of $100 million to $110 million of destocking in 2018. While this has had a major impact on the quarter and the year, we believe it is the right thing to do.","A second headwind is in our Imaging business. A combination of the emergence of the value-based segment and increased functionality of lower-priced technologies has put pressure on the business. We are taking action to address these headwinds. They include an aggressive marketing campaign, adding 50 sales reps and revamping our technology pipeline. In CAD\/CAM in particular, I'm encouraged by the feedback we're getting from our dealer partners and we seem to be getting traction in the marketplace. And (7:14 \u2013 7:22) ultimately, we believe that innovation is a core tenet to improving the performance in these areas.","In Europe, equipment sales declined against a difficult comparison, as last year benefited from sales stemming from the International Dental Show. We also saw a number of positive areas in the segment. Rest of the World equipment sales showed positive growth, reflecting the global relevance and demand for our products. And importantly, our healthcare business, Wellspect, which serves the hydrophilic CIC market showed strong performance up mid-single digits. This is a business that continues to do well from a revenue and growth and profitability perspective.","Turning now to the business performance on a regional basis, U.S. revenues increased 2.3% and were up 1.3% on an internal basis. Looking out at the balance of 2018, we expect our U.S. revenues to continue to be pressured, impacted by the elevated level of dealer destocking. EMEA revenues were up 6.2%, driven by the strengthening of the dollar. On an internal basis, revenues declined 1.4%, mainly a function of the timing of IDS sales, which boosted prior-year performance. Rest of World revenues increased 7.1% with internal growth of 4%. Rest of World revenue growth benefited from the building out of our sales and service infrastructure in developing markets.","With that, I turn it over to Nick, who will take you through a deeper dive of the financials for the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Nick?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thank you, Don. If we can all turn to slide 12 of the earnings presentation, it shows non-GAAP revenues excluding precious metals increased by 5.1% in the second quarter and were up 0.9% on an internal basis. On an adjusted basis, excluding precious metal in both periods, second quarter gross profit margin was 56.9%, down 190 basis points. Gross profit margin compression was driven primarily by three factors: unfavorable mix, negative manufacturing variances and adverse pricing particularly in our Imaging business.","Total operating expenses as a percentage of sales again on an adjusted basis was 39.5%, up 50 basis points as compared to prior year due to higher marketing expenses and continued investment in R&D. Adjusted non-GAAP operating margin declined to 17.4%, down 240 basis points. The shortfall was driven by the lower gross profit margin and the higher operating expenses as percentages of sales.","We continue to make progress on our targeted $100 million cost savings initiatives and we're on track to achieve in excess of $50 million of actual savings this year with the remainder flowing into 2019. These cost savings include initiatives in Europe and in the U.S. such as consolidated distribution centers as well as to some degree manufacturing facilities, which obviously have a longer lead time. We recognize that these savings highlight the offsetting headwinds in the gross margin and operating expense trends that I mentioned.","Going forward, we expect to deliver additional savings and margin improvement as we operate at scale. Whether it's procurement, manufacturing, logistics, or other areas of selling, G&A and R&D efficiencies, our teams globally recognize the need for centralizing certain functions and sharing best practices.","On capital, we returned $250 million to the shareholders through share repurchases in the quarter. This was consistent with our strategy for using excess cash flow to buy back stock. Q2 adjusted EPS was $0.60, down compared to $0.65 in the prior quarter. EPS includes, as noted -- as will be noted in our 10-Q, a $0.05 favorable benefit from onetime stock compensation adjustment and an OPEB valuation change.","Moving on to slide 13, which includes details of our impairment. As part of U.S. GAAP, we are required to do an annual impairment testing on all our goodwill and intangibles, which we perform as part of our Q2 closing. As Don mentioned, in Q2 we took a $1.1 billion impairment charge related to the goodwill of certain of our equipment businesses within our Technology & Equipment segment, and our legacy Orthodontics business within our Consumables segment. In addition, we took $179 million impairment charge on related indefinite-lived intangibles.","The Technology & Equipment impairment was driven by lower forecasted revenues and operating margin rates for CAD\/CAM and Imaging reporting units. We saw revenue shortfall late in the second quarter and a continued disruption to our traditional growth rate trends from the 2017 change in the distribution agreements with our dealers. These forecasts also reflect increasing competitive pressures as well as recent reduction in inventory levels at our dealers in the U.S. and Europe.","As we stated in the past, we value our partnership with both Henry Schein and Patterson. And our teams are working to drive the better performance.","The CAD\/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center goodwill impairment valuation were also impacted by an increased risk premium and increased interest rates resulting in a cumulatively higher discount rate.","Overall, our projections reflect continued mid-single digit growth rates for the Technology & Equipment business, a lowering of our near-term margins, yet margin improvement over time as we continue to invest in R&D and plans for operational and supply chain savings.","In the Consumables segments, we had a $69 million goodwill impairment related to the ongoing competitive pressures in the traditional Orthodontic market. This asset has been closely monitored over the years as noted in our disclosures. And the recent inability to achieve targeted margin improvement necessitated the change in the valuation. This does not change our view of the OraMetrix business, which we acquired earlier this year and is performing quite well. OraMetrix enables us to pivot into faster growing and more profitable market segments in orthodontia.","Slide 14 shows our cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2018 was $117 million, down 7% versus prior year. Free cash flow, that is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $71.5 million in the second quarter, down 23%, and capital expenditures in the second quarter of $45.4 million were up $11.7 million or 35% year-over-year.","In 2018, capital expenditures are now expected to total $200 million, which is up as compared to the prior-year level and our previous estimate of $140 million to $150 million. The increase in our capital expenditure forecast for 2018 is due to the flow-through of 2017 capital projects into 2018, which were previously not included in our 2018 CapEx forecast. CapEx also includes investments in certain facilities around the world such as Bensheim, Germany; Charlotte, North Carolina; and M\u00f6lndal, Sweden.","Investments such as the opening of new dental academies and the consolidation of distribution centers support the strategy that Don highlights in clinical education and supply chain management. Importantly, we are now instituting a total company capital review plan as we develop these strategies going forward.","One additional initiative we have in place to improve cash flow is a detailed program to lower our inventory levels by $30 million in fiscal 2018. That's internal inventory on our balance sheet.","At the end of the second quarter, we continue to hold inventory at higher levels than 2017. Some of this is due to the elevated inventory associated with the creation of our European Consumables hub in Venlo, the Netherlands, as well as other seasonal billings.","Now, let's turn to our 2018 guidance. The revenue guidance for 2018 is now $3.95 billion or a 2% constant currency decline over 2017, which is a $250 million reduction in the previous \u2013 from the previous revenue guidance. I want to briefly address how the change in our guidance materialized.","Starting at our previous $4.2 billion revenue forecast, which we guided in May, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has reduced our revenues by $100 million. As Don also noted, in July we recognized that our dealers are seeking to significantly reduce their inventory by an additional $60 million to $70 million in 2018 versus the $40 million that we had planned, resulting in a total inventory reduction in 2018 of $100 million to $110 million.","Since we realized $34 million of dealer inventory reduction in the first half, this leaves $66 million to $76 million for the second half of this year.","The remainder of the revenue reduction of approximately $80 million was caused by a shortfall in the second quarter's results and rest of the year revenue expectations. Most of this adjustment is related to the Technology & Equipment segment.","On an adjusted basis, operating income margin was down 240 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter of 2018. Given the reduction in the expected revenue for the second half, our operating income margin guidance is now in the range of 16% to 16.5% for the full year. Depending on the expected timing of the dealer inventory reductions, we could see slightly lower operating margins in Q3 and higher in Q4. The key drivers in the margin decline are manufacturing and distribution cost variances due to the absorption costs of lower sales levels and the high fixed cost nature of our SG&A and R&D.","In addition, the margins reflect certain FX transactional rates, pricing, and promotions and onetime operating expenses that we will incur to effect the organizational changes.","The shortfall in the second half sales and the significantly larger reduction in dealer equipment inventory were not planned and as yet our cost structure does not reflect the operational savings that we will implement for 2019. As you have seen in the past, with higher second half volume levels our margins can rise materially.","Our updated EPS estimate is now $2 to $2.15, down from the previous guidance of $2.55 to $2.65. Given the uncertainty of near-term market trends for us and the plans for the organizational changes, we also chose to increase that guidance range. In terms of the reasons for the guidance reductions, the Q2 shortfall cost us about $0.05 in adjusted EPS, the second half forecast revenue lowered adjusted EPS by approximately $0.35. And in addition, we have about $0.15 reduction due to the higher expected manufacturing variances, increased distribution costs and expenditures needed to initialize our restructuring.","We clearly understand the significance of the financial adjustments and are disappointed with our visibility in certain key market trends. Nonetheless, the impacts to our results will allow for a much lower dealer inventory level going into 2019. As we develop our plans, we intend to provide our investors with an update as to the onetime nature of any costs and the longer range view of our growth and margin rates. Our tax rate assumptions for 2018 remains at 22%.","It is clear to us that we have not done a good job in managing expectations for 2018. We fully expect that the accuracy of our forecasting will improve and that we'll have a clearer line of sight into our financial performance on a quarterly basis.","I agree with Don's comments regarding the quality of our products, clinical education and the capabilities of the entire Dentsply Sirona workforce. Our commitment to our investors is that we will take the necessary actions in order to ensure that we can significantly improve our financial results and achieve higher growth, margins and cash flow.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don who will wrap up before taking your questions.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. And if we can turn to slide 17. I mentioned in the opening that we are working through a comprehensive review of the organization that will lead to a significant restructuring program. We look forward to providing details of that program at our Investor Day in the fourth quarter. But have no doubt we are and have been taking steps to improve our performance now.","This week we made significant organization changes. We named Walter Petersohn, Chief Commercial Officer. Walter brings a proven track record of performance, global experience and an intimate understanding of our equipment business to this new role. Further, Bill Newell will take on the role of Chief Segment Officer. Bill has led many of our most successful businesses at Dentsply Sirona.","We believe creating a single point of contact for our product portfolio and a single commercial leader is an important step in our restructuring. This is part of the process over the last months as a result of the elimination of over 20 senior positions in our efforts to both improve performance and address costs. As we look at building out our plans for the future, we are focused on two priorities: growth and margin enhancement. It is equally important for us to detail how we will deliver these priorities and we will highlight the need for leadership and organizational accountability, simplification and financial transparency.","A major priority for us is to restart our growth engine. We have shared the key pillars of our growth strategy with you before and they remain unchanged. They are a combination of innovation, demand creation and expansion into growth areas. Let me provide some details on each of those.","Innovation is our life blood and we will invest over $160 million in 2018 in this critical area. We believe that we are starting to see improvement in our pipeline. As an example, the Acuras Conometric Abutment in the implant area. This is a truly novel technology.","Looking to the future, our expectation is that Dentsply Sirona will have a very fulsome offering at the IDS show in Cologne in 2019. Our growth is also reliant on improving our go-to-market approach. Our organization needs to do a better job of becoming responsible for our own demand creation. This pillar includes the addition of 50 new reps in our technology business in the U.S. It also involves implementing our one customer approach, focusing on building one-to-one relationships with the dentist. We will also finish a significant sales force effectiveness program in the back half of this year that, so far, is very promising.","And we are investing in clinical education, including opening two new state-of-the-art training facilities. One in Bensheim, Germany, another in Charlotte, North Carolina. We are making changes today with urgency in order to improve our growth as quickly as possible.","The final area for growth is to continue to drive growth in markets with the highest potential. As you have seen in our results, growth in emerging markets has been a bright spot and this trend we expect to continue.","I recently visited Shanghai for our implant congress and was really impressed to see over 1,500 guests all seeking to learn more about our Astra Tech implant system and how to help doctors in the Chinese market. I firmly believe we are sitting on a real growth engine in Asia.","In addition to growth, a second priority for improvement is operating margin enhancements. Looking at this company, I see no reason that we should not be able to drive margin back to the levels at the time of the merger. This will require a major simplification effort starting with our supply chain as we've mentioned earlier. We'll move from a locally-managed set of plants and distribution centers to a single supply chain with an emphasis on logistics and inventory managed first. This will also include an evaluation of our manufacturing footprint. We believe that a unified supply chain and a simplified organization should also allow us to take a step change in the effectiveness of our procurement program. Finally, given a large SG&A budget we have, we are implementing a far more disciplined approach with an emphasis on return on investment for all these programs.","The priorities of growth and margin expansion are essential. But it's also important that we highlight how we're going to do that. A key area for improvement in our minds is organizational leadership and accountability. For the first time since the merger, Dentsply Sirona has singular leadership. We are rapidly making decisions, investing in the business, making the hard choices that will enable us to compete from a position of strength immediately. These organizational announcements that we made today show our commitment to making the appropriate changes. We have addressed underperformance in many areas. Altogether, we are building a new team that blends performers from the current organization with outside talent.","A second area is organizational simplification. As we've said, this involves moving to a single customer model across the globe, mimicking what we have seen be successful in individual countries. Additionally, we have mentioned that we're moving to a single unified supply chain, which we believe stands to yield significant cost benefits. A final area is creating financial transparency. As we will outline on Investor Day and Nick mentioned earlier today, we cannot do this behind a veil. We are committed to financial transparency and look forward to outlining a path to sustainable value creation and top-tier TSR, including metrics in which you can measure our progress.","So in conclusion, we are disappointed with our results but I want to reiterate that this team has a sense of urgency about dealing with the issues in the short term and we believe long term that we can create a company that delivers for our customers and our investors. I believe that we will unlock the full potential of a great company in an attractive market in the future. As we transition to our more efficient business model, we intend to continue to deploy capital in a way that is accretive to our shareholders. We look forward to telling you more about that in our Investor Day in the fourth quarter.","Thank you, operator, and we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Don, I want to start with the strategic review and I'm wondering if you can \u2013 it's early days, obviously, but wondering if you can give us just any more color on what that might encompass and get us comfortable with the whole notion that you can cut costs drastically while trying to restart growth and also drive margin improvement.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure, Tycho. Thanks for the question. It's really early days and I don't want to get too far in front of us in terms of outlining what the complete program looks like. But if you listen to the script, basically we're highlighting two areas. The first is on a commercial basis we think we have a lot of complexity that does not benefit our customer and we've done a pretty thorough assessment of that. We're in the process of a pretty extensive sales force effectiveness program where we think that we have the ingredients in place.","We just got to shift the focus to basically begin to talk about total Dentsply Sirona as opposed to individual franchises. And we believe that that's going to have an immediate positive benefit both from the cost structure where we're going to eliminate a lot of duplication but more importantly it's going to let us do the cross-selling that we do. So I think the combination of a more effective selling approach, better messaging, and by the way, we're starting to see some new products come out. We feel pretty good that the pillars we outlined should get the growth engine moving without a major disruption.","On a cost basis, there's two issues that we've been really focused on. And, again, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but our supply chain is complex. That's the only way I can describe it. It's 40-plus manufacturing facilities, 80-plus distribution facilities that are all pretty much locally managed, and that just does not allow us to create scale in procurement and demand planning and logistics. And we believe that, first, we're going to focus on making sure there's no interruption in customer service, but this is some relatively low-hanging fruit that we should be able to get after.","And to be honest, if you think about trying to forecast demand at 80 distribution centers all around the world, that results in complexity that has ramifications in inventory, it has ramifications in cost, and it's just not a good way to do business. So we think we can improve customer service while improving costs by moving to a much more simplified approach in supply chain. The other thing is we kind of go through the organization and again if we move to this kind of one-country formation and if we move to a far more simplified supply chain, we can simplify the organization tremendously.","Right now, we've built an infrastructure from a QRA, a finance, a legal perspective to support what is essentially 11 SBUs, and again, we believe by moving to a much more integrated model we have an opportunity to begin to really shift how we operate and we believe that that should be not only more effective but it should be a lot more efficient. So look, there's a lot of moving pieces, Tycho and one of the discussions that we've been having as an internal management team is how do we effect the change at a pace that does not impact our customers but delivers with urgency. And our intent is to spell out exactly what that looks like some time in the fourth quarter complete with the metrics. And we believe that we've got to give you guys a fair amount of metrics, so you can understand the progress that we're making against the program.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I had one follow-up. Nick, I thought I heard you, mid single digit growth for Technology & Equipment going forward. I just want to make sure that that's your expectation, and is that doable for next year? And what's the path to get there? And what does that assume for CAD\/CAM? Can that actually grow next year?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, so I appreciate the question, Tycho. Yes, indeed we still are projecting mid-single digit growth rate beyond 2018. The valuation reflected a lowering or rebasing of that revenue number given some of the changes that we talked about or impacts in 2018 and a lower margin given some of the impacts as well that we noted on pricing and promotions and other expenses. But from here going forward, we're looking at a mid-single digit growth rate as we said.","And adding to your first question to Don, obviously, there's a lot of cost initiatives and ways that we believe we can reduce costs. But a high priority is continuing to drive revenue. And there's significant investment to do that, given the fixed cost structure of the business, that's the best way to drive improved margins.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the question. Yeah, I guess just wanted to make sure I understood some of the destocking comments, Don, a little bit better. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate on why the dealer inventory, I guess, has turned out to be much higher than the company had thought previously? And I'd be interested in hearing what your impression is kind of looking through the destocking of what the end market demand is?","And if I could just add one on top of that, it sounds like it's occurring at multiple dealers. Just wanted to confirm that this is actually something you're seeing beyond just Patterson.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, first, we are seeing destock \u2013 let's break it down a little bit and answer the second question first. We are seeing destocking in both our major partners. That's the first answer.","And the second, look, on the destocking, first, it's what our dealers are deciding to do. We're working with them. I think we have some circumstances at one of them where they \u2013 a new management team that's come in and assessed where they are from an inventory perspective. And as they look to recast their company \u2013 and again, it's better to ask them \u2013 they want to carry leaner inventories, not just in Technology & Equipment and not just on Dentsply Sirona stuff, but across the board just so they can deal with how they want to project their future going out.","I've had a lot of conversations. Last week, we were able to spend a fair amount of time with both our dealer partners. And the thing that I come away with is in May, we had a lot of conversations with both Schein and Patterson about our commitment to really standing behind the Imaging business and the CAD\/CAM business and why we think they will represent growth engines in the future.","We retooled the plan in the U.S., included adding some clinical reps to help meet demand. If there is a prospect, we want to be able to get out and talk to that doctor immediately. We put in a very aggressive marketing program. We offer some financing that we're starting to see real traction from. I mean, both Stan Bergman and Mark Walchirk were both very complementary of the impact that that program is starting to have.","So again, we're not in control of what the dealers decide they want to stock. We believe that we're starting to see some real traction behind programs we put in place in May and June at the retail level on CAD\/CAM and Imaging. So again, some of this is managing how they want to run their companies. But in my mind I walk away very, very impressed with the commitment that they have to really driving demand for both our CAD\/CAM and Imaging businesses.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No. I appreciate all that, Don. I guess just the follow-up would be, it looks like you're calling for similar destocking in the back half on a 3Q and 4Q basis than what you saw in 2Q. But given the expectation for revenue to be down 2% for the year, it seems like you are implying underlying growth to worsen beyond just the destocking. Could you maybe just spend a little time talking about what the underlying growth assumption is outside of destocking in the back half?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, Bob, it's Nick. So as I laid out, we took about a $250 million reduction in our total revenue, and we note that about $66 million to $76 million of that relates to incremental destocking in the second half. And about $80 million relates to general revenue reductions across the board, mostly in Technology & Equipment.","So it's a combination of both factors. Some softness that we're seeing in our general market for Technology & Equipment, as well as the destocking piece.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, Nick.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Don, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about where you're seeing the increase in competitive pressures? Which categories? And do you need to maybe rethink the pricing paradigm for some of your higher-end systems? Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, let's start with Imaging there. It's really interesting. Coming into the category, you get to learn a lot of things. And I walk away tremendously impressed with our technology.","The thing that we have to recognize, though, is that what we would think of kind of mid-tier kind of 2D and 3D imaging equipment has really gotten a lot more capable over time, field of view and clarity of image and other things.","And where we believe that our highest-end 3D cone beam products are terrific, the functionality of kind of this mid range has really improved to the point where some dentists are willing to sit there and say, hey, I can use this and it costs half as much.","So in my mind, it's really what do we need to be doing to innovate to create a real differential advantage that we can go out and leverage. And right now we don't have that.","So in my mind, the first thing is we got to recognize that the paradigm is shifting and that we need to be competitive in all parts of the marketplace. And we're not today. And that's got to be a combination of innovation. It's got to be a combination of making sure our costs are in line so that if we do have to compete more aggressively on price that we can do it without a serious margin dilution. So that's the first thing in Imaging.","And by the way, this is an effect \u2013 it's different things in different parts of the world, whether it's a unique set of competitors in Asia or whether it's U.S.-based competition, which is slightly different.","The interesting thing in our mind in the CAD\/CAM area, again, if you look back two years or three years ago, we created \u2013 well, actually, we created the category 20 years ago. And we continue to be very optimistic about the role chairside dentistry plays and will play in growth.","And by the way, we're starting to see competition, but again, we feel really good that our chairside system is far and away the best. And we don't anticipate seeing a tremendous amount of pricing pressure that we'd anticipate there.","What we are seeing, though, is the DI category, where you're starting to see a higher prevalence of DI cameras and whether it's competitive cameras or doctors willing to sit there and say, if I'm going to put my toe in the water of digital dentistry and using that, obviously if you move to a simple DI system, that's approximately one-third or even less of what a total chairside system is. So, while we don't necessarily view DI as competitive with chairside, what we are seeing is a rapid expansion of the DI category, which we believe has some impact on the penetration of chairside. Now, ultimately, we believe once dentists begin to walk down the path of DI, they're going to realize that it's a very short walk to being able to do full chairside dentistry and we want to be competitive there. But ultimately, in our mind, it's less a dynamic about pricing on CEREC than it is about how dentists are using different technologies to approach things differently.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. You've outlined some fairly significant adjustments in terms of restructuring, and those don't seem like quick fixes. Do you have a timeline in mind? When do you think you can realign the sales force and at least start to optimize the manufacturing footprint? Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. John, I don't want to get too far out in front of ourselves. Look, we're in the process of making some pretty significant changes in the sales force now, and how quickly and how thoroughly we're able to do that around the globe is work that we're doing right now. In terms of supply chain, we've already taken a couple steps there in terms of bringing in some talent, particularly in the logistic area that is really going to help us do a better job of understanding what that path may look like. But look, in the standard restructuring, this is not something that's going to take multiple years. We want to be \u2013 have a much higher functioning sales force in 2019, and we think we ought to be showing real improvement from an operation and supply chain and kind of the same timing. Now again, we want to start showing improvement. Where we deliver the full benefit of that is obviously going to take some time.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Don, just at a high level, could you sort of talk about the need to have one face with the customer when so much of the business goes through distribution with too many partners? And just remind us today the mix between direct and distribution in the business?","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure. Well, let's start out with there's different models in different places around the world. But let's \u2013 I think your question was a little bit more directed to the U.S. and why we say one face to the customer. In our mind, if we're going to have a resto rep, and we've got a lot of restorative reps that go in and call the doctor, why isn't that restorative rep fully capable of understanding what technology and equipment needs this person may have, what implant systems they may be doing or whether or not that particular dentist is doing endodontic procedures.","And right now, we don't have that capability. Where we have moved to a different model and we've done that right now in the U.K. and France, Australia and in the process of doing that in Germany, where we've kind of moved to the idea that we should have one face to the customer and that one face should clearly be able to call in specialists when they need to. We think that's a far better way of creating demand and representing the full breadth and depth of what Dentsply Sirona is doing. Now, in places where that's going to involve selling an orthodontia and an endo \u2013 some of our endo products or implants, that would run through a direct channel. In the case of, if we do a much better job of building the relationship with a dentist and that manifests itself in improved resto, preventative, or other sales, instrument sales, that'll run through a dealer.","But where it runs through is less material to me than what we've seen in other parts of the world where it's important that a one \u2013 kind of an ambassador, a key account manager has a great relationship with the dentist and is focusing on what problems we can solve for the dentist. And the results we're seeing in countries that have made that shift justify our strong belief that this is a model that should be applied all around the world. And right now, we've done it in four countries, four of our significant countries, and we look forward to pushing that aggressively around the world. But in my mind again, it's important to represent the Dentsply Sirona depth and breadth to that dentist. Where they actually get the products through is less \u2013 is not material to what that relationship needs to look like.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Then a two-part question for Nick. First on the destocking and anything you can share with us in terms of your expectations for the mix of that between the third quarter and the fourth quarter in terms of the $66 million to $76 million that's still left for the back half. And then secondly, you talked about you don't want to bring inventories down further in the year. What are you kind of penciling in for operating cash flow at this point for the year?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, on the first one, Brandon, as I said in the notes, we expected a higher percentage of the destocking will likely occur in Q3. So that'll put a little more margin pressure on Q3 versus Q4. But we fully expect to get through the destocking in this year. On the inventory number, as we said, our inventory had risen during the year. We've put a process in place to reduce that inventory, and we're targeting about $30 million and we expect that in the second half of the year. I don't, off the top of my head, have a cash flow number year-over-year, but we can follow up on that, maybe at the back end of the call.","John Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure. Call you back on that. Yeah.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Don and Nick both, I guess I want to try to reconcile comments that have been made during the call here. Nick, you're talking about mid-single digit growth in technology -- or technologies and, Don, you're kind of talking about maybe what I think needs to happen and you and I have discussed before kind of this move from CAD\/CAM to DI, also talking about maybe some pricing pressure in Imaging and maybe coming out with some lower priced products over time. How do we put 35%, 40% of technologies in those two buckets together with getting back to mid-single digit growth? Is the mid-single digit growth, Nick, more kind of a long-term aspiration? Or do we think we can get there by 2019 even with these two issues potentially having to deal with here in the near term?","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, I would say we don't obviously have a guidance view for 2019, but our expectation is that with the rebasing of the revenue and the dealer destocking that the business will get back to a positive growth rate after the end of this year. But I don't have at this point, Tycho (sic) [Jeff] (44:58), a particular guidance for anything beyond 2018.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Fair enough. And, Don, I guess one follow-up question just on the restructuring and that you're talking about making -- rapidly making some hard choices here in consolidating those 15 selling organizations down to a smaller number than that. You've added a lot of good dental people, but you've also \u2013 a lot of people are gone from Dentsply Sirona here over the past year as well. Where in the organization is there the experience and the depth to kind of guide this big restructuring over the next period of time? Just kind of get us comfortable that the experience and the depth of beyond just you and Nick of the management team is there to really guide such a big process.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. And, Jeff, I think that's a very astute question, and thank you for it. So, look, at this point, there has been a lot of change. And if you look at Nick and I cumulatively here, basically about a year, year plus, that certainly prompts the question. If you look at what we just did, though, and, Jeff, I'm not a 100% sure how familiar you are with some of our management team one level below, with Walter Petersohn we have a 20-year plus vet who's actually served as a CCO before that's got great experience literally all around the world and most recently has been in the U.S. Comes with a deep Technology & Equipment business.","Bill Newell is 13 years plus and has actually worked around the world and spent a fair amount of time in almost every one of our franchises. So we think there is a fair amount of experience there. If you go a step below that, literally all around the world, we actually have some pretty good experience in moving to the one customer base. We talk about France, U.K., Germany, Australia, where we have actually done this. And we have a full packet of this is lessons learned, this is how you do it, this is what to watch out for, this is the systems you have to build. So it's going to be a combination of experience that we have and a process that we can follow and do that.","And then I can tell you we're not shy about bringing in external help. As we have kind of gone through, as we look through the restructuring, we're bringing significant temporary resources on to help us approach that almost as a project. We were creating a PMO, project management organization, that will have separate resources that will help us synchronize all the moves that we need to make. And the very first question that I think Tycho asked that I think is a valid one. How do we make sure as we're going through a relatively significant change, we keep our eye on the customer and we make sure customer service is front and center, and our ability to create demand is front and center.","So we understand it. We believe that we have got a fairly deep bench of a lot of experience around the world that we're calling on. We are blending that with new people. I would like to think that both Nick, myself, we have a new GC -- relatively a new GC and other talent that we're starting to bring in like in the logistic and supply chain area that is going to allow us to blend old and new to create a far more exciting organization.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Hey, Brandon, it's Nick. Just quickly to your question, we are expecting improvement in working capital cash flow in the second half of the year versus last year. I gave you guys the CapEx number both year-to-date and expected for the year, and obviously you've got kind of the view on our targeted operating margin. So hopefully, that backs into the cash flow number for the year. But if you have questions, we can follow up. And then separately, Jeff, I'm sorry I called you Tycho.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I've been called worse. Thanks, Nick.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","All right.","John Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","All right. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So you touched on this a little bit but, I guess, I'm still just curious to get more color on the flow and context of the conversations you're having with the distributors. Are they saying to you, hey, there's minimal demand for your products, I just don't need any more supply? Or is more of the conversation distributors are saying to you maybe, hey, I'm trying to be lean and mean, so I don't want to tie up as much capital on my inventory but the demand for your products is relatively unchanged? Just curious if the conversation skews more towards one side of that versus the other. And also just to kind of throw it out there, I mean, when is the phrase destocking really just code for softer demand for your products in the marketplace? Many people and investors are kind of wondering about that as well. Thanks.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yes, Steve, and I would answer -- it's kind of a two-parter but they're obviously very related. Again, we've spend a fair amount of time with our dealers. We spend a ton of time with them in May basically looking at where we were in the total Equipment business. We put a program into place that our conversations, extensive conversation with both of them last week say you're really starting to see traction. I mean, we spent several hours with at team with Henry Schein, great team. We get along very, very well with them and have very frank conversations. They're quite comfortable. And as a matter of fact, in their call yesterday, they talked about how optimistic they are about the movement they're seeing in Technology & Equipment.","And look, as they came in, they're coming up on a one-year anniversary of taking on our products. I think that they're beginning to sit there and say they have a pretty good understanding of what demand looks like. They are seeing accelerating demand, but they're looking to optimize what their inventory looks like. The same conversations -- again had a great conversation with Mark Walchirk on Friday and just talking about where we are in terms of demand creation. They're feeling very good that they're seeing good traction in the marketplace following the program and it's far more of an inventory optimization in their mind in terms of as a new leadership team comes in there and assesses how can they opt \u2013 after an SAP implementation, how can they optimize their inventory levels. And again, we don't want our dealers with a bloated inventory number.","So, again, in my mind, we have a wholesale issue. There are two separate discussions; a wholesale discussion and a retail discussion. We feel good that we're starting to see better traction, particularly in the critical U.S. market, particularly around CAD\/CAM right now. We're looking forward to good IDS world that comes in the back half of the year. And again, our conversations with both our dealer partners has been very, very positive about the underlying demand. And again, they're optimizing what they want to do from a cash-flow perspective. So, I don't think in either of the cases this is anything more than how they want to operate.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for the time here. I think the questions up to this point are appropriately focused on some important details of the story and some strategic questions. But I think even after all the feedback we got from you guys, it's going to be a little tricky for people to get their head around some of these issues. So I wonder if we could come at the discussion from a couple of different angles.","One is, Don, given your experience looking at distribution businesses and at med tech businesses, I wonder if you've thought about what you're doing at Dentsply Sirona in as much as it might be particularly similar, different to other markets or other companies where you've worked? And if you might be able to think about analogies that could help investors to think about what the path might look like. That's my first question. Then I have one follow-up.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Well, look, I think there's a lot of examples. And as I look at Dentsply Sirona now, I've had a lot of experience at Johnson & Johnson, I've had a lot of experience at Cardinal Health, and I think you pull from there. I also think there's a tremendous number of examples that I've seen in med tech. And let's review two of the highlights that I think. And let's start with demand creation because I think that's really important.","Right now, as you saw in kind of the med supply in the med tech space, as you began to see hospital consolidations, it was no longer in everybody's best interest to try and run 20 different sales forces at a same \u2013 at individual hospitals when all of a sudden there was a GPO. So there was a tremendous amount of how do you begin to shift your selling organizations to recognize economic buyers, as well as like clinically-oriented buyers.","So I think there's ample examples in the med tech space about how you need to evolve your selling organizations to be reflective of changes in the marketplace, point one.","Point two, literally coming out of a distribution company that had a pretty extensive manufacturing footprint, you sit there and you say, boy, having a harmonized supply chain where there is a single point of demand forecasting that then focus into a single logistics chain, that's where you get efficiencies.","And the thing that strikes me here most literally in a very, very vivid way, we have local countries that manage their distribution centers. So in a place like Taiwan, we might have two or three distribution centers. And because you have local ownership, there is no synchronization. So you have manufacturing facilities that are literally trying to forecast to 80 points of distribution, which makes it incredibly hard.","So I think that the synchronization of that, I can take examples from whether it's Cardinal, whether it's J&J. By the way, you can go look all across med tech where there is, how do we get really smart about distribution, which you create regional hubs that serve smaller front kind of forward DCs, and then from a manufacturing standpoint, how do you basically centralize demand forecasting, and then make strategic make versus buy decisions and then rationalize your footprint.","So in terms of the path that what exactly is it going to look like, I think any of these situations are relatively unique. But I would tell you what we're focused on is we have to do two things. First, Nick talked extensively about it. We have a relatively high fixed cost base and that's what we're trying to attack. When we grow, the fixed cost base is not as much of an issue. So we got to get growing.","And right now I think we have failed to optimize the potential of Dentsply Sirona because we're approaching it like 10 different individual units as opposed to how do we recognize there's one dental customer and maybe that dental customer is going to be doing a little bit of implants, a little bit of endodontic procedures. But we at Dentsply Sirona really should be able to come in and help them in their totality. And every day that we're not doing that, I think it's a missed opportunity.","And then from a supply chain perspective, because we do have a high fixed cost base and the high fixed costs are associated, in my opinion, with a relatively individualized supply chain that needs to change. So I think we're going to get after that.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Steve, the only thing I would add is I think we all recognize and, obviously so does Don, is just how uniquely positive some of the dynamics in the dental industry are versus other segments of healthcare, and I think part of our strategies are to drive toward some of those attributes.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah. And just at the total risk of being a corny company CEO, I got to spend a fair amount of time out in the field. And one of our really bright reps down in Galloway, New Jersey, we were calling on one dentist and she was really happy. She was a resto rep and she was really happy, she was seeing one of her biggest dentists.","And literally walk into the dentist and it turns out that he's probably one of our biggest single implant users. He's a big Astra user. And we're sitting out in the car talking about this afterwards and sit there and say, did you know he's a big Astra user? She goes, no, not really. That's not my job. My job is to focus on resto.","Well, we went back in and had a conversation with the doctor. It turns out not only does the doctor \u2013 hadn't connected the fact that his wonderful restoration products were coming from Dentsply Sirona, but the implant products were coming. And he immediately wanted to talk to us now that he recognized it, I want to talk to you about upgrading my imaging program. And then I was able to talk to him right then about CAD\/CAM, because, geez, if we're going to do total restorations, let's do it chairside.","So I think that kind of underlines the potential of what we have. We just have to get after it. And I don't think heretofore we've had the will to do that here at Dentsply Sirona.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Makes a lot of sense. My one follow-up is about capital deployment. I wonder given the confidence in the path on hardware particularly and the new clarity that we have about where we're going on inventory, why we're not hearing a little bit more about share repurchase here. I appreciate that there is an interest in deploying capital to M&A, but this would seem like a historic opportunity to step in and buy the stocks. Can you speak to that point? Thanks.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, Steve, certainly, we've been, I think, relatively consistent, and I think you've seen that we had an authorization of up to $1 billion to buy stock. Our message has been consistent from the beginning in that we will use excess cash flow to buy stock opportunistically in the market, and we hold to that. Our strategy is not any different than it's been over the last six months, nine months.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning. First one, I'm actually going to pivot away from the U.S. for a moment which clearly has a bunch of moving parts. Just on the previous call there you guys alluded to strengthening momentum in both Rest of World and EMEA, yet EMEA which is 40% of revenue took a step back with internal growth down, I think, it was 1.4%. So can you talk about what is going on with EMEA and how you feel about that growth trajectory going forward? And then I've got a quicker follow-up.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Sure, Jonathan. On EMEA, the story is really IDS. I mean, it's the biannual show, and we were up on the comparison year on year with IDS which is what we think the principal thing going there. And it's interesting we just came back from doing kind of a relatively complete regional review. We feel pretty good about most of the trends that we're seeing over there. And Rest of World, again, one of the benefits of coming in with a relatively fresh set of eyes you get to go out and do regional reviews.","Particularly, I was there at the -- they capped off a week where we had an Astra implant summit in Shanghai. We were able to track 1,500 dentists and by the way, it was a standing room-only overflow. And you walk away from looking at the developing markets and the real need starting to see accelerated trends for need for dental care in general and we think we're really, really well positioned for that because we operate at scale in all those countries. So we've said literally, I went back \u2013 we were reviewing scripts for this call, went back to the first call we made a couple months back, and the first thing we said is we expect Rest of the World to grow. We've been out, really met the leadership teams there and more optimistic about that today than I was six months ago.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I still thought EMEA was supposed to sequentially improve throughout the year, but I'll go back and check my notes. But just to shift on, to the point you just made to a previous question, the sales force, can you talk about if sort of this old XRAY and zero (61:04) approach is the right way and then you want or hope that they work with each other and then sync in with the distributors. Or is there a simplified way where sort of one individual wears two hats and they're able to convey that more unified message and get across your broader portfolio to the end customer? Thanks, guys.","Don M. Casey - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, look, again not getting too far ahead of ourselves, but again, we've actually seen this model work in a couple countries. So we're actually taking a playbook that we've developed in good positive markets, U.K., France, we're in the transition in Germany and Australia. And what that model actually looks like is kind of a key account manager or ambassador that goes in that can basically talk about most of the procedures where we have major products, and then when needed, they call in specialists.","So if you're \u2013 the example of the dentist I was talking about that is really thinking about upgrading their Technology & Equipment, well, we can bring in a Technology & Equipment rep and really explain the benefits of what that looks like. So it's an ambassador model, a key account model with -- supplemented by specialists and we believe that that has shown real traction in markets outside the U.S. By the way, we think we can do it in other large markets. We can do it in China, Japan. We can do it in the U.S., Canada and other places. So again, it's a model that we do have a playbook. I think the model looks like focusing on the individual dentist, knowing a ton more about that individual dentist, and making sure that we're there to provide solutions for them, because we really have a very, very broad portfolio.","John Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Final question, I think.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. In terms of the incremental destocking anticipated for this year, where does that leave you now in terms of distributor inventory level relative to what you had experienced, I guess, historically? Is there some conservatism embedded in those destocked target? And then also going back, I think it was Brandon's question earlier, do you anticipate any sort of fundamental change in the role of third party distribution for you? And can you remind us your commitment there to the third party distributor? Thanks.","Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.","Yeah, Erin, it's Nick. Thanks for the question. On the second one, very quickly, as Don said, we are committed to our distributor relationships. We think they work. Obviously, there's been some reordering with the 2017 change in distribution agreements in the U.S. but a lot of dialogue is going to get us to the right place. So there's no expected change there and we certainly think that that's the right way to be.","On the first point, we don't have a particular view on the month's inventory by our dealers. We just feel that they have taken the step to reduce it for their own optimization of their balance sheet and we chose to accept that and we've changed our outlook for the year to reflect that. I think it's probably going to be the right level and theoretically their own logistics systems will provide for them to be able to fulfill product as it's demanded but I can't pass judgment on what the right levels are for them. It's just what was communicated to us late last month or earlier last month and we have reflected in our outlook.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Don M.

Just as a reminder, today's presentation is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Derek Leckow","Thank you very much, Vicky, and my thanks to each of you for joining us this morning to discuss DENSPLY International's first quarter 2012 results. Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO, Chris Clark, President and COO, and Bill Jellison, Senior Vice President and CFO. We'll have some prepared remarks this morning and then we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have.","I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is also available for downloading on our website, www.dentsply.com. We have also provided a set of supplemental slides that is available for download as well.","Before we get started, it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","As you can see in the release, our results this quarter include a number of non-recurring items and other non-GAAP adjustments. In an effort to provide you clarity from the distortion of some of these items, our comments on this call will focus on results including certain adjustments which are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You'll note that our earnings guidance is also on an adjusted basis.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret Wise","Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. We're very pleased to report record sales and adjusted earnings for the first quarter 2012 this morning. Overall, I think its fair to say that the global dental markets are stable and growing. Certainly, the markets are strong in U.S. benefitting from a now expanding economy, some job growth and pent-up demand for dental procedures.","In Europe the markets continue about at the pace that we saw in the fourth quarter last year. Slow growth in the north and recessionary conditions in the south, but, overall, I'd say the European dental markets continue to show some modest growth.","With this backdrop we're pleased to report what we view as a pretty strong results for Q1. Let me give you a few highlights to start, then Chris is going to cover the Astra Tech integration and speak to our opportunity in emerging markets. And, then, finally, Bill will provide some more details on the financial performance.","So, as noted in the release, sales as reported were $716 million, that's up 25.6% and, excluding precious metal content, sales were up 26.3%. Both were records for the first quarter driven primarily by our 2011 acquisitions, most notably Astra Tech, but reflecting continued improvement in internal growth, building off what was a strong finish we had in fourth quarter 2011.","At a high level internal growth continues to be driven by a wave of new products we launched in 2011 and some additional momentum we're picking up now from 2012 launches, as well. Our growth, excluding precious metals, for the quarter breaks down as follows:  Total growth, as I mentioned, was 26.3% as comprised of internal growth of 1.1%, acquisition growth of 27.2% to result in constant currency growth of 28.3% and a negative currency translation of 2.0%.","Internal growth at 1.1% was, again, negatively impacted by the natural disaster last March in Japan, specifically, causing supply outage in orthodontics. Excluding Japan and orthodontics, internal growth for the quarter was 4.5%. That\u2019s the best we\u2019ve seen since pre-recession and its coming up against a reasonably strong 3.8% internal growth in last year\u2019s base line.","Geographic internal growth, and I\u2019ll give you this first in total and then without orthodontics in Japan. So, first, in total, internal growth XPM, including ortho and Japan, was a positive 3.5% in the U.S., again, that despite the headwinds we faced in orthodontics. There\u2019s a negative 1.1% in Europe and a positive 1.3% for rest of world. ","Now, again, those same statistics without ortho and Japan, which is probably a better measurement for us at this point, internal growth XPM was a positive 7.4% in the U.S. That\u2019s a continuation, essentially, of what we reported in the fourth quarter last year. Internal growth in Europe, ex-ortho, was a positive 2.2% and that\u2019s slightly below what we had in the fourth quarter, but we think still well above what the market is growing in Europe. And, rest of world, ex-ortho and Japan, was a positive 4.4%.","On geographic growth, again, this is ex-ortho and Japan, in the U.S. we saw very strong results, essentially, across all business categories. So, ex-ortho, all categories, including specialty consumables and lab, reported mid to high single-digit growth and in some categories double-digit growth.","New products launched, both last year and early this year, continue to drive very high customer acceptance and are driving growth well above market. Likewise in Europe our internal growth of 2.2% is likely well above the market and, again, is driven by new innovation. While we\u2019re very pleased with this performance relative to the market, I think it\u2019s fair to say we remain cautious on the European economy and the European market given the uncertainty in that region. In rest of world we were up 4.4%, which is an improvement from what we had in the fourth quarter, but we see some upsides from here moving forward.","As far as product categories are concerned, our internal growth, ex-ortho and Japan, was mid single digits, this is global now, and specialty and consumables in low single digits in prosthetics. The trends were generally the same we saw in the fourth quarter except for prosthetics, which is now showing positive growth even with the drag of the alloy market which is converting away from precious metals. And, as you know, we have a large market share in that market.","In implants, looking at our combined business on a pro forma basis as if we had owned Astra Tech for the first quarter last year also, our internal growth was mid single digits, actually, it\u2019s probably fair to say towards the low end of mid single digits. Although this was a bit weaker than we saw in the fourth, our growth in the U.S. was very strong, double digits, and in Europe it was barely negative, less than 1%.","Our rest of world continues to show positive growth overall with some ups and some downs by countries or regions.","On earnings, and Bill will have more details on this in a moment, we were pleased to see that adjusted gross margins expanded nicely this quarter, driven by acquisitions, but also by the price increases we implemented late last year. Our expenses were also up and as we expected, because Astra Tech had a much higher expense ratio than the base DENTSPLY business. So as we merge that into the results, of course we're getting a natural inflation of that expense ratio, and that ratio is also, of course, affected by the cost we're incurring to sustain the orthodontics business, anticipating a re-launch mid this year. So obviously we expect that to improve moving forward.","As noted, the orthodontics supply situation continues to create operating margin pressure for us. However, we've now anniverasaried the initial supply shortage, and therefore we believe now that the worst of the year-over-year comparisons are behind us. For the first quarter this depressed earnings between $0.04 and $0.05 per share. In the second quarter this should diminish and then it should turn positive beginning in the third quarter. Our supplier has made substantial progress in expanding capacity, and we continue to expect a re-launch of that line mid-year. I think it's important to emphasize that although we are expecting sequential improvement in this business, we do view this as a multi-year rebuilding process for the business.","On Astra Tech just a few comments. We're now launching the integration and have gone live in North America with one combined entity and sales force. Christ will comment further on this first stage integration, but from a high level it's going very well. We're also moving forward with our integration strategy outside North America. However, timing of that strategy will vary by country or region. Overall, the integration is on track and in line with, or in some cases, ahead of our expectations.","One last point is that we're very excited about a global event taking place next week in Sweden. Astra Tech is hosting a symposium for approximately 2,500 customers in Gothenburg. This is an event that's held every three to four years, so it's really a great opportunity to introduce our new organization to our customers and also demonstrate what we can accomplish together. ","Our earnings performance, non-GAAP came in at $0.52 per share. That's up 4% from the prior year quarter. This, of course, reflects the negative $0.04 to $0.05 year-over-year negative comparison for orthodontics. If orthodontics had been neutral, year-over-year adjusted earnings gain would've been in the low to mid-teens. ","Looking forward, remain confident with our earlier guidance of 222 to 230 adjusted earnings per share. I'd say our confidence has increased by our first quarter results in both sales and earnings. Our increase in confidence in the orthodontics recovery plan, continued strong results from the acquisition and integration, but it's tempered somewhat as we stay vigilant on the outlook for Europe and currency movements. ","On the quarterly progression of earnings, Q2 will still have some lingering downside year-over-year in ortho, which we expect to turn positive year-over-year later in the year, beginning in the third quarter, and we'll still see some negative currency headwinds in Q2. ","That's my prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris. He's going to comment on the Astra Tech integration and also our opportunities in emerging markets. Chris.","Christopher Clark","Thank you, Bret, and good morning everyone. I'm going to take a few moments and provide some deeper insights into our investments and activities in emerging market regions, which have really been key growth drivers for us over the past several years. I'll then also provide a brief update on the integration efforts relative to the Astra Tech, which at a high level continue to go very much in line with what we expected. With respect to emerging markets, these regions have been an area focus for us for the past several years, and continue to be central to our strategies in 2012. While the demographics of these regions, these markets are certainly attractive with the rapidly growing middle class populations. We also believe that as a result of our strategies and investments made, our market share position has gradually improved in aggregate of these regions over time. As a group, these regions continue to be accretive to our overall growth rate. Our sales to emerging markets as a percentage of our overall global sales, excluding acquisition impact, has increased by over 400 basis points over the past five years. As a percentage of global sales, emerging markets now represent a mid to high-teen component of our overall sales mix. Based on the demographics and the fact that we have continued to invest disproportionately in these markets, we believe these regions will continue to be accretive to our growth rate for the next decade or more. A core strategy for us in these markets continues to be expanding our sales force footprint to reach more customers. This has been a concerted investment area for us, as our aggregate sales force in these countries has increased by over 50% over the past five years. We now have country organizations in 25 emerging market countries, with DENTSPLY sales representation in an additional 20 countries beyond that. We are implementing plans to further expand our sales organizations in several key emerging markets by an additional 15% this year. In addition to expanding our sales force footprint, we've also expanded our investments in the areas of sales training, both in terms of selling skills and product training, and our approach in these emerging markets really allows us to heavily leverage the infrastructure and experience that exists in our franchise organizations. Another increasingly important strategy for us in emerging markets is the development of dual branding approaches. The use of dual brands allow us to approach these markets with alternative brands compared to the premium brands we utilize in developed markets, and then we can position these brands more appropriately for the specific economic or market conditions that we face locally. We continue to expand the use of our Sultan and Zhermack platforms in this manner ensure side consumable products. We've also recently launched several value brands in the endodontic franchise. We're now expanding these brands geographically to additional emerging market countries as registrations are completed. We view dual branding as a core long-term growth strategy for us in these markets, and are continuing to expand our internal resourcing to support these efforts. The final strategy that has been a component of our growth in these markets has been business development activities, as we have found acquisitions to be an effective approach to gain critical mass and experienced in-market resources in specific emerging market countries. Over the last six years we've completed six transactions in emerging markets, including both manufacturers as well as sales and marketing companies. These transactions have been core to our strategic approach in these markets, as they've expanded our presence and capabilities in several key emerging countries, and in some cases are providing platforms to expand beyond individual markets to provide for a broader reach across emerging market regions. We're pleased with the attraction each of these strategies or approaches are having in the emerging market regions, and based on the success in these markets and the strong demographics, we anticipate continuing to invest disproportionally in these regions and deriving growth rates that are continuing to be accretive to our overall growth.","I'd now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts. As Bret mentioned, we're excited to have completed the launch of our combined DENTSPLY implants organization in North America. We're pleased with the reaction to the combined business from our internal organization as well as from our customers, and feedback has been quite positive as they are quickly seeing the strength of our combined portfolio of implant solutions. The sales team is energized on this new portfolio and the new opportunities it provides our customers, including, for instance, last week's launch of the expanded Atlantis customized abutment platform to now include our U.S. ANKYLOS customers.","The integration beyond North America is also continuing to go as expected and we continue to be very pleased with the level of collaboration within our teams, the excitement within the business, and our sales force retention levels. In addition to our strategy of creating a combined dense volume implants organization, we are also moving ahead with our strategy to create a dedicated healthcare business that provides specific focus on the growth opportunities in chronic urology consumables. We anticipate announcing a new name for the global healthcare business shortly and are moving forward with the global structure necessary to provide the focus and support needed to realize the significant opportunities that we see in this business. I look forward to providing additional updates on our integration efforts during future quarterly calls.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail. Bill?","William Jellison","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Bret commented on our sales growth, but I'd like to add just a couple of additional comments regarding our sales. The 2012 first quarter geographic mix of sales without precious metal content was as follows:  U.S. represented 34% of our sales, Europe was 46% this year and the rest of the world was 20% of sales. The strengthening of the dollar compared to the first quarter of last year negatively impacted our top line growth by 2 percentage points in the quarter, however, FX had only a minor negative impact on earnings per share compared to last year in the quarter, in part due to our hedging strategies. We continue to expect about a 2% to 3% headwind from current foreign exchange rates on both top and bottom line this year with the largest negative impact of approximately 4% to 5% occurring the second quarter.","As Derek mentioned, and as you can see in our earnings release, the first quarter included a number of items which impacted our results. By excluding these items from our quarterly results, we believe the adjusted figures provide a more comparable picture of the company's overall performance. Most of the following comments exclude the impacts of those items.","Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales, ex-precious metals content, in the first quarter of 2012 was 59.5% compared to 57.2% for the first quarter of 2011. When compared to the same period last year, this rate was positively impacted by favorable product mix and price increases. Our product mix continued to be benefited by the strong gross margin rates of our recent acquisitions and from strong sales of endodontic and general consumable products. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of negative exchange rates, mostly caused by some key products that are purchased or produced in Switzerland and Japan.Our recent acquisitions are expected to have a positive mix impact on gross profit margin rate comparisons over each of the next two quarters as they are fully reflected in the Company's results. SG&A on an adjusted basis was $283.7 million or 42.6% of sales, ex-precious metals in the first quarter of 2012 versus 38% in the prior year's first quarter. As we have mentioned, our SG&A rates are expected to run higher for two reasons. First, our recent acquisitions have higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales then our base business and thus we are, as we bring those into our mix, they will increase this ratio but will be mitigated somewhat as we complete our integration efforts over the next few years. Second, although our orthodontic business sales are down substantially due to the lack of complete supply of product, we are maintaining the infrastructure of this business in anticipation of a full re-launch of these products.This year-over-year comparison, with a higher expense level as a percentage of sales, will continue through the third quarter of this year when the acquisition impacts analyze and the orthodontic business begins to show year-over-year improvements. We do, however, expect to show some sequential improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales in the second quarter and we also expect both a sequential and a year-over-year improvement by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year.Operating margins based on sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis were 16.9% in the first quarter compared to 19.3% last year in the same period. Also you should be aware that as a result of the Astra Tech acquisition, that supply has recently made some changes in our senior management assignments and as a result we have realigned our segments in this quarter. When we file the 10-Q in the next day or so, you will see that the segments have changed and that we have restated prior years to reflect the new structure as required by the accounting rules.As Brett noted, the Japanese natural disaster negatively impacted our earnings per share this quarter by approximately $0.04 to $0.05, mostly from the loss of sales in our orthodontics business from the lack of consistent product supply. While the supply situation is improving, we expect this business will have a negative impact on results in the second quarter of 2012 of approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share measured on a year-over-year basis.Net interest and other expense in the first quarter on a reported basis was $13.9 million compared to $4.5 million in the first quarter last year. This increase and expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech.Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 20.1%, however, there are tax adjustments reflected in that rate. On an adjusted our operating tax rate for this quarter was approximately 23%. The tax rate continues to be benefited from a more favorable geographic mix. We are also benefiting from permanently reinvesting international income as we are able to more efficiently utilize those earnings. We believe that a tax rate of approximately 23% is reasonable when looking at 2012 despite the higher tax rate of our recent acquisitions.To better understand and follow some of the following comments, you can look at the tables included in our recent press release, which reconciles performance from US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP performance.Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the first quarter of 2012 on an as reported basis was $53.3 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared to $69.1 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011. As mentioned previously, these results include a number of items mostly associated with recent acquisitions which are detailed in the press release issued this morning.On an adjusted basis, earnings excluding restructuring, acquisition related costs and other related items and tax adjustments in both periods, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, were $75.3 million or $0.53 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $72.1 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011. But remember that this quarter includes a negative $0.04 to $0.05 per share negative impact from our ortho and Japanese businesses.Cash flow from operating activities from 2012 was approximately $20 million compared to $45 million in the first quarter last year. Inventories were increased in the first quarter to support the rebuilding of inventory for our orthodontic relaunch planned for mid-year and to support inventory levels during out integration activities. Cash flow was also negatively impacted by the timing of some tax payments during this year.Capital expenditures were $19 million in the quarter with depreciation and amortization of approximately $36 million. We do expect capital spending will increase some as we move through the year to support volume increases as well as some opportunities supporting the recent acquisitions.Inventory days were 110 as of the end of the first quarter of 2012 compared to 106 days at the end of the first quarter last year. These levels now also reflect the addition of the Astra Tech inventory. Accounts receivable days were 58 days at the end of the first quarter of 2012 compared to 60 days at the end of the first quarter last year. At the end of the quarter of 2012, we had $67 million in cash and short term investments and total debt was $1.77 billion at the end of the quarter.","In 2012 we have repurchased approximately $36 million of stock or approximately 0.9 million shares at an average price of $39.00. Based on the Company's authorization to main up to 34 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 13 million shares available for repurchase. However, as we have now competed, in our recent acquisitions, our preference will be working to pay some of this new debt down before we would utilize the remaining authorization, although we will more than likely continue to offset options.","As mentioned before, recent acquisitions have increased the volatility that changes and effects rates we have on our sales and earnings as more of our sales and production is now located outside of the U.S. We are most impacted on sales by changes in Euro and our purchases and cost structure are most impacted by the Euro, Swiss Franc, Swedish Krona and Japanese Yen.  We are utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions to help minimize the volatility that these effects fluctuations may otherwise have on our business. At current exchange rates we expect to have a negative impact from foreign exchange rates in 2012 on both sales and EPS. Finally, as Bret stated, we are re-affirming our 2012 earnings-per-share guidance at $2.22 to $2.30 per share on an adjusted basis.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The Question-and-Answer session will be conducted electronically today. (Operator instructions)  We'll take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Thanks and good morning. I just had a couple of follow-up questions from your prepared remarks. Bret, just to follow up on the ortho division, I think when the tsunami hit just a little bit over a year ago, ortho was about 9% of the revenues for the Company, if I'm not mistaking. Would you be able to give us that number today?  What I'm trying to figure out is that I understand that the comps are going to start to ease in the back half of the year, but I'm trying to figure out what you are expecting in terms of revenue growth year-over-year or revenue contribution from that ortho business? Or, does the EPS impact ease just because we anniverasaried the event?","Bret Wise","Okay, well, thanks, Glen, and there are a couple ways to get at that question. First of all, Orthodontics was more than 9% of our revenue. But we have a global orthodontics business. The amount of product coming from this one supplier, in this one plant, was the 9% you're thinking of. So 9% of our global sales came from that one facility which eventually we lost supply from for an extended period of time here. I don't want to get too specific, but you should assume that our sales of those specific supplies were cut in half or something like that. As we re-launch these products mid-year, we're going to see some earnings improvements, one, because we've anniverasaried the event, so the earnings downside from last year is now the baseline, but, second of all, because we're re-launching the product line and we'll begin to grow again.","So, that's the guidance we have for you at this time. We may be able to give you more specifics going forward, but I do think that as we anniversary this and move through the rest of the year, we're committed to providing you sales with and without orthodontics for the rest of this year. So, you know at least what that impact is on internal growth, and you don't have to guess.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the implant business. If I heard you correctly, Bret, you seemed to suggest that the implant business maybe grew low-to-mid singles. It sounded like 3% to 4% this quarter. That was down maybe a percent or two from the most recent quarter. Is that a fair assessment?","Bret Wise","Yeah. We grew mid-single digits organically, or what we call internal growth of the combined business, kind of towards the low end of mid single digits. That's slightly weaker than what we had in the fourth quarter for that combined business, although markets are different in the fourth quarter than first quarter, so I'm not sure I'd pay a whole lot of attention to that.","I do think it's fair to say though because now all five of the premium implant companies have reported and based on those numbers we believe the markets probably flat to maybe slightly down or maybe slightly up, but certainly a mid single-digit number is well above the market at this point.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. That's fair. And, Bill, maybe if I could just follow-up on one comment you made. You said you expect about a 4% to 5% currency impact in 2Q. Should we assume that the Company's kind of adequately hedged so that won't have a big impact on earnings in 2Q or is that not correct?","William Jellison","No, I mean, I think if you look at our general overview on FX impacts as we've got in our broader-based presentations that we show, generally right now we look at the top line impact, whatever that may be, impacting the bottom line by anywhere from about half to that full sales level impact. So it depends on the currencies, which currencies are changing and how that's making the mix up within our sales side. While we do have some hedging activities in place, it's there to mute that impact, to help it so that it doesn't have a greater impact than it does on the sales, but it doesn't eliminate it. This last quarter it did just because of the nature of when the hedges came into play, but, in general, you should expect that those should go more in tandem.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate that.","Bret Wise","Glen, I'd add to that that Q2 is the quarter where we have the greatest headwind this year, because the Euro was much stronger in Q2 last year. The full impact of currency is reflected in our guidance for the year.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next we'll hear from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair","All right. Thanks very much. Just a quick follow-up on your ortho line. Are you launching your full product line at the AAO show this week?","William Jellison","No. We won't have the inventory in place and sufficient supply to do a full launch yet. We're aiming for mid year on a full relaunch. We'll, of course, be at the AAO meeting. We'll be showing product and talking to customers and so forth. We do have some supply so we're still supplying customers at some level, but the full launch won't occur until mid-year.","John Kreger - William Blair","Okay, great, thanks. And just broadly, I think you mentioned you were seeing the benefit of some price increases. Can you just update us about what those price increases have been for you and are you seeing any competitive price pressure, perhaps in Europe at this point?","William Jellison","I think in general, and we've pretty consistently stated what our pricing objectives really are, I'd say even over the last five years that we've generally tried to target something in the 1% to 2% on average. I'd say this year continues to probably be at the upper end of that range, kind of in the 1.5% to 2% range and I'd say that we've got many lines that might be well above those numbers but average across the whole product line, portfolio, the company and geographic mixes, that's more consistent. ","I'd say moving forward, we'd expect that we would also be targeting for price increases of that nature and probably higher this year, especially as it relates to helping to offset some of the net tax that's going to be effecting 2013. We'll give you more updates on that as we move through this year.","John Kreger - William Blair","Thanks, Bill. Any commentary on competitive pricing changes? Do you see anything unusual there?","Bret Wise","This is Bret. Not really. We've had a really broad portfolio here so there's always pockets, this product and this region where you'll see some price pressure, a customer discounting or perhaps a customer doing bundling deals, excuse me, a competitor doing bundling deals. I would not say those dynamics are any different than we would normally see. ","John Kreger - William Blair","Great, thanks. And then one last question. I know you've benefited from the new product flow last year and it sounds like this year too. Can you just talk a little bit more broadly about your R&D spending and investment strategy is? Should we think about that generally trending as a percentage of revenue so it would grow with your top line?","William Jellison","It does grow with our top line and it's been growing. We've been investing more in R&D. Generally speaking, R&D runs, and this has two components, but it runs about 4.5% of sales, 3% or so goes through the traditional R&D spend and STNA line and then there's about another point and a half external R&D that ends up getting funded through royalty streams that goes through cost of sales. So that's generally been consistent over time although we've been increasing it, particularly in the last two or three years and we've been seeing a strong return from these new product innovations we have.","John Kreger - William Blair","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","Thanks, Bret, Chris and Bill. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. First on implants, can you remind us what percentage roughly of current sales of the combined businesses now is Europe and what percentage is the U.S.?","William Jellison","Just implants?","Bret Wise","Just implants.","William Jellison","Just implants. Yeah, of just implants I'd say that the total for Europe is probably in the 65 percentage kind of range for Europe.","Bret Wise","It's about 60%.","William Jellison","Yeah, keep in mind that Astra Tech's business was a little bit, obviously, much more balanced between the U.S. and Europe, where ours was Europe and international and very little here in the U.S. So we're still more heavily weighted to the European market, which, as Bret mentioned, is the market that was actually declining in the period. So if anything relative to some of the other players, we would actually have more of a negative mix in our implant business than some of them. So I think our performance overall was very solid in the quarter.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","Right, I see. So it seems like the message is in Europe you subtract, add market to maybe slightly better in U.S. continuing to do quite well. But you said one of your first priorities as you roll out this combined business is to protect sales under Jim's leadership, and I think, Chris, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're pleased so far with retention of the sales force. So, I guess, when do you feel comfortable where you can breathe easier on retention? Is that another three to five months we watch for? And just how important is the show next weekend in Sweden given that it's held only once every three or four years?","Bret Wise","Okay. Thanks, Larry, there are a couple questions there. Let me just make one comment. On Europe, our implant sales in Europe is the best number we've seen out of all the competitors so far. So we were slightly down, but we've seen other competitors really down much more than we were, and we were kind of a red zero in Europe this quarter. I'm going to let Chris talk about the retention issue further.","Christopher Clark","Sure. Larry, what I base it within the retention aspect is that the integration is really an ongoing process and will be an ongoing process for many months, certainly through the end of this year. The U.S. integration obviously moved faster for a number of reasons, and we're obviously very pleased with how that went. I would say that due to the integration in other countries it's going to phase out or phase in basically between now and the end of the year, in some cases maybe even early next year.","The preparation efforts and the discussions and the collaborations I think we're very, very pleased with. I would say certainly the moods of the sales organizations at this point are very positive, because they see the power of the two portfolios coming together and the opportunities that, that creates for them, as well as for customers. But obviously one of our key assets through this is the sales force, and we're certainly going to stay close to that and make sure we do whatever we need to do to retain them as we move through the transitions. But, overall, we'll pleased.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","Yeah. Thanks. I think the second question, I guess maybe a quick collaboration, and you mentioned also, Chris, on the new branding of the catheter a business, again remind us kind of how, you may have mentioned the prepared remarks growth you're seeing there, I know you've always said, 'Hey, we're excited about our management team,' you're actually separating them out to give them more fire power, so a little bit of elaboration on the branding and then how do you think that's going to translate into potential sales opportunity here in the next 6 to 12 months?","Bret Wise","Okay. Larry, this is Bret, I'm going to comment on the growth and I'm going to let Chris speak to the branding issue. That business is doing very well; we're seeing very strong growth in the U.S. although U.S. is a smaller component of that business but very, very impressive growth in the U.S. in that business. Europe is slower growth of course, I think for obvious reasons but overall we're very pleased with the performance we've seen from that business so far and more importantly perhaps the R&D pipeline we see in that business right now, and, Chris, you want to speak to the branding issue?","Christopher Clark","Yes, in terms of the branding, we cannot use the Astra Tech name moving forward after a certain point but frankly we view that as an opportunity really to create a new brand and a global brand for the health care business. I think our organization is very excited about that concept and again we're just, we're pretty close to finalizing that and being able to launch that and I think you'll see some exciting sizzle behind that as we do that and again I would just say, it just adds to the comp combined with Bret's comments in terms of kind the blatant business opportunities we see in this business.","It just kind of adds to the overall excitement we're seeing in the number of opportunities so we're pleased with it.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","OK. Great, two other quick ones, one is you mentioned cash flow from ops dragged down a little bit versus last year because of extra inventory's, both with the orthodontic restocking and then a new opportunities, I guess, with implants, as you look at the actually inventory number though, is it sort of half and half impacted both by that and I guess, just remind us, it seems like historically you guys have been able to generate about 80% of your reported EBTDA comes from cash flow from operations, as a combined company now with Astra Tech is there any reason that would be much different going forward without trying to get your guide to specific cash flow number?","Bret Wise","No, I think that that's a reasonable estimate for you on the cash flow side. We would expect again another very strong year on cash flow this year. Our first quarter is typically a lower period for us in general but as I mentioned, you not only have some of the inventory sides and I think that yes you can think of those as a little bit split between those two areas but we also have some acquisitions related costs that are dragging on the cash flow here initially in this period as well, so between that and some of the tax charges we'd expect as we move into the second quarter and also through the rest of this year that we should continue to have very strong cash flows.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","And final thing, your proxy came out here as of last week and I noticed that clearly management got, hit their bonus targets a little bit better because of the strong internal growth, you were able to show like 3 \u00bd% reflected in that. It's a first time in a couple of years, I think, you've been able to do that and I know you're excited about that so I guess it's fair to say it seems like every indication, I guess for you Bret, is it your goal is to try to that and better in terms of internal growth this year. So is that a fair statement, and it seems like where you sit now you feel pretty comfortable, you're going to be able to hit those targets again this year?","Bret Wise","Well, I don't want to get into the specific targets, but I think it's fair to say at the beginning of the year we try to set stretch targets for the management team, both for internal sales growth and for net income. Last year we did pretty well against those targets and you should expect as we setup 2012 we likewise have stretch targets. I think we're off to a pretty good start here at 4.5%, but to hit our targets we have to perform very well throughout the whole year.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","Okay. Very good. Thanks.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Brett and Chris, a couple questions for you and then maybe just a follow-up modeling question for Bill. Brett, on Europe I hear your comments on maybe staying cautious here at this point and visibility not being great, but you also came up against your toughest comp IDS. Last year was a very strong meeting for you guys and most of those benefits flowed into your Q1 last year. So how do you see the next few quarters playing out? Should we really be thinking about that falling off or is there potential that you could hold in at kind of plus 2% or so range?","Bret Wise","Thanks, Jeff. I think that there's more uncertainty and more difficulty projecting how Europe's going to develop this year than any other region in the world. We read the newspapers, we see some pretty dire projections. We haven't seen those affect dimple, though, to that large degree that it's affecting some other industries. I think people have to continue to get their dentistry done, and that seems to be holding true.","Also, I think that the market is vibricating. The north is still growing for sure and the south is certainly contracting or in recession, so there are almost two Europes we have to deal with now throughout. I think that we're comfortable in saying now, though, that what we said at the beginning of the year, that we believe the European dental market in total will be positive this year, will grow to some degree. If that's true, we think we can grow above market.","It's just a little bit difficult to be very specific. Now, the point that you raised is a good one. And that is Q1 last year was very strong in Europe. We did have a tough comp. It was an IDS year. So I think that 2.2% growth we put down in the first quarter is a pretty strong performance.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","All right. Thanks. Then, Chris, just your comments on emerging markets was very helpful on the revenue side there. I'd be interested, though, what that translates to for current EBIT margins and you think those EBIT margins progress. Do you need to be adding significantly more infrastructure over the near and longer term given the duel branding strategies and those kinds of things?","Christopher Clark","Yeah, Jeff. Obviously we're happy with the growth there, but we're also happy with the profitability. I think I would say they're certainly profitable in terms of our businesses in emerging markets, but they are also slightly dilutive on a fully loaded cost basis versus our businesses in developed countries. That's largely due to the pricing of those countries, obviously, due to some of the underlying economic market conditions in those countries.","That said, we also carry lower SG&A as most of our R&D and certainly a good deal of our global marketing support is in developed rather than emerging markets. So, I would say, again, it's something that our profitability continues to improve. It's something that on a variable cost basis, as we get more volume in through our plants that are buying large in developed markets, as a result of emerging market growth, that also significantly improves that profitability moving forward. So, again, it's profitable. A little bit dilutive today, but we're continuing to make progress on it. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. BairdAll right. Great. Then, Bill left two questions for you. Just, on the operating margins side, sequentially the traction was left this quarter, which is a good sign. But if you break out Astra Tech, if you break out orthodontics, could you give us any kind of apples to apples what operating margins for the company would have done, ex those issues? Number two, on the gating of EPS, sounds like the orthodontic headwind will come down by about $0.03 or so this quarter, but the FX impact to bottom-line probably going to be $0.02 or $0.03 higher as well. So I'm assuming Q2 should look similar to Q1 as far as year-over-year changes on EPS, and then the rest of the growth comes from the back half? William Jellison Just a couple of comments on that, Jeff. First off, as we talked about before, we aren't breaking down any of the different components of the business just so that we aren't identifying different profitability levels of different areas. So, as we move forward, you're looking at kind of the overall broader-based business, and that's how we're generally talking about it. As far as the second quarter is concerned, you're right in the fact that the ortho side is going to be a little bit less with that period. As I mentioned, it's only probably a $0.01 to $0.02 drag within that quarter, instead of the $0.04 to $0.05. So, that will be nice to see, and hopefully as we get into the back of the year then see some sequential and year-over-year improvements on that. On the FX side, I'd say that your FX bottom-line impact is probably a little bit too high of a negative impact. It's probably more in the range of maybe a penny or two, but it's hopefully not more than that, unless FX rates are really a lot worse. I'd say that our bottom-line in the quarter is probably going to be a little bit less of an impact on the top-line, but generally they're relatively close to each other. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. BairdAll right. Thanks guys. Bret WiseThank you. OperatorNext we'll hear from Jonathan Block with SunTrust. Jonathan Block - SunTrustThanks guys, and good morning. Bret WiseGood morning. Jonathan Block - SunTrustMaybe just a follow-up on the orthodontics business. It seems like the impact in the quarter was largely as expected, and also for the guide for Q2, but can you speak a little bit about the back half of the year and do you still expect ortho to sort of be net neutral for full year 2012? Then, just from an execution standpoint, when you look at your supplier, do you feel like most of the risk, the execution risk, is now behind you and it's just sort of a question of how the inventory ramps back up going forward? Thanks. Christopher ClarkOK. Well just to answer the first part of that question, on the overall impact at this point, we still are expecting that ortho is going to be more neutral for the year. Maybe just a slight positive, but probably not much. I'd say that that's still a big hurdle for us to overcome in the back half of the year. We're going to be down four to five in the first Q, down another one to two in the second quarter. So, we do have to see some nice improvements. As we talked about, as well, that's a multi-year kind of recovery in that business. But as far as how that goes, maybe Bret can comment a little bit more on that.","Bret Wise","Yeah, Jonathan, on the supplier, they've made just heroic progress here. I mean, from losing their plant entirely to starting a new facility, etc., and really they've done a fabulous job and they're improving sequentially. You know, we do have good weeks and bad weeks, but, overall, if you track the line that there's a pretty steady improvement.","We do think we're going to be able to re-launch this mid-year, and we think that it will continue to grow. Of course, we don't need quite the capacity we had before the crisis  today, because we're not going to have all those customers back immediately. But we do think we'll have sufficient supply to do the launch mid-year. I think it's also fair to say that we're taking nothing for granted, right. We're following the situation very closely. We've got contingency plans, etc. But at this point, at least, the prospects look good for us in the back half of the year.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust","Okay. Great. And then considering the U.S. market it was another really strong quarter and I think ex-ortho, you gave another 7 plus number on the growth rate. Can you speak a little bit just to the dynamics on the U.S. market, I mean, was it very similar to the December quarter. Can you call in any difference in discretionary spend coming back a little bit?  Anything that you can call out in the change of the dynamics that Q-over-Q.  ","Bret Wise","Well, the only dynamics, I mean, the growth rates were almost identical, right. It was 7.5 in the fourth quarter and 7.4 in the first quarter. So, it's essentially identical. The one dynamic that did change a little bit was our lab business picked up and grew really quite strongly in the first quarter. And although it did grow in the U.S. in the fourth quarter as well, it was stronger in the first quarter. So that's a good, I think, indicator for the heavier dentistry, the more expensive dentistry, because that's what those products go into.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust","Okay. The last one is just a housekeeping item. Just on the restructuring charge. Can you just detail, is that from the Ortho business or can you give us some detail around that?","Bret Wise","No, I mean, the restructuring end, you'll probably see a little bit as we move through this year. But you'll see different restructuring pieces as it ties in mostly to our integration related activities and we aren't expecting large amounts. But I think that over the next few quarters you may see a million or two in each of the different quarters.","Christopher Clark","This is a consequence of combining locations, etcetera.","Bret Wise","Right.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust","Understood. Thanks guys.","Bret Wise","Okay.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks, good morning.","Christopher Clark","Hey, good morning.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","One housekeeping question. Sorry if I missed this, but Bill, could you give us the number of selling days in the quarter and how that compared to last year.","William Jellison","The selling days were exactly the same year-over-year.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks. And then on the U.S. consumables trend inter-quarter, and this really applies to the lab comments you guys were making, is it fair to say that U.S. strength that you've seen over the last two quarters is holding up and you would say that the U.S. is in a sustainable recovery? I mean, not looking for any chronic quantification here. I guess another way to ask the question is, do think there's been any evidence in the U.S. that people are looking to do some catch-up or are we on new trend?","Bret Wise","Well, coming out of recession we usually do see pent up demand in dentistry. A lot of dentistry can be deferred, so as people get their jobs back we usually trend up above the economy for some period of time as we get that dentistry that's been deferred through the pipeline. I think when you look at our performance, the mid-sevens, that's way above market and it's probably, I mean, I don't think that's the long-term trend rate growth for the market.","As far as the market itself goes, we'll know a lot more when we see the distributors' report. The data points we have now are three or four manufacturers that have reported and the results right now are pretty inconsistent among those four. I think when we see the two distributors' report in the next few weeks we'll know about the actual growth rate of the market right now.","This is a market that shouldn't vary a lot from period to period, so I would expect, unless there's some dramatic change of events in the world that we'll see, we should see, the recovery here kind of continue and remain reasonably around what we've seen for the last few quarters. We're talking about the future, here, so it's yet to be seen. There's lots of uncertainty and risks, but I don't see great variances moving forward from here.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","And following up on your comments on the distribution channel. Have you guys seen any variability quarter-to-quarter in the levels of inventory in the distribution channel?","Bret Wise","Well, we do see levels change, but that's mostly tied to our price increases. When we do a price increase, we see the level of inventory go up in the channel and we usually see it come out in the next channel. Absent that, and this can be company specific, too, because they could be running promotions or whatever, but absent that we haven't seen a lot of variance in our numbers.","Christopher Clark","Just to further comment on that, I think that we generally try to state during these calls, as well, if there's any significant movement in the dealer-inventory channels in the periods. Last quarter we actually said that despite the 3.9%, - last quarter meaning 2011's fourth quarter, we said about 3.9% and we said actually there was some dealer pullout during that period. I'd said generally our inventory levels with dealers are at very good levels at this stage during the first quarter. We didn't really see much movement at all in that, so we think the numbers that we recorded are pretty much corresponding to even an adjusted number there.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thanks everyone. ","Operator","Next we'll hear from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Riddell Walker - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. This is Riddell Walker in for Bob Jones today. I just had a quick question about the implant business. Can you talk about any market share shifts that you guys have seen within the market between your new integrated business and some of the more established players? Thanks.","Christopher Clark","Riddell, that's a really tough question to answer because we think we're obviously gaining market share, but who you're taking market share from varies by customer, by dentist. It's hard to talk about trends other than just looking at internal growth for the five companies and seeing who's trending up or who's trending down versus the average. At this point, I think we continue to take market share in that market although it's difficult for me to say who exactly it is coming from.","Riddell Walker - Goldman Sachs","OK, great, thank you.","Bret Wise","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Yi-Dan Wang from Deutsche Bank.","Yi-Dan Want - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much. I have a few questions. First of all, on your implant business, certainly great out-performance, you might say. Can you give us a sense of how sustainable this is? This has been going on for quite some time, obviously, very impressive, so if you could comment on that.","And, then, secondly, also on implants, can you give us a sense of your growth in price and volume terms. I just want to understand how well you guys are able to hold your prices. The third question is on the subject of inter-oral scanners. How important do you think this technology is to DENTSPLY, maybe not immediately, but over the next three to five years and where DENTSPLY is with this technology. Thank you.","Bret Wise","Starting out with the implant market share gains, as you mentioned, that's been going on for some time, both Astra Tech and DENTSPLY have a pretty well established, well researched, lots of clinical data on our systems. In DENTSPLY\u2019s case we got two systems, we've got 25 years of data on one and I think 12 years or 10 years on the other, and Astra Tech has about 25 years of clinical data on theirs. So these are proven systems. I think that marketing is responsible.","As you mentioned, we have been taking share. It's hard to say how sustainable it is, I hope it's sustainable and I don't see any evidence that it's not at this point. Number two on growth and is it price driven or volume driven I'd say price is largely neutral. I'm gonna ask Chris if he has anything else on that, but from my perspective it would be primarily volume. Is there any?","Christopher Clark","Were getting a bit of price. I would say the growth we're seeing is probably a little bit more volume than price but it certainly includes price as well. ","Bret Wise","A little positive price?","Christopher Clark","Yes, correct.","Bret Wise","OK, and in oral scanners, I think it is important to dentistry. The scanner itself will eventually become a bit of a commodity. What's important is what you do with the digital data that comes out of the scanner, whether you have an open system or a closed system. It is an important technology for the global dental market, I think you should expect a dense ply will be involved in some fashion. ","Yi-Dan Want - Deutsche Bank","Thanks very much.","Bret Wise","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Brandon Couillard from Jeffries.","Brandon Couillard - Jeffries","Hi, good morning.","Bret Wise","Good morning.","Christopher Clark","Good morning.","William Jellison","Goof morning.","Brandon Couillard - Jeffries","Bill, a bit surprised to see this year we purchased activity here in the quarter. Do you have a goal in terms of the net leverage ratio you'd like to be at by the end of the year or do you have more flexibility under those credits agreements. And then were there any other acquisitions in that M&A figure in the quarter outside of Astra Tech?","William Jellison","From our perspective, from a repurchase, we've stated before that if we did repurchase at this point over the next few years, it would primarily be just tied into off setting option levels. Our target level was pretty much right in the range that we actually ended up doing. From an overall leverage perspective for the end of the year, I mean, we still expect to generate a lot of cash, obviously, this year and our main focus is absolutely on repaying debt. But I think that as select acquisition opportunities come along, too, especially small- or mid-sized tuck ins, that we'd at least be willing to take a look at those.","But we do expect to make some improvement on our leverage ratios as we move through this year and I think that as you look at the acquisition breakdown, yeah, the majority of that was Astra Tech. There was a little bit out there for some smaller acquisitions, but most of it was Astra Tech related.","Bret Wise","Yes. We haven't completed any acquisitions since the Astra Tech acquisition, at this point.","William Jellison","Correct. No additional ones then.","Brandon Couillard - Jeffries","Okay. That's helpful. Should we expect the inventory to continue to build until after the second quarter, once you formally re-launch the ortho line and then wind down sort of from there into 2013? Is that how we should thinking about the working capital side?","William Jellison","No. I'd probably say that our expectation is that our inventory levels are at pretty good levels at this point. We'd expect some improvement, hopefully, already in the second quarter of this year. The third quarter, generally, it doesn't improve, and if anything it may actually even creep up a little bit. Generally our second quarter and our fourth quarter are periods that we bring down, especially in the fourth quarter. We would hope to over the next one to two quarters bring down some inventory off of current levels.","Brandon Couillard - Jeffries","Thanks. The last one is for either Bret or Chris. It seems like a number of competitors seem to be stepping up their presence in the customized implant abutment arena. What's your view of the competitive landscape there and the outlook? If I could get maybe just a comment on your sense of the low-end generic implant market environment and whether there have been any changes that you could speak to in the last several months.","Christopher Clark","Yeah, Brandon. It's Chris. Glad to take that one. First from a customized abutment standpoint, we're really happy. Obviously, it is an attractive market. Certainly, Atlantis has kind of created that market and certainly captures a very strong share and, I think, with that captures a fair amount of attention from other folks. I would say we're very pleased with the competitiveness of the Atlantis offering, and certainly the ability to bring our portfolios together, the combined sales organization to help push that through.","Certainly there's competition, but I would say the total package, in terms of what we can offer at this stage of the game, we're pretty happy in terms of how that differentiates. I would say the same thing relative to economy implants. The fact is, there's a lot more to it than just the manufacturing of an implant, and certainly the clinical support that all three of our product lines have, I think, is a pretty strong differentiator relative to those types of competitors. So we view differentiation as pretty critical, but we also are pretty pleased in terms of what we have at this point in time to differentiate with.","Brandon Couillard - Jeffries","Great. Thank you.","Bret Wise","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll take a follow-up from Larry Marsh.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","Oh, thanks. Just a quick one for Bill. You mentioned a new structure and the restatement in the Q, I mean, can you as sense a magnitude, how big of a restatement that's going to be?","William Jellison","No that's only related to the segment so its just a mix of the segment makeup themselves because different managers are responsible for different portions of the business.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","Just reallocation of the business is right. That's right. You had talked about that.  ","William  Jellison","Yeah, we'll still have four segments. It's just that they'll be shown slightly differently than they were before and as soon as you get the Q if you've got any questions on any of those feel free to give me a call.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","And are you going to give us a restatement on that going backwards?","William Jellison","Yeah, for any period that we show those segments at, any comparable period, will also be shown in that same format.","Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital","Yeah, okay. Very good. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take a follow-up from Jeff Johnson.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. Hey, Bill, just one last modeling question here on the equity and the affiliate\u2019s line much lower than we thought this quarter. One, is that  DIO bond reevaluation. Two, I think you exclude  DIO bond reevaluation then from the $0.52 EPS number. And, three, just any updates on the Korean dental implant market which seems to be influx right now just how you're thinking about  DIO going forward.","William Jellison","Yeah that's correct, Jeff. And there's a line item. That's one of the adjustment line items to get to our non-GAAP numbers, as well. There's about $4.7 million at net that we took a negative hit for within this quarter in the income statement and that is only to reflect our portion of their negative impact from marking up the convertible bond on their side. That's solely related to the increase in the stock price of their stock. As their stock price goes up, that makes our convertible bond, in essence, more expensive to them, but obviously more favorable to us.","So while we take a negative impact there, there's a much larger and an offsetting positive that we're running through, but we run that through our OCI. It doesn't go directly through our P&L until the point in time that we convert. If we select to convert that bond in the future, if there's an amount out there that previously had gone through OCI, that would also then run through our P&L. If we had converted, let's say in this period, we'd have had about a $23 million positive net income impact in this period, which we would have also identified then as obviously an non-GAAP adjustment.","So anytime that that stock price goes up we're going to take a negative hit on our P&L until the point in time that we convert if we do convert that. Again, anytime you see that in our income statement where we haven't converted, there's a much larger amount in the opposite direction that we're also putting into our equity.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. Yeah, the Korean dental implant market?","Christopher Clark","Yeah, Jeff, it's Chris. I mean I would say overall relative to the comment to DIO. We're really happy in terms of their growth platform. We're seeing solid growth. We believe they're taking market share. Certainly their growth, if we were to consolidate, would be a accretive to our overall growth rate. We see a strong management team there.","And, again, if relative back to the emerging market comments, this is a platform that is doing a pretty solid job in expanding into some other emerging market countries. So, overall, we're pretty pleased with what we see there.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. I'll turn things back over to you, Mr. Leckow, for any additional or closing remarks.","Derek Leckow","Well, thank you, Vicky. Thanks, everyone. Good questions. So, if there\u2019s any follow- up questions, please contact investor relations. That concludes our conference call today. Thank you for your interest in DENTSPLY. Goodbye.","Operator","And that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for joining.  "],"6893":["Dentsply International Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President, Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, sir.","Derek Leckow","Thanks very much, Audra, and my thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss Dentsply International\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2011 Results.  Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and COO; and Bill Jellison, Senior Vice President and CFO.  Each of us will have some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll be glad to answer any questions that you may have.","I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning.  A copy of the press release is also available for downloading on our website, www.dentsply.com.  We have also provided a set of supplemental slides that is available for download as well.","Before we get started, it\u2019s important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.  These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.  A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.","As you can see in the release, our results this quarter include a number of non-recurring items and other non-GAAP adjustments.  In an effort to provide clarity from the distortion of some of these items, our comments on this call will focus on results including certain adjustments which are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release.  You\u2019ll note that our earnings guidance is also on an adjusted basis.","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise.  Bret?","Bret Wise","Thank you, Derek, and good morning everyone.  Thank you for joining us here on our year-end call.  We\u2019re very pleased this morning to report record sales and adjusted earnings for 2011.  I think as we look back on 2011, there were four major themes for us.  When we entered the year, 2011 was very much a story about new product introductions and innovation, and on that level we performed very well \u2013 in fact above our expectations, particularly in endodontics, preventatives and restoratives.  ","On March 11, of course, we were faced with another situation with the crisis in Japan and a loss of supply to about 9% of our business.  We\u2019ve managed through that this year, facing the supply shortage essentially throughout the year, and we\u2019re hoping to get back to full supply by midyear this year.","The third item, of course, was the opportunity to acquire Astra Tech, which we viewed as a significant opportunity to grow our business.  Astra Tech added over $150 million in sales for the quarter and over $200 million in sales for the four months under our ownership.  We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of both the implant and the healthcare businesses for this early period of our ownership and have great expectations for this transaction.","The fourth theme, of course, was economic activity where we saw a gradual strengthening in the U.S. economy and frankly the U.S. dental market throughout the year, and we saw a sequential weakening of the European economy throughout the year which culminated in a contraction for that economy in the fourth quarter.","With this backdrop, we\u2019re very pleased to report that sales for the full year were 2.54 billion.  That\u2019s an increase of 14.3% for the full year, including precious metals, and 14.8% excluding precious metal content.  ","From a market perspective overall, we\u2019re very encouraged by the progression of the dental market in the fourth quarter and our own sales growth.  In total for the quarter, sales grew 29.9% with metal and 30.0% excluding precious metal content.  The growth number ex-PM breaks down with internal growth in total declining 1.2%, acquisitions added 30.4%, and translation was a positive 0.8%.  Internal growth, excluding orthodontics in Japan, was a positive 3.9%.  That\u2019s consistent with the trend that we saw all year.  In fact, our internal growth for the full year, excluding orthodontics in Japan, was also 3.9%.","Geographic internal growth \u2013 and I\u2019ll give this first to you in total with orthodontics in Japan, and then subsequently without those two factors.  So first in total, growth ex-PM was a positive 0.7 in the U.S. \u2013 this is internal growth \u2013 0.7 in the U.S.  It was negative 1.9% for Europe and it was negative 2.2% for the rest of the world.  Of course, orthodontics in Japan are significantly influencing these results, so without orthodontics in Japan, internal growth ex-PM was a positive 7.6% in the U.S., which is a material improvement compared to really any measure that we\u2019ve seen in the last five years.  Internal growth in Europe ex-ortho was a positive 2.8%.  That\u2019s not bad considering the environment in Europe.  Rest of the world was a positive 1.0%.","On geographic growth, in the U.S. we saw really strong growth across all of our business units, essentially all the business units except of course orthodontics, improving sequentially and year-over-year.  Although these results are strong and our data suggests that the retail sales of our products were at least in line with this growth, and perhaps were stronger because we think we probably reduced dealer inventories modestly during the quarter.  Our new products continue to gain traction and are driving growth well above market in the United States now, and we expect that to continue as we move into 2012.","Europe\u2019s internal growth, again, was 2.8% excluding orthodontics, and that was driven by new product introductions, and we\u2019re also very pleased with this performance although I\u2019d say we continue to be concerned about the market in Europe and the economic and the political uncertainty in that region.  All that said, our results continue to be positive, driven again by new product innovations and growth well above the market in Europe.","Rest of the world, we had a mixed bag with very strong growth in many of the developing regions; however, that was offset by two regions where we reduced promotional activities, increased prices and reduced dealer inventories.  On a consumption basis or a retail basis, we\u2019re probably mid-single digit growth in the rest of the world in total, with emerging market growth high single digits and the developed markets lower.  I think from your perspective, I\u2019d probably take our rest of world results for the last two quarters and average them and think that\u2019s a more reflective number for us.","Just to frame up the year, growth for the full 12 months ex-PM was a positive internal growth of 0.4.  Acquisition growth was 10.8 and translation was positive 3.6.  For the full year, internal growth ex-ortho in Japan again was positive 3.9, and we think that\u2019s well above what the global dental consumable market is growing.","Overall I think our results reflect a global dental market that continues to expand but is driven today by the U.S. and emerging markets, whereas a year ago it was Europe and the emerging markets.  By category \u2013 again, this is ex-ortho in Japan \u2013 both consumables and our specialties were up mid-single digits while lab was just barely negative \u2013 I\u2019d say a red zero.  Lab without the contraction in the metal market was positive.  That\u2019s the second quarter in a row for that, and it was much stronger this quarter than last, so sequential improvement there.","One other data point here is dental implants.  Our total portfolio of dental implants \u2013 this includes Astra Tech on an organic basis \u2013 had pro forma organic growth in the mid-single digits.  It was stronger in the U.S., as you might expect, and weaker in Europe.  Of course, the Astra Tech growth is reported as acquisition rather than internal growth.  Also, our healthcare business grew organically mid-single digits, but again this is included in the acquisition growth rather than internal growth.","On earnings, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here this quarter so Bill is going to provide more details.  Overall, EPS non-GAAP came in at $0.51 for the quarter and $2.03 for the year.  For the quarter, orthodontics continued to be a drag on earnings in the $0.05 to $0.06 per share range, and that\u2019s generally in line with our expectations we had coming into the quarter.  For modeling purposes, this will continue to be a negative year-over-year basis for the next two quarters, more so in the first quarter than in the second, but should turn positive in the back half of 2012; and for the full year, we think it will be neutral to slightly positive on our earnings on a year-over-year comparison.","Our supplier continues to gradually improve production levels, although a bit slower than we had anticipated when we gave our last update.  We\u2019re pleased to see the sequential improvement in supply levels, but we\u2019re still far below the pre-crisis capacities of production.  Lastly, we\u2019re getting more visibility into the capacity schedule now and feel that we\u2019ll be able to do the full re-launch of this product line midyear.  ","Currency was an increasing headwind sequentially during the quarter, with the euro in particular weakening significantly \u2013 it was down about 5% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  Although still slightly positive, currency in total was slightly for our top line in Q4; it was slightly negative on the bottom line, and Bill will provide more discussion of the currency impacts in his comments.","So let\u2019s move on now to 2012.  Overall for the year, we\u2019re anticipating a continued gradual recovery in the U.S. market.  For Europe, we\u2019re modeling a market that can stay slightly positive despite the negative economic headwinds faced in the region.  Based on these assumptions and continued strong performance of our new product portfolio, we\u2019re estimating that non-GAAP EPS will grow to the range of $2.22 to $2.30 for full-year 2012.  This of course reflects continued integration of Astra Tech, a slight year-over-year earnings improvement in orthodontics, organic growth in our other legacy Dentsply businesses, and some headwind from currency.","As far as Astra Tech, we expect some continued integration charges in the first quarter and maybe the second, but going forward the earnings statement is going to be much cleaner and easier to follow than it was here in the fourth quarter.","As far as quarterly progression on earnings, it\u2019s important to remember that the orthodontics headwind will be the strongest in the first half \u2013 in fact, strongest in the first quarter, and currency is also a headwind for the first half of the year at current exchange rates. ","So in closing my remarks, overall 2011 was a busy year for us with many challenges but also several important opportunities.  Overall we\u2019re pleased with the results and we look forward to continued growth in 2012.","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark who\u2019s going to discuss our new product performance and a brief update on the Astra Tech integration.  Chris?","Christopher Clark","Thank you, Bret, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019m going to take a few moments and provide some deeper insights into the impact of our innovation efforts this past year, and also an update on our integration efforts relative to Astra Tech.  As we\u2019ve mentioned on previous calls, innovation has been a key driver of our results in 2011, and it remains a critical growth strategy for us.  I\u2019d like to briefly highlight some of the most impactful new products that helped drive our growth this past year and provide a few insights into our strong continuing innovation pipeline moving forward.","On the material side consumables area, we had several new products in 2011 that gained solid market share and should continue to drive growth in 2012 and beyond.  As you may recall, early in the year we introduced ChemFil Rock Advanced Glass Ionomer Restorative in both the U.S. and in Europe with its superior mechanical properties and simplified placement process.  This was our first entry into an estimated $100 million global category and it has already reached a number 4 market position in the U.S., and we are approaching double-digit market share in Germany.  We continue to see strong sequential growth and we expect that to continue in 2012.","Mid-year, we introduced the Palodent Plus Matrix System to the U.S. market, and in the first six months we already represent about a quarter of the U.S. market.  This product is now being expanded to European markets utilizing the same launch plan that has been so successful in the U.S.  Later in the year, we launched the RDH Freedom handpiece, which is a lightweight cordless prophy handpiece that delivers clear ergonomic benefits for the hygienist.  In the first two months since introduction, sales have far exceeded our expectations and it\u2019s clear that this will be a key growth engine for our preventive business in 2012.","Before leaving the consumables area, I\u2019d like to briefly mention SureFil SDR flowable composite.  While this product was introduced in late 2009, I think it\u2019s a really good example of how we use additional marketing, key opinion leader support, clinical studies and product add-ons to help our innovation efforts drive significant growth for several years after introduction.  With respect to SureFil SDR Flow, these efforts enabled us to achieve a 38% growth in the U.S. last year off of an already very strong sales base.","Perhaps our strongest innovation impact in 2011, however, was in the endodontics franchise.  The introduction of the Wave One and Reciproc reciprocating platforms was likely our largest and most impactful new product introduction in years.  These products have received numerous innovation awards around the globe and have clearly driven strong incremental market share gains in the endodontics area.  We\u2019re very pleased with the rates that we\u2019re seeing in trial, repurchase, and cannibalization, and we estimate that we\u2019ve trained over 35,000 dentists on the system thus far.","We\u2019re also very pleased with the market acceptance of the Guttacore obturation system and the early success of the QMix 2in1 irrigating solution.  Together with the reciprocating platform, these products are defining the next generation of endodontic therapy.  ","Perhaps most importantly, we\u2019re continuing to leverage the innovation pipeline as we enter 2012.  This year, we\u2019ve already launched several new products including Volo Disinfectant Wipes from Sultan, which provides us an entry into a $40 million category that we\u2019ve not previously competed in.  We\u2019ve also launched the Vortex Blue nickel titanium endodontic file in the U.S.  This file provides greater resistance to cyclical fatigue, increased torque strength, and reduced shape memory.  Next week, we will be launching the Cavitron Evolution ultrasonic scaling system.  This system includes a patented touch-and-go foot pedal that provides much broader freedom of movement for the hygienist during the scaling procedure.  We will be featuring these products, as well as several other innovations, at next week\u2019s Chicago Mid-Winter Dental Show.","I\u2019d now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts, and I would characterize the integration as moving forward very much as expected.  Our integration strategy includes the creation of a new combined global implant business named Dentsply Implants that combines the strengths of the Friadent and Astra Tech organizations.  This new entity will focus on growing all of the combined brands of the Friadent and Astra Tech portfolios, including XiVE, Ankylos, OsseoSpeed, Atlantis, and Isis.  We\u2019re tremendously excited about the combination of these brands and the organizations and the critical mass that this provides us in the implant market.","Our second core integration strategy is to create a dedicated healthcare business that provides a specific focus on the growth opportunities in that platform.  We continue to be very impressed with the market position Astra Tech created with the LoFric platform and believe the business will further benefit from the additional attention and focus that a separate healthcare organization will provide.  ","Finally, we\u2019ve announced the top level leadership of these organizations, both of which will be under the executive responsibility of Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President.  The leadership team is a true blending of the top talent from both the Dentsply and Astra Tech organizations and will provide strong organizational foundations for these businesses.  Beyond the top level of management, we have a number of integration teams that are focused on specific functional or geographic opportunities.  We remain very pleased with the level of collaboration and cooperation within these teams and with the progress they\u2019re making.  I look forward to providing additional updates on our integration efforts on future quarterly calls.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter and for the year in greater detail.  Bill?","","William Jellison","Good morning everyone.  Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter and the year, but I\u2019d like to add a couple of additional comments regarding our sales.  The 2011 geographic mix of sales without precious metal content was as follows:  the U.S. represents 34% of sales, Europe was 43% this year, and the rest of the world was 23%.  Our sales mix will shift a few points more once Astra Tech is included for the entire 12-month period as its sales are more heavily weighted in Europe.","Despite the recent strengthening of the dollar within the quarter, we will still benefit from a slightly weaker dollar year-over-year, which benefited our top line growth by about 0.8% in the quarter and 3.6% on a full-year basis.  FX had a slight negative impact on earnings per share compared to last year in the quarter, a negative impact sequentially versus the third quarter, and we were favorably impacted overall for the year.  We expect a headwind from current foreign exchange rates on both the top line and the bottom line, with the largest impact in the first half of the year.  For the full year at today\u2019s exchange rate, the top line would be impacted by as much as 3 to 4 percentage points negatively.","As Derek mentioned and as you can see in our earnings release, the fourth quarter as well as the full year included a number of items which impacted our results, which we have indentified as non-recurring adjustments.  Most of the following comments exclude the impact of those items.  Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the fourth quarter of 2011 were 56.5% compared to 55.6% for the fourth quarter of 2010.  When compared to the same period of last year, this rate was positively impacted by favorable product mix and price increases.  Our produce mix was benefited by the strong gross margin rates of our recent acquisitions and from strong sales of endodontic and general consumable products.  These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of negative exchange rate impacts, mostly caused by some key products that are purchased or produced in Switzerland and Japan.  This impact is more easily understood when you look at the 18 to 20% strengthening of the Swiss franc to the dollar earlier in the year, and even the roughly 10% strengthening of the Swiss franc to the euro in mid-2011.","The impact of these higher exchange rates was in our inventory coming into the quarter and came through the income statement in the fourth quarter, despite the weakening of these currencies during the quarter.  In the aggregate, currency rates hurt non-GAAP EPS by about a couple of cents in the period.  Our recent acquisitions are expected to have a positive mix impact on gross profit margin rates over each of the next three quarters as they are fully reflected in the Company\u2019s results.  ","SG&A included approximately $18 million of acquisition and integration expenses and other adjustments.  Absent these costs, SG&A on an adjusted basis would have been $274 million or 40.5% excluding precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2011, versus 35.6% in the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.  As we mentioned on our third quarter call, our SG&A is expected to run higher for two reasons:  first, our recent acquisitions have much higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales than our base business, and thus we bring those into the mix.  They will increase this ratio but will be mitigated somewhat as we complete integration over the next few years.  Second, although our orthodontic business sales are down substantially due to the supply outage, we are maintaining the infrastructure of this business, anticipating resupply and the re-launch of the product line.  This year-over-year comparison with higher expense level as a percentage of sales will continue through the third quarter of this year, when the acquisition impacts annualize and the orthodontic business supply disruption begin to show year-over-year improvements.","Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 16% in the fourth quarter compared to 20% last year in the same period.  As Bret noted, the Japanese natural disaster negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.05 to $0.06 in the fourth quarter, mostly from lost sales in our orthodontic business from the lack of consistent product supply.  While the supply situation is gradually improving, we expect this business will have a negative impact on results in the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $0.05, and a more modest but still negative impact in the second quarter measured on a year-over-year basis as the disaster occurred late in the first quarter and had little impact on our business in that period.","Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was $14.6 million compared to $4.8 million last year in the fourth quarter.  This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech.  ","Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter of 19.7% is not really meaningful as there are tax adjustments and non-GAAP impacts reflected in that rate.  On an adjusted basis, our operating tax rate for this quarter was approximately 22% and ended the year slightly below 23%.  The tax rate continues to have a slightly favorable impact compared to last year and is the result of two items:  first, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix as our U.S.-based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products.  We expect this impact will gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years.  We are also benefiting from permanently reinvesting international income as we are able to more efficiently utilize those earnings.  We believe that a tax rate of approximately 23% is reasonable when looking at 2012 despite the higher tax rate of the Astra Tech business.","To better understand and follow some of the following comments, you can look at the tables included in our recent press release which reconciles performance from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to adjusted non-GAAP performance.  Net income attributable to Dentsply International in the fourth quarter of 2011 on a reported basis was $40.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to $67.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010.  These results include a number of non-GAAP items mostly associated with recent acquisitions.  ","On an adjusted basis, earnings excluding restructuring, acquisition-related costs, and other related items and tax adjustments in both periods, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, were $72.6 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $75.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Remember, though, that this quarter includes a negative $0.05 to $0.06 per share negative impact from our ortho and Japanese business.","Net income attributable to Dentsply International in 2011 for the full year was $205 million or $1.70 per diluted share.  Net income for 2010 was $265.7 million or $1.82 per diluted share; and net income for comparability analysis on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the reconciling items in the press release for the years ending 2011 and 2010, were $290.9 million and $283.9 million respectively.   This represents earnings of $2.03 per diluted share for 2011 compared to $1.94 in 2010, which was an increase of 4.6% for the year.  ","Cash flow from operating activities in 2011 was approximately $393 million compared to $377 million in 2010.  Keep in mind we had a number of payments this year for costs associated with acquisitions, legal settlements and other items of approximately $4 million which negatively impacted operating cash flows for the period.","Capital expenditures were $71 million in the year with depreciation and amortization of approximately 93 million.  Capital expenditures in 2012 are expected to be approximately 100 to $120 million.  Inventory days were 93 at the end of 2011.  Most of this benefit was from currency compared to 103 days at the end of 2010.  These levels now also reflect the addition of Astra Tech inventory as well.  Accounts receivable days were 52 days including similar days for Astra Tech at the end of 2011 compared to 55 days at the end of 2010.  ","At the end of 2011, we had $77 million in cash and short-term investments.  Total debt was $1.77 billion at the end of 2011 with net debt at the time of our acquisition of Astra Tech of $1.8 billion, and has been reduced to $1.69 billion by the end of the year.  ","In 2011, we repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36 per share, and based on the Company\u2019s authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 12 million shares available for repurchase.  However, as we have now completed our acquisition of Astra Tech, our preference will be working to pay some of that debt down before we utilize the remaining authorization, although we will more than likely continue to offset options.","We expect the reasonably stable global economy in 2012 should allow the dental market to once again show modest growth for the year.  As mentioned before, the acquisition of Astra Tech does increase the volatility that changes in FX rates have on our sales and earnings as more of our sales and production is now located outside of the U.S.  We are most impacted on sales by changes in the euro and our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the euro, Swiss franc, Swedish kroner, and also the Japanese yen.  We are utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business.  At current exchange rates, we expect to have a negative impact from foreign exchange rates in 2012 on both our top and our bottom line.","Finally as Bret stated, despite the softness and uncertainty that still plague the broader global economy, we are establishing our 2012 diluted earnings per share guidance at $2.22 to $2.30 per share on an adjusted basis.","That concludes our prepared remarks.  Thanks for your support, and we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  To ask a question today, please press star, one on your telephone keypad.  If you\u2019re using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment.  Again if you do have a question, please press star, one.","We\u2019ll go first to Jeff Johnson at Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thank you.  Good morning guys.  Bret, I was hoping I could start with you, just on the U.S. organic growth number.  Obviously a strong number there at 7.6%.  As I look at how the year progressed, you kind of started in line to slightly below market early in the year; obviously in the second half, you\u2019ve been 100, maybe 300 basis points above market.  How do you feel like 2012 is going to play out?  If the market does X, would you expect Dentsply to be X-plus-100 to 200 basis, kind of where you\u2019ve been the second half of 2011?","","Bret Wise","Well I think, Jeff, our performance in the U.S. market this year was really stellar, particularly at the end of the year.  You might recall that coming into the year we were talking about new product launches, we had this full pipeline coming.  Those started to launch in the first quarter but some of them didn\u2019t launch until the third or fourth quarter; in fact, the endodontics portfolio that we had one file in the U.S. didn\u2019t launch until late third quarter, and thus that momentum has been building throughout the year.  The benefit of new product launches is really a three, four-year period, and so we\u2019re just now in the first year of what could be a good tailwind for us on the new products.  So we expect that to contribute again to above-market growth in 2012.  I\u2019m a little reluctant to say exactly how much above market because there\u2019s a lot of variables to measure there, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re highly confident and we can grow above the consumable market in 2012 in the U.S.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","All right, that\u2019s helpful.  And then on your orthodontics comments, I\u2019ll have to go back and look at how you phrased it last quarter.  My sense is maybe just a little push-out on the timeline, or maybe not feeling as confident you\u2019ll get the full product pipeline back as soon as maybe you were thinking.  Any comments there?","Bret Wise","Yeah, I think that we were a little bit more optimistic coming into the fourth quarter than we are right now.  The progress made during the fourth quarter at the supplier and the ramp-up of the production was not what we had expected.  We\u2019re still expecting full launch by mid-year this year; I think before we were probably saying sometime in the second quarter.  We\u2019re still confident about the recovery plan but the ramp-up wasn\u2019t quite as fast as we thought it would be.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Is there anything you can share that\u2019s maybe creating some headwind there and gives us comfort that this won\u2019t then get pushed third quarter or fourth quarter, something like that?","Bret Wise","Well, our supplier is very optimistic and continues to give us capacity schedules which we think would be great if they hit them, but they may be optimistic in some ways.  So I think we\u2019re taking a bit more conservative stance now in their ability to get back to\u2014the timing to get back to a full 5,000 SKU assortment of products.  At this point, we don\u2019t think that it will slip further than we\u2019re giving you guidance on now.  We think this is a mid-year full re-launch, both in the U.S. and Europe, and we\u2019re just going to have to update you on that as we go through the year.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Fair enough.  Last question for Bill \u2013 I\u2019ll jump after that.  Pretty aggressive deleveraging already off the deal at $100 million-plus.  Should we think of that and just kind of double that for 2012?  Is it 200, $300 million deleveraging expected in 2012, or how to think about that, Bill?","William Jellison","Yeah, I\u2019d say that that\u2019s a reasonable expectation.  We utilized pretty much all of our free cash flow in deleveraging that, so you know how much operating cash flow that we generate.  We\u2019re expecting to probably generate similar levels, obviously, again in 2012, so unless we\u2019re putting any money back into some additional small or mid-sized acquisitions, you should expect us to be paying down at that kind of level.  ","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And it\u2019s the lower interest rate debt that gets paid off first, right \u2013 that 1, 2% debt, if I remember right?","William Jellison","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","All right.  Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Larry Marsh at Barclays Capital.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks and good morning.  Just a couple of things, if I could \u2013 first, as Chris talked a little about the introduction of products and sort of how it was disproportionately beneficial in the fourth quarter, but as you said, your fourth quarter internal growth U.S. is best since\u2014looks like as we look at it since mid-\u201905.  So as we think about this year for the U.S., does that mean the comps for the first half of the year should be particularly good and then slow down a little bit as you get toward the end of 2012, or as you look at it with product introductions, your confidence level with U.S. growth being certainly above market, better than it would have been three to four months ago?","Bret Wise","I think our confidence is better than it was three to four months ago, and Chris may have something to add to this; but the uptake on these new products has been really encouraging.  It\u2019s true we\u2019re going to have easier comps early in the year in the U.S. than we\u2019ll have in the fourth quarter \u2013 7.6 is a pretty high number to overcome.  But I think for the full-year, when we look at longer periods of time for full-year, we feel really good about our prospects in this market and the benefit we have from this new innovation.  ","Christopher Clark","Yeah, the only thing I\u2019d add, Larry, is I feel like we\u2019ve got a pretty solid head of momentum at this point on some of those new products, and I would expect that to continue obviously early in the year, and we\u2019ll just keep driving it and keep it going.","Bret Wise","Yeah.  The other thing I\u2019d add to that is that the pipeline for this year is pretty good as well.  We\u2019re going to have another slew of new products to hit the market this year and we should get the uptake from those, as well as the carry-over uptake from the ones we launched this year.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Right, okay.  So look for continued information there.  And then just elaborate a little bit about\u2014so Europe, as you said, more challenging.  No new news there.  Rest of world \u2013 mixed.  So maybe if you\u2019d elaborate a little bit \u2013 you said two particular regions where there was pullback on inventory, increased pricing, and some impact on sales.  Can you remind us of what those were?","Bret Wise","Yeah, I don\u2019t want to give you the regions from a competitive standpoint, but in two of the larger regions in what we call rest of world, we increased prices coming into this quarter, we reduced promotional activity, and we did that because we saw dealer inventories getting too high.  We wanted to get them a little bit lower and leaner, and we wanted to improve our margins; so we reduced the promotional activity and that had the expected impact of restraining growth just for this one quarter.  It should bounce back next quarter.","But overall in the rest of world region, particularly in the emerging markets or developing markets, our performance continues to be very strong and that will continue to be a growth driver for us next year.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Second thing, just a little bit of elaboration on the communication around Astra Tech.  You mentioned now sort of an integrated team in place with the brands staying the same in some of the implants, dedicated healthcare platform, and top-level leadership.  Can you reflect on\u2014I know some of the conversation before had been about the investments that Astra Tech had made that you\u2019re going to be able to leverage with your focus on costs and consolidation and coordination with your other brands, and I think a lot of confidence in the management team of the healthcare platform you acquired.  So just looking at 2012 as you see what you\u2019ve done already with Astra Tech, do you feel like your\u2014it sounds like the message is you\u2019re right on plan with every component of what you hope to achieve, and is it fair to say that your view of overall dental implant market growth is no different or no worse than it was when you acquired the asset?","Bret Wise","A couple of things there \u2013 first of all, with respect to our ability to increase operating margins of the combined business, I think that\u2019s clearly on track, although the first three months there\u2019s a little bit of chaos so we\u2019re working through how best to create the value as one organization on the dental implant side, and I think we\u2019re making good progress there under Jim\u2019s leadership.","With respect to healthcare, we\u2019re very pleased with their performance with the quality of the people running that business and with their capabilities, we think, to grow that business going forward.  ","With respect to the dental implant market, now we\u2019re the fourth major player to report. I think we\u2019ve seen a range of results, organic growth range of results of slightly negative to maybe positive 2%.  We\u2019re positive mid-single digits; there\u2019s another large player to report yet, but I think with all those data points put together, you have to believe that the market must be growing single digits, or in the fourth quarter was growing low single digits.  ","In our acquisition model, we expected kind of low to mid-single digits for 2011 and probably a good part of 2012, but we were expecting that market to pick up later in 2012.  That\u2019s yet to be seen.  We\u2019re hopeful that will happen.  But in the U.S., the market is extraordinarily strong and underpenetrated, so I would say the U.S. market is now growing close to double digits and we expect that to continue as we see employment improve and this economy tick up.  Europe is going to be a little bit tougher this year, for obvious reasons, but we\u2019ll just have to see how that develops as we go.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay.  And fair to say when you first announced the acquisition, you had said $0.12 to $0.17 of accretion on sort of adjusted earnings basis first full year after close.  Is that still an appropriately wide range, or are you able to narrow that or think about that differently now?","Bret Wise","Well, we\u2019re not going to give an update on the range of accretion of Astra Tech, although you can see in our earnings guidance there\u2019s a meaningful impact there.  We\u2019re pleased with the outlook of that business from both a sales growth and an earnings perspective, and the ability to continue to innovate and invest in it.  So obviously the 2.22 to 2.30 includes a meaningful component from Astra Tech and we think we\u2019re on target.  ","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great.  And then just a quick clarification on the tax rate \u2013 it sounds like a little bit of a good guy there.  I was thinking it to be more like 24, 25.  I guess, Bill, you\u2019re saying 23 is your thought, even with Astra Tech; so that\u2019s just good asset management and I think that\u2019s something that you think would be sustainable even after 2012 as you look forward.","William Jellison","Yeah, we\u2019ve got a lot of activity going on around that aspect.  Any time you do a major international acquisition as well, too, there\u2019s a lot of restructuring or structuring-related activities that take place, and especially around the tax side.  There are projects that are still in the works associated with that that will come to fruition as we move through this period, but at this point we\u2019re comfortable with the 23% estimation.","Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yeah, okay, I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs.","","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, thanks for the questions.  Just sticking with Astra Tech, it looks like it added about 150 million this quarter.  I was curious how that matched up relative to your internal expectations, and then maybe how we should think about that relative to your annual run rate expectations.","Bret Wise","Frankly, it\u2019s right on.  What we had said when we announced the deal is we thought we were paying\u2014by the time the deal would close, we\u2019d be paying about three times sales on a trailing basis, which would be $600 million.  They\u2019ve hit those numbers in the period that we\u2019ve owned them.  They\u2019ve met our expectations, and they\u2019re continuing to deliver really pretty strong results.  So I would say it\u2019s right in line with what we expected.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","","Okay, great.  And then I think you just commented on this, Bret, but for the implant expectations, the market itself in 2012, could you maybe just share with us what\u2019s the underlying assumption behind the guidance for the implant market globally?","Bret Wise","I think the implant market globally will be low single digits to perhaps moving into the mid-single digit range, but probably at the low end of that.  My belief is that it will start out reasonably weak, kind of low single digits.  I mean, we\u2019ll learn a lot more when the last of the five majors report; but later in the year, particularly if Europe works through some of its problems, that could accelerate.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it.  And then just relative to third quarter, did that market stay the same, decelerate, accelerate?","Bret Wise","I think the overall market was the same to maybe slightly slower.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got you.  And then just the last one I had on Astra Tech, it sounds like you\u2019re separating out the medical business.  Any update or anything we should read from that on whether or not this is being viewed as a strategic asset for the Company going forward?","Bret Wise","It is a strategic asset for the Company.  The reason we\u2019re separating it, obviously, is we have two major dental implant businesses that we need to bring together in integration, and it makes no sense to bring those together in an organization that has the healthcare business also merged into it.  So we\u2019re trying to separate it to give it it\u2019s own life.  We\u2019ve got dedicated management.  We\u2019re making some investments there that we think will help that business grow, and I think you should view that as the same as you view our other 45 businesses.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got you, that makes a lot of sense.  Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Glen Santangelo at Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, thanks a lot.  Bill, I just wanted to follow up with you on some of the FX comments you made earlier.  You seemed to suggest that FX cost you about two pennies in the quarter \u2013 was that correct?","William Jellison","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","And so I thought if I heard you correctly, you said that for \u201912 if the currencies kind of stay where they are, it would be about a 3 to 4% top line headline impact, but you didn\u2019t give the bottom line.  Am I correct in assuming it\u2019d be about a 4% impact on the bottom line in fiscal \u201912 as well?","William Jellison","Yeah, I think from your perspective on the earnings side of the equation, obviously it makes a big difference on which currencies are stronger or weaker within that average, because they all don\u2019t move in the same direction.  But if you look at what we show on our presentation as well too and the grid there to give you some guidance on how earnings move relative to the sales side, earnings do move at least a little bit more in line with that if currencies are moving in the same direction.  So yeah, you could think that it\u2019s somewhere in that probably 3 to 4% range as well.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks.  And it kind of sounds like\u2014I\u2019m just trying to reconcile all the moving pieces relative to your guidance, because it kind of sounds like obviously you\u2019re going to have an FX headwind in fiscal \u201912, but an obvious benefit from Astra Tech as well as it sounds like the orthodontic business can be a positive contributor year-over-year.  And so if I kind of reconcile all those pieces, it kind of sounds like you\u2019re implying kind of mid to high single-digit organic-y PS growth in fiscal \u201912.  Are there any other big swing factors or moving pieces I should be thinking about?","William Jellison","No, I think that that\u2019s reasonable for how you\u2019re thinking about that on that side.  I\u2019d say on the orthodontics piece as well, as Bret mentioned, that first quarter we were originally expecting that we were going to already see some sequential improvement in the first quarter on ortho.  That\u2019s obviously not taken place, so we\u2019re thinking that this year, because the first half is obviously going to be a drag, that it will probably take pretty much through the second half of the year to kind of offset that negative impact that\u2019s occurring in that first half of the year.  So orthodontic for us right now is expected to kind of be flat, maybe a slight positive; but that\u2019s probably a little bit softer than we would have expected before.  But yes, your other components that you were talking about there make sense in relationship to the guidance that we\u2019re putting out there.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","And Bret, maybe if I could just ask one follow-up question on the ortho business \u2013 it kind of sounds like you believe that it\u2019s reasonable to think that we\u2019re going to have a full re-launch of the product by the middle of the year to help out the back half of the year.  I guess what my question is, is how confident are you in this recovery plan because presumably these orthodontists are buying their self-ligating brackets somewhere else and so as the supply improves, how confident are you that you\u2019ll be able to win all that market share back beginning in the back half of this year?","Bret Wise","Well, I\u2019m not confident we can win all the market share back in the back half of this year.  I think this will be a multi-year recovery plan, but what gives me some confidence is right now we\u2019re trying to sell products that we\u2019re on backorder on, which is not an easy thing to do.  So once we have full supply or a full range of products and we can get that in the hands of our reps, it makes their job a lot easier.  I think that with respect to the recovery plan, some of the market share we\u2019ll get back quickly \u2013 you know, loyal customers that are hanging with us and we\u2019re trying to serve their needs through allocation, et cetera.  Some of it will be a little bit longer term project, and of course once a customer converts, sometimes you don\u2019t get them all back at all.  So I do think this is a multi-year thing, and in our guidance we\u2019re not counting on getting a major part of the market share back in the back half of the year.  We\u2019re counting on having full supply so that we can get the customers that we have now off backorder.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","So as I think about into fiscal \u201913, not that you want to talk that far out, but theoretically, presumably it\u2019s going to be an ongoing process of you regaining market share, which could be a benefit to you in fiscal \u201913 versus \u201912 as well.","Bret Wise","I think that\u2019s very fair to assume.  That\u2019s a good assumption.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks for the comments.","Bret Wise","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Kreger at William Blair.","Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair","","Hi, good morning guys.  This is actually Robbie Fatta in for John Kreger today.  Bill, I think I heard you say you were guys were starting to take a look at some small and mid-sized acquisitions recently.  Can you give us any more detail on where those might be focused geographically and functionally?","William Jellison","Well, I didn\u2019t really say that we were looking, although we\u2019re always looking.  But I said that on the cash flow side, if we did use any of the cash flow for acquisitions, that may offset any of the pay down, although it\u2019s our expectation in 2012 that we are going to still pay down a significant amount of that debt.  On the acquisition side, though, similar to any time, we\u2019re always looking at different opportunities both in different regions as well as in the primary key product categories that we have out there.  So when and if those come to fruition is up in the air.  You never know when those happen, but you can be assured that we\u2019re still always looking at a number of different opportunities.","Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair","Got it, thanks.  And is there any update on the potential launch of the MTM product in the United States?","Christopher Clark","No, at this point, Robbie, we\u2019re still in the U.S. waiting for FDA approval, and again, that\u2019s hard to predict exactly when that\u2019s going to happen.","Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair","Got it.  How has the product gained traction outside the U.S. in the geographies you have launched it?","Christopher Clark","Yeah, we\u2019re certainly gaining some traction with it.  I would say it\u2019s early in the launch process, if you will, but at this point in time I wouldn\u2019t see anything that I\u2019d be concerned about.","Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair","Great.  Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Brandon Couillard at Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, good morning.  Bret, what\u2019s your sense of the general demand environment, I guess specifically in the U.S.?  Do you still feel like there\u2019s a pent-up demand scenario in the market, and what is your sense of the strength in the U.S.?  Can you quantify maybe how much might be attributable to better utilization trend versus the new product contribution?","Bret Wise","Sure, Brandon.  I think a couple things \u2013 when the U.S. hit the skids in late 2008, early 2009, we saw unemployment really skyrocket, and we saw that cause the dental market to kind of go flat to just slightly negative, despite the fact that unemployment went from 5% to 10%, which was a body blow to the economy.  But the dental market still performed pretty well in that environment, and what our thesis has been all along because of how we\u2019ve seen it in past recessions is the dental market will kind of flatten out and start to grow again.  Even though unemployment is still high, it will grow modestly; but once we see employment start to improve meaningfully month after month, the dental market can really accelerate because we\u2019re adding a whole new slew of customers to a low baseline already.  ","Our theory is that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now.  I mean, we saw the results of a major distributor yesterday.  They had very strong consumable growth, near 5%.  You see our number here of 7.6.  I think that\u2019s reflective of higher utilization in general and the market improving in general, particularly in the United States; and then our number at 7.6 I think is also reflective of some very strong uptake on these new products that we\u2019re launching.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks.  And then I believe dental reimbursement in Germany is stepping up somewhere in the 5 to 6% range next year.  How might that impact your demand trends there, if at all?","Bret Wise","Well I think in Germany there\u2019s a little bit of confusion about what\u2019s going on there.  I think in the private part of the market, which is maybe 15, 20% of the market, it\u2019s a regulated market, meaning a dentist can only charge so much for a given procedure.  And the change that happened was there was a pretty meaningful increase in that regulated price \u2013 how much a dentist could charge.  It wasn\u2019t necessarily a change in reimbursement; it was just a change in how much they can charge the customer.  I don\u2019t think that that will have a major impact \u2013 some dentists will charge a higher price, some will not.  I think that it\u2019s not really a change in reimbursement, it\u2019s just a change in what the price can be charged.","The same thing happened in Holland, by the way, and there\u2019s been a little bit of an increase in the government funding to the market in the U.K., which was encouraging.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, fair enough.  And then last one \u2013 Bill, the cash flow experience seemed pretty strong in the fourth quarter.  I know Astra Tech generally has a lower cash conversion cycle than the legacy X-ray profile.  Should we anticipate continued progress there on the working capital front as you get a full year of Astra contribution, and can you give us a better sense of your operating cash flow expectations for the year?","William Jellison","Well I\u2019d say on the working capital side, especially both in 2011 and in 2012, there\u2019s a lot of different activities that are in there because of a number of these non-GAAP adjustments that are impacting it associated with the acquisition and other items that are kind of distorting a little bit, as I mentioned.  I think our cash flow in general at the 393 range in 2011, as I mentioned, includes some of those additional outflows of cash as well, so we would expect that that would be stronger.  As we look at their operations, you heard the inventory numbers and even the receivable numbers that we talked about, and actually Astra Tech\u2019s were pretty much in line with where we\u2019re at.  I think that we\u2019ve got a lot of additional activities and focus areas in this, and I think over the next couple years as we continue to integrate this business, we think that there will be some opportunities on the working capital end as well.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Steve Beuchaw at Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi.  Thanks and good morning.  I wonder if you could give us an update with a bit more granular detail on the end markets in Europe geographically, by product line.  Did you see any of the incremental weakness and more recent rebound in some of the core markets like Germany that others have cited?  Is there any sign of incremental weakness in peripheral Europe?  How might that answer be different, say, in implants relative to consumables?","Bret Wise","Well I think generally the market in Europe has weakened.  That\u2019s not necessarily our results, but the market in Europe weakened sequentially in the fourth quarter.  It\u2019s a mixed bag \u2013 southern Europe is very weak, the mature part of Europe is kind of stable or maybe a little bit up or a little bit down, depending on the market.  The CIS region, which we include in Europe, continues to be pretty strong.  So it\u2019s a mixed bag.","In particular on dental implants, I mean, we\u2019ve seen the results of these three other competitors, which it looks like they were all very negative in Europe.  Our results were still positive in Europe organically, but I think that\u2019s a sign that the dental implant market in Europe, at least, has weakened somewhat sequentially.  I think that\u2019s probably the case.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then another question on the U.S. market, which I know you\u2019ve touched on but I wanted to get more specific to trends in the fourth quarter.  Can you spend a bit more time there on the detail and the strength sequentially in the end markets \u2013 is that more base consumables or endo, or are you seeing more of an aesthetic rebound, again thinking specifically about the quarter and what you\u2019re seeing here in the early days of \u201912.","Bret Wise","Okay, this is going to sound like a gross general statement, but it\u2019s true \u2013 we saw sequential improvement in every platform we have in the U.S. except for orthodontics, which of course is because of those other circumstances.  But it was across the board, and frankly if you go back to our comments in the third quarter, it was across the board then as well.  We\u2019ve had two quarters back-to-back where we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement across essentially all of our platforms in the U.S. in both the third and fourth quarter.","Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.  Thanks again, guys, and have a great morning.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Block at SunTrust.","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust","Thanks guys and good morning.  Bill, maybe the first question for you, just more from a modeling perspective.  When we think about OPEX into 2012 based on your comments from Astra Tech and the orthodontics division, should we think about the OPEX leverage starting to come back in the third quarter of \u201912 once you annualize a bit of Astra, or is that still a bit too soon considering that deal closed in September, and think about a little bit of OPEX leverage in 4Q \u201912 and then accelerating into \u201913.","William Jellison","Well, I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that from a mix perspective that you\u2019ll probably see similar mix impacts both in gross margin and SG&A in kind of the OPEX area as you saw in the fourth quarter as we move into both the first, second and even third quarters of this year, until we fully anniversary that.  I\u2019d say as you get into the third quarter, you\u2019re going to see some where it\u2019s already been annualized on the Astra Tech, at least in the month of September; and then on the ortho side, again, we were already beginning to feel more of the heavier impacts in the third quarter, so we would expect that the third quarter won\u2019t get worse from that perspective.  It should begin to show improvements on the ortho front.","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust","Okay, great.  And then this builds a little bit on the earlier question in Europe, but there was obviously a ton of headline risk throughout the quarter, yet your results picked up a bit in Europe from 3Q to 4Q when you ex-out the ortho.  So maybe just some commentary \u2013 is that just pulled up a little bit by having a full quarter of Astra in there, and I think you mentioned Astra\u2019s business was in and around mid-single digits.  How are you guys able to sidestep a bit of the weakness in the overall market in Europe 3Q to 4Q?","Bret Wise","I think it\u2019s kind of specific for us, but for us it was we\u2019re launching a really powerful portfolio of new products, not just in Europe but globally.  You see the impact of that in the United States numbers as well.  But it\u2019s clear from the analysis that we\u2019ve done that it\u2019s the uptick from those products that\u2019s driving this 2.8% growth we had in the quarter, much more than the overall market is growing.  For instance, the Astra Tech number is not in that 2.8, right, because this was internal growth, not total growth.  So for us, it\u2019s much more a story of innovation, bringing new products to market that are changing the way dentistry is done and getting great uptake from those\u2014even in a rough environment in Europe, getting great uptake from those in our portfolio.  ","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust","Okay, great.  And maybe just a last question.  You mentioned the U.S. business or the U.S. implant market growing in and around double digits.  Just when you take a step back, are you seeing any change in the evolution of the market; and what I mean by that is a GP\u2019s willingness to move forward and take on a greater share of the implant business.  And if that\u2019s the case, are you seeing anything that you can point to on a share shift of maybe a GP being more willing to swim downstream in terms of the type of implant they\u2019re using?  Thanks, guys.","Bret Wise","Okay, it\u2019s kind of a complex question, but what we see is actually GPs being much more interesting in restoring implants rather than placing them.  We have in the past seen GPs or the GP market buy a kit, 10 implants, they place one or maybe they place two, and then it goes on the shelf.  We haven\u2019t seen a big uptake in GPs becoming large users of dental implants.  On the contrary, what we\u2019ve seen is GPs partnering with a surgeon to drive implant placement for their patients, but they\u2019re focused more on restoring the implant rather than placing it.","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust","Okay, thanks for your time, guys.","Bret Wise","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to George Humphrey at Deutsche Bank.","George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Morning.  First question just on Cad\/Cam - could you tell me how quickly that grew in Q4 please?","Bret Wise","Well, Cad\/Cam is not a major market for us.  That\u2019s more of an equipment market, and of course we\u2019re a consumable company.  We did launch this year a new monolithic material called Cercon ht.  We launched it Europe mid-year and we launched it in the U.S., really kind of a soft launch in December \u2013 it got approved by the FDA in November.  We\u2019ve seen great uptake in that product, which is a Cad\/Cam type product, but it\u2019s a consumable more than the equipment.  ","So with respect to the equipment, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re the best measure of how that market is going.","George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Sure, okay.  Thank you.  And then just going back to dental implants, was there much difference in performance between Dentsply and the Astra Tech dental implant businesses in Q4?","Bret Wise","Well, we view those as one business now.  That\u2019s why we gave you the pro forma number that we did.  And as we bring those two business together, for instance, certain product lines that used to be resident in one business are now being moved across to the other platform.  So like the rest of our businesses, when we give you insights we don\u2019t break it down by three or four businesses within a category.  We kind of give you insights on directionally how our business is doing in total, and that\u2019s why we gave you the mid-single digit number here on the call today.","George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, okay.  Thank you.  And then just the final question on the dental implants market as a whole, just in terms of your overall expectation of growth in 2012, do you see much difference in the premium part of the market versus the budget part of the implant market?","Bret Wise","Well, my comments earlier were about the premium segment primarily.  There\u2019s not much insight really into the budget part.  I mean, we do have an interest in a company in South Korea that\u2019s kind of a value implant player; but outside of that, it\u2019s hard to get good statistics on the value segment.  So the comments I had about probably low, perhaps getting into mid-single digit growth next year, were for the premium segment.","George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great.  Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And that does conclude the question and answer\u2014oh, I\u2019m sorry, we do have one more question.  We\u2019ll go to Greg Halter at Great Lakes Review.","Greg Halter \u2013 Great Lakes Review","Yes, good morning guys, and thanks for letting me in here at the end.","Bret Wise","You\u2019re coming in under the wire.","Greg Halter \u2013 Great Lakes Review","Yes, thank you, and this goes across overseas, so a long question!  I know you have some sort of either options or warrants, or some sort of derivative in the Dio Corp, and I think the stocks doubled or tripled here recently.  Just wondered if you could make any comments on your position there.","William Jellison","Yeah, we did do an investment a year ago December in that company.  We\u2019re very pleased with the acquisition and our involvement in that at this stage.  We think that they\u2019re making some good progress on a number of fronts, but as far as the comment associated with their current stock price or what our expectations are on the conversion of\u2014you know, the converts that we do have out there or the rights, we wouldn\u2019t obviously comment on any of that at this point.","Greg Halter \u2013 Great Lakes Review","Okay.  Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude the question and answer session.  At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to Mr. Leckow for any closing remarks.","Derek Leckow","Well thank you everyone.  That concludes our conference call today.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Derek Leckow","Thank you, Kayla. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s third quarter 2015 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

Bret?","Bret Wise","Thank you, Derek. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning on our third quarter call. I\u2019m going to give some brief overview comments on our results and our strategies and then turn over the call to Jim and Chris for more details on both the operating objectives and the financial results. ","As an overview, DENTSPLY continues to execute well and consistent with our strategy in a global market that we view as stable. With what we had seen earlier in the year, this market view is generally consistent across most of the geographies, although I would add that the third quarter is always the most difficult read through on trends, particularly in Europe. For DENTSPLY specifically, we\u2019ve been executing on our strategy to first create a significant improvement in the efficiency of our global platform and then once the program gains momentum, to use a portion of those savings to accelerate growth investments. As you\u2019ve seen in recent quarters and I think will be evident again today, we\u2019ve been very successful in significantly improving our margin profile and I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re well ahead of plan that we put forth to you early last year. ","In order to have us on the same base line, you\u2019ll remember that in April 2014 or about 18 months ago, we announced the global efficiency program with an objective to increase our margin profile to 20%, our operating margin profile to 20% by2017 and that would have been a 240 basis point improvement off of the 17.6% margin we reported in 2013. The second objective of the program and perhaps the most important objective, was then to use a portion of the savings generated above this objective to reinvest in growth opportunities while still meeting or exceeding the operating margin target. The operating margin target was a net target, net of the reinvestment. The results of the program are now very apparent. Using our first nine months of 2015, our adjusted operating margin is at 20.3%. It\u2019s now up 270 basis points from the 2013 base line and has exceeded the interim target of 20% that we set for 2017. We\u2019ve gotten there quite a bit earlier than we\u2019d expected. ","This quarter, like the second quarter, was very strong with operating margins up 220 basis points and adjusted earnings per share up 6.5% and that\u2019s despite a very big headwind from currency on the topline, but also on the adjusted EPS line. Actually the headwind on currency on adjusted earnings per share was in the mid 6% range. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS, the adjusted EPS improvement this quarter would be well into the double digits. Two other important points on margins. Although currency is a negative on the absolute amount of earnings or operating income, is actually helpful in the percentage operating margin measure. It\u2019s important to note that about a third of the improvement this quarter in the operating margin percentage is from currency. ","The second important point is thus far in the program we\u2019ve been reinvesting a portion of the savings to facilitate the program itself, that being an investment in systems, consultants et cetera. The need for these investments to facilitate the program will now diminish a bit while the savings will be accelerating. At this point, we\u2019re somewhat of an inflection point in the program where additional funds will be available for growth investments and I\u2019ve asked Jim to give you more of that in a moment in his comments.","This is an exciting time internally as we\u2019ve been doing a lot of very hard work to get to this moment when we can begin the growth investments in earnest. It\u2019s also important to note that although we\u2019ve designed the program implemented thus far to minimize the impact on the commercial organizations and thus minimize the impact on sales growth, there certainly has been some negative impact. I can\u2019t really quantify that for you, but I think it\u2019s important to note that as we now turn to growth investments, we can help mitigate that impact and more and begin to reap the benefits both on the top and bottom line as we enter 2016. ","So turning to growth, internal growth in the quarter was a positive 1.7%. Regionally it was up 1.6% in the US, up 0.3% in Europe and up 4.8% in rest of world. I have just a few analytical comments to help you with that. On the global measure, the impact of discontinued products from our lab restructuring was about 50 basis points negative, while the US component of that impact of discontinued products was the largest at 100 basis points. We said on earlier calls that we\u2019ll give you this impact. However, we are not adjusting the reported internal growth for the discontinued products or services at this point. So that headwind is in the reported numbers. ","In Europe, the reported number is a positive 0.3. This was negatively impacted by the discontinued products by about 25 to 30 basis points. CIS was also still negative. It was down. It reduced the European number by about 30 basis points in the quarter. In rest of world, we were pretty happy with the growth in most of the countries. The one notable exception was the group of countries we call the Pacific Rim, which is included in rest of world, which was up mid-single digits on a reported basis in the quarter. ","However, this is well short of recent performance and the expectations we had going into the quarter. The main reason for this was the temporary loss of our production facility and our distribution facility in Tianjin, China. Our facility is in very close proximity to the port where the chemical explosion occurred back in August and we did sustain substantial damage and our facility was unavailable for either manufacturing or logistics and shipping for five to six weeks in the quarter. We\u2019re back up with both production and shipping now and we expect this disruption to be temporary. However, it did have a meaningful negative impact on our rest of world growth in the quarter. ","As we enter Q4, we have a pretty good pipeline of new products coming over the next several quarters and as Jim will note in a moment, we\u2019re now starting to implement our growth investments. Both of these of course should help accelerate our topline moving into next year. Just one last comment. This change towards growth investments for me is really important as we\u2019re now at a point where we have the most flexibility to invest in growth than really any other time since the recession. Now this of course is due to the hard work and dedication of our more than 11,000 employees around the world and we\u2019re all very pleased that we can now move to the next phase of the initiative. ","On guidance, we\u2019re once again increasing the earnings range for 2015 by bringing up the bottom end of the range by $0.04 and the top of the range by $0.02. This brings us to a new range for adjusted EPS of $2.58 to be at $2.64 for the year. On the operating margin target, of course we\u2019ve already exceeded the goal we set back in early 2014 and we\u2019ll be looking at that and we\u2019ll give you further guidance on the target on our year end call. Needless to say there\u2019s good upside to the target that we had set earlier and of course now achieved. ","Of course our discussion this morning would not be complete without a few comments on the Sirona merger. As you know, we announced a historic merger with Sirona back in September. This is a very exciting event for both companies, but also for our markets. By bringing together the best in technology equipment and consumables, we believe that we can deliver more innovation and more value to our customers than either company could deliver on its own. We\u2019re of course currently in the process of filing for regulatory approval and have pending shareholder approval for both companies and we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016. Although we\u2019ll not say a lot more about the merger in this call, it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re very enthusiastic about the potential of this transaction and also the future we have together with Sirona and their employees. ","That concludes my prepared remarks. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Jim to speak to our operating initiatives. Jim?","Jim Mosch","Thank you, Bret. I\u2019d like to provide an operational update for Q3 and also provide some further perspective on 2015 initiatives. I\u2019ll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review.","In looking at our Q3 sales performance, our global consumables business grew mid-single digits and we believe above market, with growth led by rest of world, solid growth in the US and also positive in Europe. Our procedural selling programs and new product launches continues to support our consumable business globally. ","Dental specialties grew low single digits, with growth somewhat impacted by generally slow conditions in Europe, continued price competition in the orthodontics market and contraction in CIS and the specialties. These factors were favorably offset by several new products in our endodontic business, Ortho volume growth in the US, expansion of our line of business and continued good performance with our EV Implant system introduced last year. ","Our lab business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, which was heavily influenced by the impact of discontinued products. We have outlined previously the global restructuring of our lab business, which includes discontinuing certain commoditized lines, selling some product lines, and or businesses and also right sizing the cost structure away from what had historically been a precious metal based market. The restructuring will be substantially completed at the end of this year. However, there will be an impact through the middle of next year as we anniversary the discontinuation of several product lines. We have now initiated all major elements of the restructuring and are confident that this will lead to improved commercial focus and profitability, driven by a streamlined portfolio and transition to higher growth and more profitable laboratory materials. ","As we move to Q4, we have several new product launches planned across our businesses. Our restorative business launched CeramX Universal in the month of September and has generated over 1,000 new users. This is a universal composite with natural aesthetics due to a unique sphere tech, spherical filler technology. CeramX provides superior handling without compromising the long term performance characteristics. Also within our restorative group, our Midwest division will launch the Midwest Tradition Plus. The original Tradition high-speed hand piece is one of most recognized and utilized hand pieces in the North American market. The new Tradition Plus incorporates superior features, improved reliability and significant improvements in power, with superior vibration and noise reduction. ","Our preventive business will launch the Cavitron Touch Ultrasonic scaling unit with Steri-Mate 360. This will be one of the most significant upgrades of our market leading Cavitron Ultrasonic Scaler in several years. The Cavitron Touch will be a much smaller footprint, incorporate a touch screen interface, a lightweight petite cord and superior swivel feature, enabling improved access and ergonomics for the clinician. We anticipate solid uptakes of these products in Q4, but certainly greater impact as these products are rolled out globally over the ensuing quarters. ","In addition to the products noted here, we have several other product launches planned in the quarter and into 2016, which will be on display at the Greater New York Dental Meeting in November and also the Chicago Midwinter Meeting in February. From an overall perspective, we see the pace of new product launches pick up substantially in 2016. We\u2019re excited about the pipeline of new products coming to market over the next couple of quarters, certainly more than normal products flow. ","As Bret outlined, we continue to make good progress against our 20% margin operating goal and in some aspects, we\u2019re ahead of schedule. At this point, we would like to provide more detail on our reinvestment initiatives to support long term growth as identified as part of the global efficiency program. As indicated previously, within our manufacturing segments, we will focus on global product platforms by clinical discipline. An important element of this is to translate global portfolio strategies to commercial execution through the regional commercial organizations. Structurally, this requires the addition of in-market expertise by each global portfolio. We are making investments under which each business discipline will have dedicated resources located in the respective geographic markets to support technical market and competitive development and we anticipate staffing more than 50 individuals to support this requirement by the end of Q1 2016. ","We have also highlighted our commitment to sales excellence, which is training and develop as well as sales force expansion. We continuously review our sales force alignment and deployment and we have concluded to add sales representatives across multiple businesses and geographic regions. We are beginning this activity now and we\u2019ll have some personnel in place by yearend, although the majority of these positions will be filled by Q1. In an effort to support sales expansion and effecting and our sales cores globally, we have launched a global sale excellence program, which will seek to standardize and expand our sales training development efforts on a global basis. A complementary strategy to this is to expand clinical education, which is also underway. With several innovation approaches to design and deployment, this investment will be based on clinically relevant training and education, with a particular emphasis on procedural consistency and enhanced performance. ","Finally, as we noted previously, we are moving to independent businesses in country to fully integrated DENTSPLY country organizations, which will result in five countries going live by January 1, 2016. While it is early in the process, we\u2019re seeing leverage of critical mass and the collaboration of a single country management team that we believe will accelerate common customer strategies and commercial success as the country organizations develop. ","At present, it\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s a lot of activity at DENTSPLY. It is both satisfying and exciting that we are now at an insertion point in our efficiency program, as almost an exclusively cost driven focus now becomes more balanced as we turn to investments and growth initiatives. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward.","At this point, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Chris Clark for the financial review.","Chris Clark ","Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our third quarter results by reviewing key elements of our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement and also provide some additional color on our margin improvement initiatives. For the third quarter, sales excluding metals declined 7.7% compared to prior year as internal growth of 1.7% was more than offset by negative currency translation of 9.1%. ","Net acquisition growth was negative 0.3% in the quarter. That\u2019s primarily reflecting the impact of several small divestitures of non-core product lines that more than offset the impact from acquisitions. Also as Bret mentioned, the impact of discontinued products reduced the quarter\u2019s internal growth rate by approximately 50 basis points. ","We continued our very strong operating margin performance in the third quarter as our operating margin rate of 20.9% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, improved by 220 basis points over 18.7% in the prior year quarter. This represents the accelerating impact of our global efficiency improvement initiative, which I will provide more perspective on in a moment. ","For the first three quarters of 2015, our adjusted margin operating rate of 20.3% represents 170 basis points improvement, over the same period in 2014. Approximately one third of the operating margin improvement this quarter was the result of currency, which continues to be a headwind to our sales and earnings, but is a tailwind currently to our operating margin rate. Currency will become a headwind to our operating margin rate in 2016 if rates remain similar to today, but will be more than offset by savings from the efficiency program. At this point, we would expect margin expansion next year despite this. We will update you more when we report our year end results. ","Gross profit on an adjusted basis in the third quarter was 60.1% of sales, excluding precious metals and that\u2019s an improvement of 240 basis points over prior year. SG&A expenses on adjusted basis were 39.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, and that\u2019s up 10 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2014. We are seeing benefits from the global efficiency program in both our cost of goods sold and also on OpEx, with a disproportional amount of the enabling investments also going through the OpEx line at this point in time. ","As I mentioned, we continue to be very pleased with the progress of our global efficiency program as the P&L impact from our aggregate efforts continues to accelerate. Our initiatives driving these impacts represents significant changes to our structure and to our operational approach and they allow us to better leverage our underlying asset and expense basis. We continue to move forward with implementation of the restructuring of our lab business that we discussed on last quarters call and we\u2019re pleased with the sequential improvement in operational result associated with our actions, as well as the forward looking orientation of that business, now that we\u2019ve moved from planning into implementation. Of course, as mentioned, this is creating a drag on our topline due to discontinued products, but the operational leverage gained is significant and is on plan. The savings from this effort will continue to build over the next several quarters as will the drag on internal growth. ","In addition, in the third quarter, we closed one additional manufacturing location and announcement the impending closure of a second and this was consistent with our objective of divesting or discontinuing less profitable or non-core product lines, while also driving increased utilization of a smaller number of manufacturing facilities. ","Our global procurement initiative also continues to gain momentum, allowing us to realize the benefits of leveraging the buying power of a $2.8 billion company, as opposed to smaller decentralized business units. ","As Jim indicated, we have also largely implemented out global SVU structure, providing increased strategic and operational constituency, while also realizing synergies associated with running our verticals on a global rather than a regional basis. We\u2019re also moving forward with our country operating model in a number of geographies and that allows us to maintain the benefits of our SVU specific sales focus while also realizing the strategic and cost benefit of utilizing common country support structures. In addition to driving operating efficiencies, we believe this will significantly increase the level of collaboration across our businesses and thereby increase the value we can provide to common customers. ","Finally, we\u2019re moving forward with the consolidation of back office functions, including shared services supporting transactional accounting and also the initial phases of our logistics consolidation initiative. The impact of these strategic initiatives on our P&L on aggregate is accelerating and is a key driver of the strong operating margin performance we\u2019ve been discussing. In addition, this provides us the confidence to now increasingly pivot our focus to also include reinvestments in growth as Jim discussed. ","Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 21.1%. Our operating tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%. That\u2019s down 10 basis points compared to the third quarter rate of last year. For the first three quarters of the year, we continue to see a slight headwind in the tax rate of approximately 20 basis points as a result of unfavorable geographic earnings mix compared to prior year. ","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the third quarter was $84.6 million or $0.59 per diluted share. That compares to $75.3 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the release. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $93.5 million in the quarter, compared to $83.9 million in the prior year quarter and adjusted diluted EPS improved by 6.5% to $0.66 from last year\u2019s third quarter performance of $0.62. ","Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately 6.5% and the full year impact from currency based on current rates is estimated to be approximately $0.15 per share, which is about a penny per share worse than what our assumption was that was embedded in our initial guidance for the year.","Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $159.7 million. That\u2019s an 8% increase over last year\u2019s third quarter of $145.7 million. This represents a record third quarter cash flow performance and year to date our cash from operations now stands at $371 million and that\u2019s also a record for the first nine months of the year. Our free cash flow yield, which is calculated by taking operating cash flow less CapEx divided by market cap, was 6.9% at the end of the third quarter. Cash flow conversion continues to be excellent as our third quarter free cash flow of $141.4 million represented 151% of our adjusted net income for the period. ","Inventory finished with 115 days in September. That\u2019s down four days from prior year. Accounts receivable were -- I\u2019m sorry, were 60 days in September. That\u2019s also down 2 days from prior year and payable days improved by 7 days compared to prior year. Overall we\u2019re pleased with the status of our initiatives to improve working capital performance. Our overall operating results, combined with our improved asset turns, have driven solid results, solid improvements on our return on invested capital performance.","Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter, while depreciation was $23 million and amortization was $11 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 240,000 shares at an average cost of $56.12 per share. The first nine months of 2015, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.1 million shares. Our leverage ratio, defined as net debt over a trailing 12 month EBITDA, stood at 1.5 times at the end of September. We continue to see capital deployment as a driver of shareholder value through acquisitions and share buybacks, supported by our strong balance sheet and cash flow regeneration. ","I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on the timing of certain filings that we expect to complete in the coming days. In light of the upcoming merger with Sirona and related capital market activities, we will be filing a revision to some historical financials to conform to the segment reporting that we initiated in March of this year. As such, you will soon see a revision -- this revision in the form 10-K that will be filed shortly. In addition, we also anticipate refiling the S-4 Proxy Statement and our form 10-Q for the third quarter shortly thereafter.","Finally, as Bret indicated, based on our continued strong earnings performance, we are raising our 2015 earnings per share guidance to $2.58 to $2.64 on an adjusted basis. This reflects the strong momentum from our global efficiency program, the cost associated with the growth in investments that Jim mentioned and also a continued currency headwind of approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter based on current rates.","That completes our prepared remarks, we appreciate our support and now we would be glad to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operators Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first from John Kreger with William Blair.","Rob Metzger","Good morning guys. It\u2019s actually Robbie filing in for John today. Thanks for taking the questions. Just starting on the marketing steps, thanks for the detail and some of the onetime items that impacted growth in the quarter, but even adjusting for those, it seemed like there was a little bit of a deterioration in internal growth. Can you help us understand that? Are you seeing any packets of weakness or any particular areas where things seem to be slowing?","Bret Wise","Robbie, I\u2019ll take a shot at that. I think we prefaced our comments by the third quarter is probably the most difficult to evaluate trends in because we have extended vacation periods, particularly in Europe and then also the US can be affected by that as well. I think if you adjust for the discontinued products, the US probably is a little bit light this quarter. We don\u2019t recognize -- we don\u2019t see some overlying trends that caused that. It\u2019s just a few of our businesses were a little bit weaker than we thought they would be. We think that\u2019s probably timing. ","Europe was only up slightly in the quarter. Of course it was depressed by the CIS, although that\u2019s diminishing. In southern Europe, we saw continued growth. In northern Europe, it was more flattish, but that\u2019s where the impact from the discontinued products is hitting. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any material change in trends there. And in the rest of world category, we were in pretty good shape, except for this disruption we had in China because of the plant, the explosion of the plant at the port. Our plant didn\u2019t explode, but we did lose the access to that plant and the plant was damaged. Those factors would affect the rest of world. So I don\u2019t really -- I don\u2019t read a lot into the trends that we saw. I think the markets are stable and we are looking now to reinvest in certain markets where we see good growth potential.","Rob Metzger","Great. And on that point, it sounds like there were a couple of things that you mentioned in terms of new product introductions stepping up next year, rep additions increasing in Q4 and Q1. Can you give us any more detail on that? Maybe just contextualize how many more new products are expected, how many reps you expect to add and then maybe when you expect to see some of these reinvestments and growth to show up on the topline. Will it be a more 2016 event or more of 2017? Thanks. ","Bret Wise","Okay, I\u2019m going to take a stab at a couple of those questions and then ask Jim to address the new products. We gave you some insights on the number of technical people we are putting into the markets as part of the reinvestment Jim did this morning. With respect to the rep expansion, we are going to withhold that for now because that\u2019s competitively sensitive, but it\u2019s a meaningful addition that we\u2019ll be going in between now and the end of the first quarter. I don\u2019t think it will have any real effect in the fourth quarter, meaning we have to hire these people, onboard them, get them trained and get them out in the field. So I think it\u2019s more of a 2016 impact at this point, not a 2015 impact. Jim, you have some insights on the new product questions he raised?","Jim Mosch","Yeah, absolutely Robbie. From a standpoint, obviously what we outlined is we have a couple of key launches that are happening in Q4 of this year. I mentioned the Midwest can piece and also the new Cavitron. These are equipment products. They have a higher ticket price than our general consumables and it\u2019s always favorable that they have those launching at the end of the year and we expect some good performance from those. Obviously those products will carry going forward. In addition, as we look at next year, I think typically, ideally you\u2019d like to have a situation where you have this constant, consistent stream of new products. ","The reality is, is that there is somewhat of an ebb and flow to that process. And really what we are seeing right now is, we are seeing a pretty large wave of products that will be coming out in the first quarter. I can say that those are pretty much across all of our segments. We have a couple of notable additions in our healthcare business, also within our preventive business as well. So I believe that what you\u2019re going to see in really the first half of next year is pretty consistent new product additions across all segments.","Rob Metzger","Great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thanks guys. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Bret, let me just start with you on the topline kind of going back to Robbie\u2019s question. If we do the math and adjust per the China port issue and the lab divestitures, maybe organic growth 2.5%, a little north of that potentially. Probably a little bit below market at this point, although we\u2019ll see when some of the others report here if that\u2019s true or not. As we think about these investments and the new product flow Jim was just talking about, are those investments as we get into 2016, you think to drive the growth rate back up to market or nicely above market? Just how do we judge that and how should we scorecard you guys on that over the next few quarters?","Bret Wise","Okay, I\u2019ll take a shot at that, Jeff. At this point the only data point we have is one of the manufacturer that\u2019s reported and that sounded like their growth, organic growth was about like ours for consumables. So we\u2019ll know more of course when we have the two major dealers report and we get a couple of the other industry participants reporting. But I would guess we are close to market absence the things that were specific to us, like the discontinued products and the loss of the plant in China. ","The new investments, one thing I commented on in my prepared remarks was, we've been fighting this fight since the recession, meaning there hasn\u2019t been robust organic growth which means there is not excess earnings to put into growth initiatives. You might remember when we started this efficiency initiative, one of the major themes was to get our fixed cost down to give us flexibility to put money into growth initiatives. We are at that point now more so than any other point in the period since the recession. ","So I'm more optimistic now than I have been for probably five or six years that as we get these excess earnings and the ability to reinvest, we\u2019ll drive our organic growth above market. I don\u2019t want to concede that we are below market now. I'm not sure we are. I think that the one data point we've seen thus far says we are at about market right now. But I think the key is some variable spending that will allow us to push that higher and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to start to see as we move into 2016.","Jeff Johnson","All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then Chris, maybe just a couple of quick P&L clarifying questions. One is, as we think about the FX headwinds to margin rate or margin percentage next year, I know you don\u2019t want to give 2016 guidance, but can you talk just about kind of, are those going to be -- Should we be thinking about 30 to 50 basis points of headwinds from the margin, from the hedge issues or how should we think about the quantification of that?","Chris Clark","Yeah, if you look obviously the rates are moving around a lot, so it\u2019s going to be pretty variable. We\u2019ll give you a more formal update when we provide the guidance on the next call. At current rates it would be basically at the higher end of that range that you indicated. And again, it\u2019s -- At this point in time, that\u2019s based on today\u2019s rates and these are highly volatile.","Jeff Johnson","Yeah, understood. And then my last two, just I want to make sure the equity and affiliate lines, the $10.8 million, I think all that was excluded. That\u2019s probably a DO adjustment. I think all that was excluded in the non-GAAP EPS. Just want to confirm that. And then what drove the interest in other line down about $7 million year over year and then how did that impact or play into EPS?","Chris Clark","There is a couple of things going on there. You\u2019re right; the vast majority of the affiliated equity did pull out in the context of non-GAAP adjustment. That really relates to a transaction relative to DO where we redeemed the convertible bonds. We still are a minority shareholder, but the bonds were on the turn and we made the decision that it was not in our best interest at this stage to go ahead and redeem those at this point in time. Based on that, there are some mark to market elements that float through both that line as well as the interest and other. So those are the bulk of the adjustments.","Bret Wise","And those are pulled out.","Chris Clark","Those are removed from non-GAAP result, correct.","Jeff Johnson","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erin Wilson","Great, thanks. Can you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing regionally across the implant business? Have you been seeing any sort of meaningful changes in pricing or competitive dynamics just in light of the consolidation or actually as the disruption or integration processes actually helped you and how do you envision that market kind of evolving over the near and longer term?","Bret Wise","Okay, I\u2019ll take \u2013 Jim, you want to take a stab at it?","Jim Mosch","Yes, absolutely. Erin, I think form the standpoint of the implant market, I think we would say that it\u2019s been fairly stable over the last couple of quarters. Obviously we haven\u2019t seen a lot of reporting from the other implant players, so it\u2019s a little bit difficult to gauge their results. But overall, like I said we would say that the market has been fairly stable. Obviously the US is probably stronger versus Europe. Europe has been a little bit of a mixed bag, but really hasn\u2019t changed over the last couple of quarters. From the standpoint of the market overall, I think we would expect it to continue at its current pace. It might improve slightly next year. Competitive factors as far as pricing, average sale prices, some pressure on average sale prices, but not significant.","Bret Wise","The thing I\u2019d add to that is that our new system continues to get good uptake and it\u2019s a premium system. So we are getting good conversions from that new system at the price point that we got it marketed at. So that\u2019s a favorable data point I think. ","Erin Wilson","Okay, great. And you briefly touched on this, but can you speak to just the broader underlying demand trends in the US and how we should think about the quarterly progression here?","Bret Wise","Erin, I\u2019d say it\u2019s consistent with what I said before. In the US, August isn\u2019t a really great month to gauge. I would say the quarter probably started a little bit stronger than it finished, but we are talking a few basis points here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that I would read any material trend into. We are still getting good interest in new products that we bring to market. Our reps I think are doing a good job of maximizing those. So I think the trends are stable as we said in our prepared remarks in the US.","Erin Wilson","Okay and just one quick one. What\u2019s embedded in your expectations as far as it relates to the discontinued products in the fourth quarter?","Bret Wise","The fourth quarter I think is Christmas in fact.","Chris Clark ","It\u2019s accelerating. So as we look at it, we've got -- we obviously don\u2019t provide internal growth guidance basically. But included in our expectations for the quarter is an increasing headwind from the discontinued products.","Bret Wise","That will be a little bit heavier in Q4 and Q1 and then by midyear next year it will start to abate.","Chris Clark ","It will begin to come back down.","Erin Wilson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one for Bret. Bret, I\u2019d like to open the floor up and give you a chance to talk about what it is you\u2019re seeing in your dialogue over the last several weeks with investors as it relates to the Sirona transaction. Where you feel like you wanted to invest or needed to invest the most time to help people understand the merits of the deal, the parameters of the deal just to help people get comfortable as they think about the story.","Bret Wise","Steve, we are in the regulatory approval process right now and the process of filing for a trust approval and also shareholder approval. I think on this point we've got to stick to the script that we had at the time we did the announcement. The two companies are still operating independently of each other at this point. And so I think I\u2019d refer you back to the slide deck that we have from the announcement in mid-September. I don\u2019t think we can go any further than that on this call this morning.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, I had to try. Then I\u2019ll ask just two quick clarification questions. One on trend in the quarter. Setting aside the impact of discontinued operations, did you see anything in the channel as it relates to inventory in the distribution channel that might have been impactful on the results of the quarter?","Bret Wise","I'm going to start this and Chris if you have something to add. No. I think that we had a price increase October 1, which we do annually on October 1 and we saw kind of the same activity from the channel that we normally do. So no, I don\u2019t think I saw any material difference.","Chris Clark","No. Steve I guess I\u2019d add, I think our price increase was pretty similar to the rate it\u2019s been in prior years. Generally in that point to point and a half range. I think the behavior of our distributors was very similar to what it\u2019s been. There are some businesses that might have been a little bit longer or shorter in the context of the pre-buy but those tend to average out. And so I\u2019d say, overall pretty similar impact to what we've seen in the past.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay and then last one for me actually relates back to Tianjin. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that it was offline for five to six weeks and I believe you mentioned that that was in August. Have we seen any of that impact recapture and do you have a rough sense for the magnitude of the impact in the quarter? Sorry if I missed that in the prepared remarks. Thanks.","Bret Wise","I don\u2019t think we quantified that in the prepared remarks. I'm going to start this and then Chris if you want to quantify you can. The plant got back up and running and also we got availability of the inventory that was in the facility in late September. So we lost a good five weeks, maybe even six weeks, but it occurred, the explosion was in early August and by the time we exited the quarter, we had full access to the facility again. I just want to make clear that in a country like China where we import product into and we hold it in a logistics point, we don\u2019t have the flexibility to do a rush of new products into the country because they\u2019ve got to clear the port. So the fact that we lost access, not only the manufacturing, but to the inventory to ship, is what caused this disruption.","Chris Clark","Yeah. I think roughly the difference in trajectory on that business alone had about a 60 basis point impact approximately on the total internal growth number and about 300 basis points on rest of world. So again, it\u2019s hard to tell but if we look at the difference in trends, that\u2019s the impact.","Steve Beuchaw","Guys, thanks again. Have a good morning.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review.","David Stratton","Good morning. I just have a housekeeping question regarding the current liability. That jumped about 40% and I just want to make sure that that is all attributable to the long term debt drop being transitioned into current portion of long term debt. Thank you.","Chris Clark","That\u2019s exactly right. Yeah, you got it.","David Stratton","All right, thanks.","Bret Wise","I would add those liabilities will likely be refinanced.","Chris Clark","Yes, Correct. Our intentions are to refinance these in the near term, but they did move in the quarter from long-term to current.","Operator","[Operator instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning. Chris, on the working capital front, you made considerable progress of bringing down inventory. Should we expect that trend to level out as you build stocks for the new product launches coming up over the next say six to 12 months? And then could you give us a revised view on CapEx for the year?","Chris Clark","Yeah, sure. On the inventory obviously we don\u2019t provide guidance on a quarterly basis, but I guess I would say over a period of time, we've brought it down gradually. I would have the expectation that it continues to come down gradually. We may have an individual quarter where it may stay stable or come up a little bit based on either transitional items, transitional initiatives we have in the near term relative to the margin improvement initiatives, or quite frankly new products as you mentioned. ","But I guess they\u2019d take a longer time or moderate, intermediate term view on it Brandon to say that I would expect -- we've got considerable room to continue to bring this thing down. Relative to CapEx, at this point in time our CapEx expenditures are relatively modest based on historical trends so far. I think that that is an area again relative to our asset turns that we are focusing on. And I guess I would say for the year, I would anticipate it being in the $65 million to $80 million range for the year.","Brandon Couillard","Super. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Bret Wise","Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. I\u2019ll be around today for follow-ups. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation."],"6899":["DENTSPLY International (NASDAQ:XRAY) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  1, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Derek W.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Derek W. Leckow","Thank you, Richele. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's second quarter 2013 results. Joining me today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and CFO; and Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President and COO. We realize there are a number of other earnings reports this morning, so in the interest of time, we'll keep our prepared comments brief. I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued this morning. A copy of the release and the set of slides to accompany this call are also available for download on our website, www.dentsply.com.","I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and the U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's press release also pertain to this conference call. Certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements, as described on Page 1 of the company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances that may arise after the day of this call.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?","Bret W. Wise","Yes. Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call this morning. I have some brief comments on the market and our results, and then I'm going to turn it over to Jim and Chris for more in-depth discussion of the results.","First, starting with the market. Overall, in Q2, we saw the global market is relatively stable versus what we saw late last year and also in the first quarter this year. U.S. continues to be a growth market, where we are seeing reasonable volume growth at this point. Europe is essentially flat, as we've seen for some time now, and the Rest of World varies, with the emerging market regions really growing nicely and the developed regions in a low-growth stage at this point. So overall, maybe a slight improvement in the U.S. but no other notable change from what we reported on our first quarter call.","With respect to our results, we reported 2.5% sales growth, ex PM, for the quarter. This was essentially all internal growth, which came in at 2.7%, and currency was slightly negative. Our internal growth was robust in the U.S., we were up 6.2%; while Europe was positive 1.0%, and that's essentially the same as what we saw in the first quarter; and Rest of World was a positive 0.9%.","We've seen good uptake on new product introductions in the U.S., and our specialty businesses were particularly strong this quarter, confirming to us that these businesses, which are targeted at high-end procedures, can really grow in a reasonable economic environment.","I'd emphasize that we don't really view the U.S. economy as strong at present, maybe it's growing 2%, yet our specialty businesses in total notched double-digit growth for the quarter, and that was led by our implant business. In Europe, I think we're seeing more the same, probably a flat market at best, and we continue to grow, although low single digits. In Rest of World, the reported growth was low this quarter due in part to our decision to discontinue sales to a number of dealers in the Middle East due to increased gray market concerns on our part. Absent the Middle East, our Rest of World number would have been up mid single digits.","On a product category basis, and this is global, our healthcare business and our consumable business both grew mid single digits, while lab and specialty were low single-digits growth for the quarter. And, of course, that was greatly influenced by the slow market in Europe.","With respect to adjusted earnings, we saw good operating margin expansion this quarter. We were up 60 basis points. Again, that's measured on ex precious metal basis despite -- and that's despite the [indiscernible] in the U.S., which is not in the 2012 baseline.","We saw gross margins about flat, excluding the medical excise tax, and we got pretty good leverage on SG&A, including synergies from acquisitions. This and the internal growth drove earnings gains of 6.5% for the quarter to $0.66 per share, and again, that's an adjusted EPS number.","On capital allocation, I'm going to let Chris cover most of this. However, with respect to acquisitions, we do continue to be active evaluating candidates. We had 1 small acquisition and 1 small divestiture in the quarter, and they basically canceled each other out. We continue to look at other properties. However, we're maintaining a disciplined approach in balancing acquisitions with share buybacks and debt reduction goals.","Looking forward, although we feel pretty good about our operational performance in the second quarter, we're balancing this with continued slow market conditions in Europe and additional currency headwinds we are now going to face in the back half of this year. Accordingly, we're going to narrow our guidance for adjusted earnings per share for the full year to the bottom half of our previous range, or $2.33 to $2.38 per share, which implies earnings growth in the back half of 7% to 12%.","Now that concludes my remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim for further discussion of the results. Jim?","James G. Mosch","Thank you, Bret. From an operational perspective, I would like to discuss changes to our U.S. dealer base, comment on Rest of World sales and provide an update on the implant business.","As you may be aware, in 2006, we initiated our U.S. strategic partnership program, in which we consolidated our U.S. dealer base, and within the associated terms of the agreement, we received detailed end user data from the strategic dealer growth. We have found the end user data to be highly effective in developing marketing and promotional programs, directing sales activities and monitoring retail versus wholesale performance. Over time, the dealer base is consolidated, leaving us with a fairly concentrated dealer presence in some regions due to both market consolidation and also as a result of our termination of 1 dealer agreement at the beginning of the second quarter. In Q2, we added a net 5 U.S. dealers to the program to support market and customer coverage requirements. This action restores the number of dealers and balances the coverage to a level we've had when we initiated the program in 2006. In the quarter, we did receive stocking orders from the new dealers, but this was more than offset by the impact of the dealer termination, so it was a slight negative to U.S. growth in the quarter. Going forward, of course, we would expect the expansion to add growth over time as these new dealers become effective.","As Bret mentioned, our Rest of World growth slowed in Q2 to 0.9% versus prior year. As we have discussed on these calls before, on an ongoing basis, we monitor potential gray market activities, which are generally more prevalent in the Rest of World regions. In Q2, we completed an in-depth assessment and identified some questionable dealer activities. As there were circumstances where we could not validate the end user sales, we chose to discontinue sales to certain dealers in the region. The majority of these dealers were in the MEA region, which affects Rest of World sales. While there was an immediate effect in Q2, our experience is that demand remains over time if sales are recovered by the dealers. Beyond the challenges of MEA in this category, we saw good growth in Latin America, CIS, Asia-Pacific and Canada, with slower growth in Japan and Australia.","Turning to the implant segment. DENTSPLY implant saw sales for Q2 only slightly negative on a constant currency basis, which we believe is at or above market. Regionally, we saw U.S. with double-digit growth, clearly above market. As you may remember, the U.S. was our first location to go live in the Astra Tech integration, and we are now capitalizing on the attributes and synergies of the combined implant business.","Europe was down low to mid single digits, driven heavily by continued declines in Southern Europe and lower growth rates in the rest of Europe.","As reported in our last -- in last quarter, our German business performed negatively to prior year in Q1, driven by the go live of the full integration of our German business. They made good progress in Q2 on integration activities with respect to operational consolidation, sales effectiveness and customer transition and improved sequentially over Q1, although still negative. We are pleased with the solid sequential improvement, and we believe we are on the right track, as sales force confidence and execution improves.","Also, in Q2, our Japan business went live as we fully integrated the DENTSPLY implant organization. Japan was our last location to go live, and while the overall organization's effectiveness continues to improve, DENTSPLY implant is essentially moving to a business-as-usual state. From a high level, we are pleased with the progress of the implant business initiatives and that our DENTSPLY implant strategy is sound and will deliver success in the market.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris for some additional financial comments. Chris?","Christopher T. Clark","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to elaborate on our second quarter performance by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also provide some additional color on our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter.","Our sales growth, excluding precious metals, of 2.5% and our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 6.5% for the period reflect some volume improvements in our U.S. businesses, increased leverage on our operating model and also the impact of synergy benefits. Our internal growth rate of 2.7% for the quarter was negatively impacted by about 60 basis points as a result of the discontinuation of sales to certain dealers in the Middle East. Currency translation was negative 20 basis points or essentially neutral to sales growth for the quarter.","Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the second quarter was 58.4% of sales, excluding precious metals, which was a 20-basis-point improvement sequentially from the first quarter and 60 basis points below the strong prior year comparison of 59.0%. We estimate that the medical device excise tax in the United States has negatively impacted gross margins by 40 to 50 basis points in the period compared to prior year. So I'm pleased overall with this performance, which is actually above our trailing 4-quarter average despite not having the tax impact in the half -- over half that baseline.","SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were $280.3 million or 39.2% of sales, excluding precious metals. That's down 6\/10 of 1% compared to the prior year and also down about a full percentage point on a sequential basis compared to Q1.","Expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, were down 120 basis points compared to prior year. While we believe we still have some room for further improvement, we're pleased to see some leverage and synergies across our businesses, including from our ongoing integration efforts.","Operating margin for the quarter was 19.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis compared to 18.6% in the second quarter last year, reflecting the SG&A and gross margin impacts I just described. We're pleased to report the 60-basis-point improvement in our operating margin. I would point out that this is, in fact, our strongest quarterly operating margin rate in the past 10 quarters.","Our reported tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9%, while our operating tax rate was 22.0%, which is consistent with our expectations for the year.","Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the second quarter was $87.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $80.8 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the second quarter 2012. These results include a number of items, which we have listed in the schedules in the release.","On an adjusted basis, earnings were $95.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to $88.5 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the second quarter 2012.","Let me make an additional comment on currency exchange before I move on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Currency rates had a minimal impact on the P&L in the quarter, impacting sales, excluding precious metals, by negative 20 basis points and creating only a very slight headwind in earnings for the period. As we look ahead, based on the current exchange rates, we now believe the currency headwind for the earning -- on earnings for the back half of the year is about $0.04 per share or between $0.05 and $0.06 negative per share for the year -- for the full year. This is about $0.02 per share worse than what we were looking at on our previous call, with the change being primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to a basket of Asia-Pacific and Latin American currencies.","Moving on to cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $97 million, up nicely from $85 million in last year's second quarter. That brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $132 million or 28% increase from the prior year period, despite some investments in working capital during the period.","Inventory now stands at 116 days, which is up 5 days compared to prior year and up 6 days from the end of March, and we've strategically increased inventory as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operational changes in several businesses. We anticipate that inventory may continue to increase slightly for a couple more quarters to support these efforts and then will return in more normal levels as we move through 2014.","Account receivable days were 59 days at the end of June, up 4 days compared to prior year and flat with the level at the end of Q1.","Capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total level -- year-to-date level to $46 million. At this point, we believe our capital spending will be in the $100 million range for the year.","Depreciation in the quarter was $21.3 million, while amortization was $11 million.","Looking at capital deployment. We continue to have a balanced approach that includes internal investments, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, acquisitions and also debt reduction. In the second quarter, we returned $71 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is about 4.5x the prior year level of $15.8 million. We repurchased 1.5 million shares during the second quarter in an average cost of $41.77 per share but still have approximately 13 million shares available for repurchase based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock.","We're also pursuing opportunities on the M&A front, and we're continuing to dialogue and actively engage on specific business opportunities. As Bret mentioned, thus far this year, we competed 1 small acquisition, 1 small divesture, but I would not be surprised to see more acquisitions as we move through the year.","Finally, As Bret stated, our 2013 earnings per share guidance is $2.33 to $2.38 on an adjusted basis, reflecting our assessment of continued above-market performance but also the impacts of additional currency headwinds, continued high dealer inventories and a softer dental implant market in Europe. This guidance reflects a 3.5% adjusted earnings growth in the first half and implies earnings growth acceleration in the range of -- to the range of 7% to 12% for the second half of the year.","That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support, and we'd now be glad to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So Bret, I want to start with you, just on your assessment of Europe and kind of maybe looking for a little more color there. You talked about the market being pretty stable sequentially. It looks like to me, if I just, for selling days, your growth may have come down 100, 150 basis points sequentially or at least softened 100, 150 basis points. So what gives you the confidence market is stable? And if you could provide any more color on maybe how you think some of the southern European countries versus the core European countries could play out over the next couple of quarters, that would be helpful.","Bret W. Wise","Okay. I'll give that a shot. As far as our assessment of the market, it's based on both our own sales volume and then anecdotal comments from the 10 or 12 people we got in the different regions of Europe running those businesses. We haven't seen a notable change in the market environment, our customer acquisition activity, their buying activities. There's still good uptake on new product introductions, but overall, that market is not growing. In fact, the economy is probably contracting, and the market is perhaps stable, maybe some volume growth in some countries, but that's offset by lower volume in other countries. So overall, we haven't seen a notable change to comment on for the most part. As far as regionally, I think that what we said before, it's still contracting in the South, but I would say we're seeing a little bit of stabilization there. It seems to be bottoming out in southern Europe, and northern Europe is kind of a balance between some markets that are growing slightly and some markets that are contracting slightly. So we have a little bit optimism that maybe by '14, some of the markets can begin to grow again, but we don't really anticipate a large improvement at this point in the back half of the year. And I think probably, entering the year, we had some hope that we would see some improvement in the back half. I don't know, Chris or Jim, do you have anything to add to that?","Christopher T. Clark","No, I think that's pretty clear.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And Bret, the mid single-digit decline on the dental implant business in Europe is -- you feel like that's kind of in line with market. Is there anything you can do to maybe try to get above market at this point over the next few quarters? Or should we be thinking kind of that mid single-digit decline continues for the next couple?","Bret W. Wise","Well, I think the mid single-digit decline, and Jim may have something to add to this, is in part due to that German integration. And although we saw a notable improvement in our performance in Q2 versus Q1, I think Jim pointed out, it's still negative. I don't know, Jim, do you have anything to add on the European implant business?","James G. Mosch","Yes, Jeff. I think from our standpoint, we definitely see a situation where our German business continues to improve. France, as an overall market, is doing well. U.K. is doing well. And I think we're seeing some stabilization even in Iberia. Italy tends to still be a little bit challenging. But I think, overall, we're seeing a stabilization, and we do expect some improvement at least from our business perspective in those region -- in that region.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And last question for me, Chris. Just on the Rest of World and the dealers, if you lost about 300 to 500 basis points, it seems like -- as you chose to discontinue some of those EMEA or the MEA dealers, was there an EPS impact from that? Does that flow through to the rest of the year? It looks like to me maybe a couple of pennies. I didn't hear you talk about it when you talked about the reasons for trimming the top end of the guidance range, but to me, it had to have been a $0.01 or $0.02 in your guidance if that's going to continue. So just trying to figure that out.","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, I would -- I guess I would say, Jeff, certainly had an impact in the second quarter. And as we move forward, we do think we'll get a chunk of that business back through other distributors, and some of it, we obviously believe was gray. So we're going to get some of that back in the developed countries, if you will. But that will take -- sometimes, it takes a little bit of time. So yes, there is certainly a little bit of a headwind built in.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Any way to quantify that? Was it $0.01 this quarter, a couple of pennies for the year? Anything?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, you're in the right range. Yes.","Operator","And next, we'll move on Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk or elaborate -- sorry, this is Erin Wilson in for Robert Willoughby. But could you elaborate on the, I guess, trends in the U.S. and how sustainable they are? And this is sort of a run rate, I guess, excluding any sort of changes in selling days and such.","Bret W. Wise","Sure, Erin. I'll take a stab at that. I think our performance in the second quarter was really very strong in the U.S. I mean, it's obvious, I don't think the U.S. market is growing 6%, and we had very strong performance in the specialties, in particular, but also in the consumable business was -- had pretty good growth as well. Whether 6% growth is sustainable over a long period of time or not, I'm not sure. I think that would require the market itself to tick up a little bit from where it is today. But our businesses are executing pretty well, and we're pleased with the uptake we're getting on new products in this market. There's volume growth in this market, which we haven't seen for some period of time. And some of the indicators we follow like white-collar employment gains have been pretty steady here for a while, and I think that's helpful to a business like ours.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then is the integration in Japan, I know you highlighted it in your prepared remarks, but is that going smoothly as initially anticipated?","James G. Mosch","Yes, absolutely. One of our -- we initially integrated the operational portion of this business, with the consolidation of the 2 businesses to 1 facility. That actually happened in the beginning of June. And then the sales force integration happened at the end of June, and that's gone very well. We're very pleased with the way that has occurred.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you have any idea when you can kind of, I guess, regain some of the lost sales due to the gray market distributor in the Middle East?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, Erin, it's Chris. That's going to be gradual. Again, we have other distributors in those regions. We would expect them to pick up obviously a chunk of that initially, but that will probably increase gradually over time. In addition to that, any time we shut off a gray market source, then obviously, that's less product that is getting kind of around our normal distribution channels into the developed markets. So we'd anticipate a gradual increase or a slow impact there as well. I think, again, we'll see it over time. I don't know that it -- it certainly doesn't snap back in a month or necessarily fully in a quarter, but it certainly should come back over time.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Bret, the U.S. specialty market was a really big number, and it seems like it was led by your implant division. Can you talk to the mix shift that you're witnessing in the U.S. dental implant market versus that of what's going on in Europe? And, I guess, in other words, as the delta between the double digit in the U.S. and down mid single digits in Europe, is that all a function of market growth or you're seeing a negative mix shift to lower-end solutions maybe more pronounced in Europe versus what's going on in the U.S.?","James G. Mosch","Yes, John, this is Jim Mosch. From a standpoint of the U.S. market, I mean, clearly, one of the things that we're seeing in the implant business is how the implant business reacts when the economy improves a little bit. And so, obviously, some of the growth we're seeing is an improved market. However, we absolutely believe that as we've consolidated this organization, it's become more productive and more effective that we are seizing customers and we are growing in this market and we are gaining market share. We definitely believe double-digit growth in North America is an increase in market share in the second quarter. As it relates to Europe, we have definitely had some regions that are under duress and have been for a considerable period of time. So we recognize that implants are not an investment that patients are making. We do not see a huge shift from premium to value. And I think one of the things that we always look at is that we do not see a situation in the marketplace where the cost of treatment to the patient is going down, which we think would be a real driver to that change. We definitely recognize that the value implants are out there. They tend to be local. We know they do a lot of swap between each other, and we monitor that closely. But in the premium segment, we do not see major moves to value in our customer group or -- and then, certainly, our largest customers.","Christopher T. Clark","John, it's Chris. I might add that I think the U.S. number kind of underscores that in a reasonable economy. That implant segment really should be accretive and will be accretive to the dental market growth rate. And certainly, what we're seeing in the U.S. and then, obviously, as economic conditions over time improve, I think that has us obviously feeling better in terms of the implant market globally. I would also add, as Jim mentioned, that the U.S. market was the first market that we integrated. So, again, as these integrations go on with time, we get more and more positive momentum, at least that's what we've seen, and obviously, we're pleased with the momentum we have in the U.S., as Jim mentioned.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And it actually sort of plays into the next question, which is, how did Japan go on folding together the sales forces? You mentioned a little disruption in Germany last quarter. I guess, did you witness some disruption in Japan? Or was it seamless? And then when we think about Japan being the last market to consolidate in terms of Astra Tech, what should we think about the incremental savings from here? In other words, are there still some things that you can pull down on as we exit '13 and go into '14?","James G. Mosch","Yes. From a standpoint of the integration in Japan, it went very well. I mean, obviously, you get better over time with experience. The other thing is the Japan business was not nearly the size of, say, Germany or the U.S. So our ability to integrate that seamlessly was very effective. We had a lot of time for those 2 organizations to work together, to get to know each other, to coordinate. And that process, from our perspective, went very, very well, not only from a sales force perspective but also from integration of business systems and things of that nature. So that's gone very well. As far as going forward, certainly, from a standpoint, we recognize synergies from the consolidations that we did. We continue to look for operational synergies as well. And on an going basis, I think there is an element where, as you go through an integration, you have a plan, you execute that plan, you recognize the synergies and then you step back and you take a look at your organization and you say, \"Is this aligned with the way I see the business progressing, those strategy that I have in place and you continue to evaluate that?\" So from a business perspective, this is an ongoing process for us.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And one more if I can just slip it in. Chris, this one for you, just cash flow-related. It looks like CapEx, I think the range used to be $120 million plus. I think you said closer to $100 million this year. Is that just something from a timing perspective of '13 versus '14 or anything that you're pulling back on from a CapEx standpoint?","Christopher T. Clark","Yes, John, it's pretty much just a timing standpoint in terms of we got some initiatives in place, and we really haven't changed the scope of those initiatives but the timing a little bit in terms of phasing on a couple of them.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Matt Pascoe [ph] with William Blair.","Unknown Analyst","I know, obviously, you talked about, in aggregate, Europe is -- continues to be weak, but are there any specific products that you guys see that are surprising you?","Bret W. Wise","Well, I would characterize the market in Europe, the consumable market there, meaning the everyday dentistry products, is better than the specialty businesses, which are highly discretionary and a lot of times not reimbursed. So I would say the preventive products and the restorative products are both doing better. We've had some nice product launches there with -- I mean, I'll just throw out some names here, Prime&Bond Elect, the new cement we have; SmartLite, which is a new light we have; TPH Spectra is a new composite we're putting on the market; Protaper NEXT is a new endodontics file. We're getting good uptake in a lot of these newer products, and -- so that everyday dentistry segment is much more stable than the specialty side of the business, I would say, in Europe.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll move to Yi-Dan Wang with Deutsche Bank.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First of all, on the dental implant business in Germany, is that a recovery more or less in line with what you were expecting? Or is it progressing a bit slower than expected? Certainly, coming out to the last call, I was expecting it to improve or to start to grow in the second quarter. If you could comment on that, and also when you would expect that business to return to growth, that will be helpful. And then secondly, was the implant business affected by the disruptions that you talked about in the gray market in the Middle East? And then, thirdly, can you give us the sort of sales day adjusted growth for the U.S. and ex U.S. implant business? And yes, that will be helpful. That's all.","Bret W. Wise","Okay. Let me take a couple of these, and then I'll let Jim comment on the German business and the progression of the integration. With respect to the Middle East disruption, that was not implants, that was basic consumable products. Sales adjusted basis, we don't adjust our sales for the days, but if you want to adjust them yourself, you can. I think there was an extra day in the U.S., an extra day in Germany. We were down a day in Sweden. Overall...","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. About 60% of our business had an extra day.","Bret W. Wise","Okay. So about 0.6 of a day for the global business was extra this quarter versus last year. With respect to the implant business in Germany and progression of the integration, Jim, do you want to take that?","James G. Mosch","Absolutely, Bret. From a standpoint of the integration in Germany, I think it's important to recognize that this was, by far, our largest and most complex integration. This is a very large sales force, fairly equally divided between Astra Tech and Friadent organizations. So there was a fair amount of customer transition. They're also moving to a common operating system, common processes, and there's just an element of the business gains confidence and effectiveness over time. We certainly would have hoped that the integration would have gone smoother in the first quarter. We saw a nice improvement in Q2, and we've seen improvement in July. So from my perspective, I see the confidence and effectiveness of this organization improve every month, and we expect it to continue to perform better each month as we go forward. As far as the overall market, the German market is probably, I think, a little bit more challenging than us and our competitors would have anticipated. So that recovery aspect is happening in a market that probably has a little bit of slower growth as well. But I think, over time, as we move through the next couple of quarters, we expect to see some good improvement in that market and that business.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When you say improvements in the next couple of quarters, can we expect it to grow by that time or it's kind of a relative gain in that if the market is becoming more challenging, then you're going against decent headwinds?","Bret W. Wise","Yes, Yi-Dan, we don't really give specific guidance on specific products in specific markets, but we're happy to see that the business is improving sequentially. We expect that to continue. Predicting how 1 market in 1 country around the world is going to progress is a dangerous business, and we don't believe we need to do that. But we're happy with the business. It's progressed nicely from what happened in the first quarter, and we expect to see sequential improvement from here.","Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then last question. On the regional growth in the implant business, can you be a bit more precise on your U.S. and ex U.S. growth? I mean, double digit sounds wonderful. Can you give us some indication on where you are along those lines, whether it's low double-digit, mid-teens, high-teens, and then similarly for the ex U.S. business?","Bret W. Wise","It's low double digits in the U.S., and it's negative in Europe.","Operator","And we'll move on to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Bret, curious if you would elaborate on what drove the decision to change the dealer setup in the U.S. market, and if you could quantify the impact to the U.S. growth rate in the second quarter. And then how should we think about that dynamic in the back half of the year?","Bret W. Wise","Okay, Bran, I'll take a stab at this and then if Jim or Chris want to add anything they can. When we -- right after we had done the dealer consolidation, it was late 2006, 2007. We had basically 22 dealers that were strategically picked for coverage in the market and also the way that they transact business with us, meaning they were the most sophisticated and the easiest business partners for us to do business with. They were very efficient, et cetera. Since that time, there has been consolidation of 5 of those dealers. So about 25% of the baseline went away through consolidation, and then in the second quarter -- early in the second quarter, we terminated one of the remaining. It was 17 dealers at that point, so we were down to 16 dealers. We felt that was a little bit too consolidated, so we made the decision to go back out and find 5 or 6 other dealers that we thought would rebalance the portfolio and get us back to kind of a number around 20, 22 dealers to cover all of the U.S., which we think is about the right balance for us. So just -- we expect that there can be industry consolidation, so when we consolidated -- when we brought the dealer -- the number of dealers down before, we knew this might happen. And over the 6 or 7 years since we implemented the program, we had lost 25% of the dealers to consolidation, so we rebalanced the portfolio. This is simply what happened. The effect on the second quarter was that the initial orders from the new dealers to bring their -- put their inventory in was slightly less than the sales we lost to the dealer we cut off. So it was slightly negative to the U.S. growth rate in the quarter. As those dealers become now efficient in areas of the market that maybe we were underrepresented in before, we expect it, of course, to be positive to the balance of the business and the growth of the business.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then, Chris, any chance you could quantify the impact of absorption on the gross margin line in the second quarter? And certainly, it sounds like that should trend favorably in the back half of the year as you build inventories. And then, perhaps, if you could call out the impact of mix and currency on the gross margin line in the quarter, that would be helpful.","Christopher T. Clark","Sure. Let me start with -- the currency really didn't have much of an impact in the quarter. There's some gives and takes between translation and transaction. From a mix standpoint, mix was slightly negative, with obviously a little bit slower implant growth and also a little bit negative product mix. I would characterize that probably in the -- it was -- appear to be in the -- about the 30-basis-point range. Again, the biggest negative impact for us -- impact in general for us on the gross profit line was the med device excise tax, which was between 40 and 50 basis points of headwind. In terms of absorption, we got a little bit of a lift in absorption but not significant as necessarily in a quarter. As we move forward, I would assume that the inventory level [indiscernible] come up a bit but probably not come up to the degree as much incrementally as they have here in the first -- in the second quarter, at least that would be our expectation. But I don't necessarily see them coming down as rapidly in the back half as historically we have. So I would characterize it probably that way.","Bret W. Wise","Yes. The only thing I might add there, Brandon, is on the currency impact, although it was somewhat neutral in the second quarter, we saw some pretty significant weakening of both emerging markets and some developed markets against the U.S. dollar and the euro. And the reason that's important is, in those markets, we typically buy the inventory in from the U.S. or Europe, and thus, we had a little bit of a headwind -- or more of a headwind than we had when we finished the first quarter with respect to some of those currencies. I don't know, Chris...","Christopher T. Clark","Yes. Absolutely. I mean, if you look at it in the quarter, against the Australian dollar, the U.S. dollar strengthened 11%, similar movement against the Brazilian real, similar movement against the Indian rupee. I mean, some of these are smaller organizations force, but there's a lot of them that add up. And, again, as Bret mentioned, these folks are net importers of products, both from U.S. and from Europe in terms of our products. And so as such, as their home currencies weaken, those foreign-sourced products become more expensive for them. And so, obviously, their profits obviously translate to fewer U.S. dollars as well.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Diego Hernandez","It's actually Diego filling in for Glen. I was just wondering if we could get a quick update on sort of the ortho relaunch. I think where we left it last quarter, the things were tracking well in line with your expectations. Any color around that would be helpful.","Bret W. Wise","Yes. I think we're pretty much -- very much still in line, Diego, relative to what we expected. I would say we kind of characterize it as saying this next phase was going to be a street fight slugging it out, really, customer by customer with competition. I think that ortho Japan together really didn't have a meaningful impact necessarily on our overall growth for the quarter or internal growth for the quarter. We saw some solid customer gains, particularly in the U.S., in the quarter. So we feel good about that. But, again, I think that we're now beginning to run up against kind of the prior year relaunch. We kind of ran up against it in the second quarter in Europe, and now we're going to begin running up against that in the U.S. in terms of some baselines that had customer restocking efforts in it. So -- but, again, the way we're really measuring this is at a customer level in terms of, again, that street fight, and we're pleased with how our teams are doing, particularly in the U.S. right now.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Leckow for any additional or closing remarks.","Derek W. Leckow","Well, thank you. Thanks for your interest in DENTSPLY, and thanks for your participation today. That concludes our conference call. If you have any questions, I'm around today for any follow-ups. Thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation."]}}
