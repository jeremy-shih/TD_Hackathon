All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Joseph Wolk","Good morning. I'm Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to our review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. ","Also on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with our 2016 results as they demonstrate our track record of consistent and sustainable growth, exceeding financial expectations, and making progress on our long-term strategic drivers such as advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline, implementing new commercial models in our Medical Device segment and enhancing market leadership for many of our iconic consumer brands.","As we enter 2017, we are confident in our ability to continue producing solid results, while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, caregivers and customers. ","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com where you can also find additional materials including today\u2019s presentation and accompanying schedules. ","In terms of the agenda for today\u2019s discussion, after I review results for the Corporation and the three business segments, Alex will comment on our 2016 performance, share his perspectives on current dynamics in the healthcare and discuss key growth drivers for the company. ","Dominic will then provide remarks on the income statement, and insights on our guidance for 2017. The remaining time will be available to answer your questions. We anticipate the call will last about 90 minutes. ","Before we begin, please be aware that some of the statements made today during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Investor Relations section on our website for the Company\u2019s SEC filings, in particular, our 10-K that identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.","We will also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are not replacement for GAAP financial measures. Again, please refer to our press release and website for tables reconciling non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures. ","A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.","Now, on to our results for the fourth quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales were $18.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, up 1.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 2.3% as currency had a negative impact of 0.6%. In the U.S., sales were up 2.6%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 1.9% as the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported OUS results by 1.3 points. ","You may remember that during last year\u2019s fourth quarter call, we informed you that our 2015 fiscal year included an additional week resulting in a few additional shipping days. Calculated of the 2015 base, these additional days negatively impacted growth in the fourth quarter 2016 by 480 basis points and the full year 2016 by 130 basis points. ","Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C, Venezuela and the additional shipping days in 2015 operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, 9.5% in the US and 5.6$ outside the US. I will provide you the same reference for each segment.","For the full year 2016, consolidated sales were $71.9 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to the same period a year ago. Operationally, full year sales grew 3.9% with currency having a negative impact of 1.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C, Venezuela and the additional shipping days in 2015, operational sales growth was 7.4% worldwide, 8.9% in the US, and 5.7% outside the US.","Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.38, versus $1.15 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.58 representing increases of 7.9% and 9.7% respectively compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10.4%.","Regarding the full year, 2016 net earnings were $16.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.93. 2016 adjusted net earnings were $18.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $6.73, up 7.6% and 8.5% respectively versus full year 2015 results.","On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9.4%. Please note, with respect to the extra days in 2015, as we stated last year, we did incur additional operating costs and as such the bottom-line impact was negligible. Dominic will provide further detail regarding earnings in his remarks.","Beginning with Consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly business segment sales performance. Highlighting items that build upon the slide you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent operational sales changes in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.","While now part of the prepared remarks for today\u2019s call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for full year 2016 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. ","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.4 billion growing 4.9%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, Venezuela, and the 2015additional shipping days adjusted sales growth was 7.6% worldwide. Operational growth was driven by global Beauty and OTC. Despite global consumer categories slowdown, we did continue to see strong consumptions for many of our products. ","The Beauty franchise previously reported as Skin Care, includes the acquisitions of Vogue, NeoStrata and La Lumiere Light Mask, which in total contributed sales of $105 million or 12 points of growth for the franchise. The NEUTROGENA brand grew approximately 20% in the US. Also in the US, higher levels of retail stocking occurred in the quarter as we introduced new products and our Beauty products continued to gain share accounting for approximately eight points of growth.","The OTC market growth rate was down [Audio Gap] and TYLENOL and ZYRTEC brands continue to gain market share. Analgesic adult share is currently 14.3%, and pediatric share is 49.8%, up approximately 1 point and 4 points respectively from Q4 2015. You may remember, in our third quarter call, we commented on lower inventory levels impacting growth, which we felt was temporary given our share gains. ","In the fourth quarter, we did see a replenishment of that inventory to match the higher demand, as well as some seasonal build. This represented approximately eight points in the US OTC growth rate for the quarter. It is worth noting that the impact of demonetization in India and Article Regulation 94 regulation in China collectively represented a negative impact of approximately $50 million or 150 basis points on worldwide consumer growth. The impact from demonetization mostly impacted the Babycare franchise, while Article 94 primarily impacted the OTC business. ","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion grew 2.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C, Venezuela and the 2015 additional shipping days, adjusted sales growth was 9.9% worldwide. Oncology and Immunology were the primary contributors to operational growth. ","In Oncology, DARZALEX continued its strong growth trajectory with $200 million in sales for the quarter and in its first full year on the market reached sales of $572 million. DARZALEX maintains its leadership in line for multiple myeloma and we are seeing early signs of strong adoption for lines two and three following the recent approvals. ","IMBRUVICA in the US across all lines of therapy gained approximately seven points of market share and the CLO market based on third quarter data is estimated to have grown better than 20%. Outside the US, we are seeing strong penetration in the G5 countries. ","Worldwide ZYTIGA growth was down versus the fourth quarter of 2015 due to competition in the EMEA region as well as the higher utilization of patient assistance foundations in the US. ","In Immunology, the US market is estimated to have grown approximately 11%. STELARA in the US gained 3.6 points of market share in psoriasis versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and during the quarter, we received approval for the Crohn's disease indication in the EU to add to the US approval we\u2019ve received in September. ","SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA benefitted in quarterly year-on-year comparisons by approximately four points from an inventory burn that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. REMICADE export business continues to see the impact of biosimilar competition. Regarding the at-risk biosimilar launch of Inflectra in the US, we have not observed any significant impact to-date.","I\u2019ll conclude the pharmaceutical segment by commenting to some other key brands. INVOKANA, INVOKAMET sales were flat worldwide driven by continued uptake outside the US and modest declines in US share. XARELTO growth was driven by continued total prescription market share gains with the US now at 18%, up nearly two points from a year ago.","Warfarin still makes up 53% of the market, but that is down from 61% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our long-acting injectable portfolio achieved strong results in all major regions due to increasing market share. ","I\u2019ll now review the Medical Device segment results. Worldwide Medical Device sales were $6.4 billion growing 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, Venezuela and the 2015 additional shipping days, adjusted sales growth was 4.7% worldwide. Operational growth was driven by our priority platforms, which as a reminder Electrophysiology, Endocutters, Energy, Knees and Trauma, combined, that set of businesses grew approximately 4% when you adjust for the additional shipping days in Q4 2015, our priority platforms grew approximately 8%","Electrophysiology grew 10% worldwide, as atrial fibrillation procedures are estimated to have grown 15% in the US and we see strong adoption of our newer OUS product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters. This business has grown double-digits 28 out of the last 29 quarters. ","Within the Advanced Surgery category, Endocutters growth was primarily driven by an uptake of new products in Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, specifically China and Japan. The Energy business benefited in quarterly year-on-year comparisons by approximately 7 points due to the business disruption we experienced on our HARMONIC ACE 7 Plus shares in Q4 2015. ","Within Orthopedics, Knee growth was driven by continued uptake of ATTUNE outside the US. ATTUNE continues to gain volume in the US. Trauma, which now includes sales from the acquisition of Biomedical grew due to the TFNA mailing system uptake and the US market increasing approximately 5% based on our estimates. ","Pricing pressure continued across the major categories in Orthopedics, but was partially offset by favorable mix. We are routinely asked in this forum about net price, so let me provide that to you now. For the quarter, net price in hips was negative 2.4%, knees negative 2%, trauma positive 3.2% and spine positive 2%. ","Lastly, within the Medical Device segment, strong Vision Care results were driven by the introduction of new products such as ACUVUE VITA, and new offerings in the Beauty Lens category, as well as a trade inventory build, which accounted for approximately 3 points of growth. ","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2016. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the fourth quarter. It is now pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the line today. We are really pleased to be here sharing the strong results we delivered for 2016, not only do we meet our financial commitments to our investors and shareholders, we also delivered on the commitments and responsibilities defined in our Credo. ","As all of you know, we have several important responsibilities outlined in our Credo. It compels us to meet our first responsibility to the doctors and nurses, mothers and fathers, and all others to use our products; to our employees, to our communities, in the world we live in, and it compels us to make a sound profit, experiment with new ideas and develop innovative programs. When we do all of this, our shareholders should realize a fair return. ","In fact, we delivered a very fair return this year. Our total shareholder return for 2016 was a strong 15.3%, significantly exceeding our competitor composites as well as exceeding most major indices. And not only is that true for 2016, but I am very proud to say it\u2019s also the case over the last three, five, ten and twenty year periods. ","Our strong shareholder return for 2016 is indicative of the strength of the businesses and the improved strategic focus and execution that our leaders and teams have delivered over the past several years. Our Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver strong growth while also increasing investments to further develop our incredibly strong pipeline of innovative new medicines. ","Our Medical Device business refocused and accelerated our pace of innovation and develop novel commercial models to meet the evolving needs of today\u2019s healthcare system and our Consumer business continued gaining share across most of our major categories and significantly improved margins with a goal of returning to benchmark profitability. ","Our strong record of total shareholder returns is the result of our approach to managing for the long-term, our relentless drive for innovation, our disciplined portfolio management and our capital allocation strategy, all of which are regularly discussed as part of our ongoing strategic planning with our Board of Directors. ","We believe the sustaining investments and innovation is the most important aspect of our strategy. In 2016, we invested more than $9 billion in R&D and submitted 250 NDAs, DLAs, TMAs, 510 (NYSE:K)s, and CE marks for approval and received 243 product approvals in major markets in addition to a number of new product launches in our Consumer businesses.","We expect to continue this rate of investment and accelerate our submissions and approvals in the future. Now another important part of that strategy is value-creating acquisitions and collaborations. In the last year, we closed several acquisitions of significant size including Vogue International in the Consumer Beauty space, and we look forward to closing on our acquisition of Abbott Medical Optics in the Vision Care space during the first quarter.","In total, we completed 13 acquisitions and license of various size, 67 innovation deals and made 21 new investments from our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation during 2016. And as we previously announced, we are currently in exclusive negotiations with Actelion for a potential transaction. While we won\u2019t be commenting any further on that today, regardless of whether an agreement is reached with Actelion we will continue to look for additional opportunities to create value for our shareholders.","As our portfolio evolves through acquisitions like these, we are also constantly evaluating each of our existing businesses to determine whether they continue to fit our criteria for value creation. As a result from time-to-time, it makes sense to undertake a process to consider whether a different operating structure or a different ownership for our business might be value enhancing or whether a business might be a better fit in another company\u2019s portfolio. This process also ensures that we continuing to invest in the most promising areas of our portfolio where we believe we can make a significant difference for patients and consumers and create greater value for our shareholders. ","In 2016, we divested eight businesses from our portfolio, the most significant being the divestiture of our Noramco business in Pharmaceuticals. As you saw in our release this morning, we are currently evaluating strategic options for our Consumer and Medical Device, Diabetes franchise including LifeScan, Animas, and Calibra. ","We are assessing a wide range of options including strategic partnerships and joint ventures and have not set a definitive timeline to complete this review. I\u2019d also note that there is no guarantee that this process will result in any transaction. As we undertake this review, we remain focused on best positioning these businesses in their respective markets and meeting the changing needs of our customers and patients. ","Given our broad base in human healthcare, Johnson & Johnson remains fully committed to the prevention and detection of diabetes and will continue to serve those impacted by diabetes through innovative products, services and solutions from our Medical Device, Pharmaceuticals and Health and Wellness businesses. ","This includes important leadership and innovation in areas such as bariatric surgery and through medicines such as INVOKANA, and INVOKAMET. We will continue investing in this important area across all of our business segments. All of this is consistent with our capital allocation priorities which we discussed before. ","After funding our internal growth initiatives, our estimated free cash flow for 2016 was $15.5 billion. Our first priority for that cash is delivering a competitive dividend to our shareholders and in 2016, we paid $8.6 billion in dividends which have increased for 54 consecutive years. After meeting our dividend goals, we target value-creating acquisitions with $5 billion invested in M&A and major licensing deals this year.","And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as share repurchase programs. As you know, we completed the majority of our $10 billion share repurchase program in 2016. Historically, approximately 70% of our free cash flow deployed over the last ten years has been returned to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases. ","As the world\u2019s largest, the most broadly based healthcare company, we understand the important role we play in leading responsibly and representing our industry with integrity. Our industry has a track record of producing advancements in healthcare that saves and improves people\u2019s lives and people depend on us to continue making new discoveries. ","As I think back on how far we\u2019ve come, the investments we\u2019ve made in innovation and healthcare have yielded some amazing returns. The average life expectancy continues to rise and diseases such as HIV that were considered as death sentence are now treatable. Surgeries that once required extended hospital stays now can be done through an outpatient procedure. ","Cures in treatments reaching the market today are not only improving quality of life for many patients, extending life for others and contributing to the productivity of our society, but they are also helping to reduce caregiver burden, disability, and healthcare spending in other parts of the system such as hospitalization. ","Healthcare affects each one of us in a deeply personal way, whether it\u2019s our own health or the health of the loved ones, but it also accounts for 18% of our GDP. Pharmaceutical spending is one component accounts for about 14% of the overall healthcare spending in the US. Considering that, I think it\u2019s important to be clear on how we view our responsibility to the patients and stakeholders impacted by our products.","We believe that investing in innovation to create differentiated products should ultimately help people live longer, healthier and happier lives is our first responsibility. Our process to then set the prices for those products includes extensive research and collecting diverse stakeholder inputs in order to ensure that they are both assessable and representative of the outcomes and value they ultimately deliver.","We have maintained a responsible approach to pharmaceutical pricing, generally limiting aggregate annual price increases to single-digit percentages below those of our competitive sets. Furthermore, in our Pharmaceutical business, we invest more in R&D than we do in sales and marketing and cumulatively since 2010, we have invested more incremental dollars in R&D than we have realized from US net price increases.","Moving forward, we plan to take the next step in our prime legacy of leadership in transparency and responsible pricing. Later this quarter, we will consolidate and expand upon our disclosures with the release of our first US Pharmaceutical Transparency Report. This annual report will highlight existing disclosures of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s clinical trial data and compassionate use, as well as Janssen\u2019s transfer of value to US healthcare providers in support for patient access. ","Additionally, it will include expand the disclosures on US pricing and value, as well as R&D and sales and marketing expenses. We recognize that this is one step towards demonstrating how serious we are about responsible pricing. In the long-term, we know it will take all parts of the healthcare system working together to address the challenges we are facing. ","We look forward to continuing our work with government officials, our customers and other stakeholders to ensure we are doing our part to provide differentiated, value-based and affordable healthcare to people around the world. We also recognize we are uniquely positioned to provide leadership on the health and wellness issues that we understand better than anyone else.","We know many of you may be curious or anxious about the impact of various changes both here in the US and globally that could impact our business. As you may know, yesterday I had the honor of meeting with the President and the new administrations and we had a productive conversation about accelerating growth in jobs in the United States. We look forward to continuing that dialogue and while it\u2019s still too early to speculate about the impact of changes to existing US health policy or potential changes to the US tax codes, I\u2019d like to provide our perspective about the changes we will advocate for and hope to see in the near future. ","First, in regards to healthcare reform, we are glad that healthcare has been and continues to be a significant part of the dialogue in Washington, as well as around the world. We look forward to continuing to work with lawmakers and politicians on both sides of the aisle to find solutions that improves the health of our society. And in fact, we were very pleased with the Bipartisan support and ultimate passing of the 21st Century Cures Act in late 2016. This legislation was a significant investment in innovation signaling its importance to all stakeholders. We hope lawmakers take the same cooperative spirit putting patients first as we move through debate about the future of our healthcare system.","Now why we won\u2019t speculated about what may be included in potential new healthcare legislation in the US, I would like to offer a summary of the components that we are encouraging lawmakers to consider in any new or reformed healthcare law. First, we are advocating for important elements like increased access, coverage of pre-existing conditions and coverage of young people on their parents\u2019 health plan to continue in the future.","Second, we believe that any ACA replacement must support a competitive market for individual health insurance. We will continue to advocate for models that encourage innovation and value, continuing the move towards value-based care and payment for improved patient outcomes.","Finally, we support reforms and emphasize wellness and intercepting disease before it happens, preventive care, more latitude for employer wellness programs and incentives for healthy behaviors are great ways to embody this focus. Outside the US, healthcare systems are evolving as well and we will continue to be a champion for improving patient outcomes and investing in healthy societies.","We know that when governments invest in healthcare, they see a return on that investment in the form of worker productivity, economic growth and stability. In addition to advocating for all these healthcare priorities as a US-based multinational company, we also are advocating for the modernization of the US tax codes. As both sides in the aisle in the Washington have noted, the US tax code for business is outdated and in many cases makes the US a more costly place to do business leaving US workers and the US economy at a disadvantage. ","We are very encouraged by the proposals currently in discussion and we will support business tax policy that is competitive with most developed countries and encourages innovation and growth. This includes a system based on territorial taxation in line with most economically developed nations. ","We also believe that there should be incentives for innovations such as research and development and the cash currently held abroad should be allowed to be brought back into the US at a more competitive tax rate. Regardless of the outcome of these discussions, we will continue to engage with global leaders and continue to be a leading voice advocating for the stakeholders in our Credo.","As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, so too does our business. But despite these changing dynamics at an enterprise level, we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives. As we have said many times, our objective is to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market and grow our earnings faster than sales. ","That, coupled with value-creating M&A and our strong dividend yields is the basis for our strong long-term total shareholder return. In the near term, we are focused on meeting our financial and quality commitments. In terms of financial performance, we expect each of our three business segments to grow and contribute to our sales and income growth in 2017. And in keeping with our Credo commitment that everything we do must be of high quality. In 2016 we continued to elevate our quality standards with measurable progress. ","In our Pharmaceutical business, our priority is to drive continued growth while delivering on our near-term pipeline. We will do this by focusing on our five therapeutic areas of high unmet medical needs, our robust innovation engine and strong commercial capabilities. ","For 2017, we expect our key catalyst for growth will include, continued strong performance of our in line products, increasing penetration in markets such as anti-coagulants, psoriasis and long-acting anti-psychotics. Capitalizing on the early launch success from key products such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and STELARA for Crohn\u2019s diseases, an anticipated regulatory approval for two new immunology products, guselkumab and sirukumab, each with greater than $1 billion of sales potential. ","Further, we will continue to vigorously defend our patents on REMICADE while remaining competitive against at-risk biosimilar entries given our long track record of efficacy and safety. For those of you following our remarks on the webcast, you can see the many key events we have highlighted in our Pharmaceutical pipeline for 2017 including the potential approval of several line extensions, planned regulatory submissions in both the US and EU, as well as the presentation of key clinical data. ","We are confident our industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline and will continue working toward our goal of filing ten new products by 2019 each with at least $1 billion of potential sales as well as filing an additional 40 line extensions by 2019, ten of which have more than $500 million in potential sales. ","Our near-term priority in Medical Devices is to accelerate growth through innovation, portfolio management and new business models. We are driving growth in priority platforms, sustaining leadership in our core platforms, implementing novel commercial models and seeking expansion opportunities in large growing markets with significant unmet needs.","Our goal is to return to above market growth by the second half of this year and we\u2019ve planned to drive that growth through, continued progress on the restructuring initiatives in our hospital medical device businesses, which I\u2019ll remind everyone is on track to achieve savings of $800 million to $1 billion with the majority realized by 2018; more than doubling the number of new product launches in 2016 with more than 12 major launches, accelerating the impact from strategic acquisitions made in 2016 including BME in the foot and ankle space, our new expandable cage from interventional spine, Coherence Medical in the atrial fibrillation space and NeuWave Medical and Energy and as I mentioned, we plan to close the acquisition of AMO this quarter.","And finally, incorporating a suite of holistic insights-driven capabilities to help health systems navigate value-based care to the care advantage in orthopedic episode of care partnerships which we announced earlier this month. ","And in our Consumer segment, in the near term, our priority is to enhance our leadership in priority categories and continue to improve profitability to benchmark levels by focusing on critical geographies and iconic mega brands. Our plans for Consumer growth in 2017 includes, continuing to grow faster than the market and gaining market share across our mega brands, bringing innovation to the market and launching key science-based new products, accelerating the growth from recent acquisitions in our Beauty franchise including Vogue International, Light Therapy in our NEUTROGENA business and NeoStrata in dermocosmetics. ","And finally, we will continue to utilize supply chain and SG&A efficiencies to ensure operating margins are at benchmark levels. All of these compelling strategies and strong results would not be possible without our talented, diverse and dedicated employees around the world. ","Today, we employ approximately 127,000 global employees with approximately 40,000 jobs here in the US. Our purpose-driven, Credo-based culture puts people first and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees. We believe employers have an opportunity and responsibility as well as an incentive to ensure their employers are healthy and engaged.","Our goal is to lead by example by cultivating the world\u2019s healthiest workforce from programs that encourage healthy eating, movement and resilience to ensuring the financial health of our employees through competitive compensation programs, as well as providing important benefits to support healthy families. ","We believe these programs help us to achieve our goals of attracting developing and retaining the very best talents deliver the best outcomes, positioning us to deliver another 130 years of strong growth and shareholder return. ","In total, we are proud of the results we\u2019ve delivered over the past several years and we will continue working to achieve and exceed your expectations for us in 2017 and beyond. I am very confident that with our robust pipelines and investments in innovation, our improved efficiency and productivity, and value-driven leaders and employees united by our Credo, we will continue to deliver strong and consistent growth. ","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Dominic who will provide additional details about our results and guidance for 2017. ","Dominic Caruso","Thanks, Alex and good morning, everyone. We understand that there has been some audio difficulties this morning and we apologize for that and hopefully that issue is now been resolved. As you\u2019ve heard from Alex, we are very pleased with our 2016 performance. We believe we managed our business well and that we have transparently shared information to help you understand our plans and expectations. ","We ended the year at the top end of our most recent operational guidance range for sales and the negative impact of currency resulted in sales slightly below consensus on a reported basis. With respected to adjusted earnings, we also finished above our operational guidance and at the high end of our reported EPS guidance despite the negative impact of currency and exceeded consensus estimates for earnings as published by FirstCall. ","Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year 2016. On a reported sales basis, $71.9 billion represented an increase of 2.6%, which on an operational or constant currency basis grew 3.9%. As we told you this time we expected to accelerate our underlying growth from 2015 and 2016 excluding any impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales, and the impact of Venezuela, as well as the additional shipping days in 2015 which we previously discussed. ","On that basis, we grew sales in 2015 at 5.5%. We have exceeded that level of growth for full year 2016 at 7.4%. Our earnings, adjusted operational EPS growth and our 2016 guidance was expected to range between 5.3% and 7.7%. As reported this morning, our EPS was $6.73 reflects reported growth of 8.5% and operational growth of 9.4% exceeding both our original guidance and the updated guidance range we gave in October, driven by significant improvement in our adjusted pretax operating margins. ","Our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis point increase in our 2016 adjusted pretax operating margin. For full year 2016, we exceeded our projections achieving a 330 basis improvement while continuing to invest in our business. As you may remember, when we provided guidance this time last year, 2015\u2019s earnings had been impacted by significant divestiture gains. ","As we told you at the time, not all of those gains were reflected in income, most were used to reinvest in our business, which lowered our pretax operating margin for 2015. So naturally, in 2016, without that impact, our margins improved and in addition, through margin improvement programs in our supply chain, our consumer business and our enterprise standards and productivity initiatives, we were able to further exceed our guidance. These factors have resulted in very strong adjusted pretax operating margins for the enterprise. ","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016. On a reported sales for the fourth quarter basis, they grew at 1.7%, that represents 2.3% on an operational basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hep C sales, and the impact of Venezuela as well as the impact in the quarter associated with the extra shipping days, our 2014 fourth quarter operational growth was a strong 7.6%. ","Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4.4 billion in the quarter, up 7.9% compared to fourth quarter 2015 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 versus $1.58 a year ago or up 9.7% and adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analysts\u2019 estimates as published by FirstCall. ","Excluding the net impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted EPS was $1.59 and up a strong 10.4% for the fourth quarter. In the quarter we incurred intangible amortization expense of $252 million on an after-tax basis and after-tax special charges of $295 million, which included cost of approximately $251 million related to the restructuring that we previously announced of our Medical Device business. ","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 130 basis points lower than the same period last year due to cost improvement programs, selling marketing and administrative expenses were 29.3% of sales. This is a 380 basis point improvement from last year as we saw the benefits of many of the programs designed to lower the level of certain costs, but we continued to invest to drive growth in our key brands. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 14.6% in the quarter and 150 basis points lower than the prior year, this is mostly due to the timing of milestone payments.","Interest expense net of interest income was lower reflecting higher earnings on our investments. Other income and expense was a net loss of $20 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $1.2 billion in the same period last year. Of course, this is a line item that includes several special items in both years.","Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million in 2016 compared to a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion in the prior year period. Total gain for the year was lower than our guidance as not all of our planned activities were executed in 2016, which I will discuss further in my guidance for 2017.","The adjusted fourth quarter effective tax rate for 2016 was 14.5%. This lower tax rate offsets the impact of currency on the quarter and the lower than other expected other income. The adjusted full year effective tax rate for 2016 was 17.6%, which was slightly below our guidance due to the mix of our business within our international affiliates.","It was also lower than prior year also due to mix of business and the adoption of a new accounting standard in the second quarter of 2016 related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation.","Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Full year 2016 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved from 31.4% of sales in 2015 to 31.7% of sales in 2016. ","Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, Medical Devices at 32.2% is lower than the previous year primarily due to the Cordis gain which we recorded in 2015. Pharmaceutical margins were flat but still remains significantly above their benchmarks. Consumer margins improved by 560 basis points versus 2015 approaching benchmark levels, while still making important investments for future growth as we return our iconic Consumer brand for the market.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2017. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I\u2019ll give you some guidance on items we know maybe difficult for you to forecast. I\u2019d like to first address our cash position. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $15 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt. ","As Alex said earlier, regardless of the any potential transaction with Actelion, we are always looking for the right opportunities to deploy that capital to create greater value for our shareholders and due to our strong balance sheet, we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute on all of our capital allocation priorities simultaneously.","Also as Alex noted, we have now completed approximately 75% of our $10 billion share repurchase program. We expect to complete the program during the first half of 2017. Although we are continuing to evaluate external value-creating opportunities in line with our capital allocation priorities, for purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions, or other major uses of cash except for the completion of our share repurchase program, we suggest you consider modeling 2017 net interest expense of $500 million to $600 million. Regarding other income and expense, which is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from litigation investment for the development corp, as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs, we would be comfortable with your models for 2017 reflecting other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This is a higher level than 2016 as certain activities were not completed in 2016 as expected.","As we move forward, a portion of any gains will be reinvested in the business as we have done in previous years. In regards to adjusted pre-tax operating margins, because we did not have the same level of divestitures in 2016 as in 2015 and subsequently did not have the additional investments in our business, we delivered significant improvement in 2016 while we wouldn\u2019t expect the same level of improvement in our pre-tax, adjusted pre-tax operating margins in 2017, not including any impact of acquisition divestitures, we would expect to maintain to slightly improve our adjusted pre-tax operating margins in 2017 as we continue with the key margin improvement initiatives in our business. ","And now, a word on taxes. While we remain optimistic about the US corporate tax reform proposals, our guidance today does not include any assumptions about the current proposal. At this time, we would suggest that your models reflect an effective tax rate in 2017 excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%. ","Now, turning to guidance on sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2017 includes the impact of Abbott Medical Optics which we expect will close before the end of the first quarter as well as REMICADE, the impact of any REMICADE biosimilars which we consider to be at risk due to the ongoing patent litigation as we have previously discussed. ","However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PROCRIT TREVICTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results of operations. This is the way we managed our business and it reflects the underlying performance of our business. ","We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2017 with the impact that exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. For full year 2017, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of 4% to 5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2017 on a constant currency basis of approximately $74.8 billion to $75.5 billion.","Our operational sales guidance for 2015 on an underlying basis excluding any acquisitions and divestitures is expected to reflect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro at $1.07, our guidance for sales growth would decrease by approximately 1%, of course we will update this estimate as we progress through the year. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 3% to 4% or total expected level of reported sales of approximately $74.1to $74.8 billion.","And now turning to earnings, a continuing factor in our earnings guidance for 2017 is the impact of the currency movements on transactions which although hedged are still expected to be negative. We expect transaction currency impacts to negatively impact our gross margin by approximately 20 to 30 basis points in 2017 as compared to 2016. We will be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.05 to $7.20 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 5% to 7%. ","Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at $1.07 our reported adjusted EPS will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.93 to $7.08 per share and at this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.","As we look at the published models that support the consensus EPS estimates currently, it appears that many of those models have not yet been updated for the negative impact of currency movements. ","So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I would like to make a few key points. We expect our operational sales growth to range between 4% and 5% and our underlying growth, which excludes any impact of acquisition, divestitures to be approximately 3% to 3.5%. ","With regards to expected EPS growth, on an operational constant currency adjusted basis, our guidance is strong in the range of 5% to 7% consistent with our objectives to grow earnings faster than sales on a constant currency basis. ","Also for 2017, we expect to maintain or slightly improve on our adjusted pre-tax operating margins based on the guidance I just provided. ","As we move into 2017, we are confident in the strength of our business. As we execute on our growth plans and near-term priorities that Alex laid out to you this morning we are well positioned with the strong balance to deliver solid results while continuing to invest in innovation, which will ensure our future growth and success.","Finally, before I turn it over to Joe for Q&A, just a reminder to say the date for our pharmaceutical business review on Wednesday, May 17. Thank you, and Joe, now to you for the Q&A.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Dominic. Michele, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask questions?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Gorsky","Good morning Matt. ","Q - Matthew Miksic ","Thanks a lot for taking our question. To Alex, I had one for you. You made some comments on tax policy. It\u2019s a bit important issue I think for investors. Everyone is kind of wondering how this new administration is going to go and given that you\u2019d met with them recently a couple of just quick points if you can shed any light for us. One, repatriation seems like something that has broad appeal on maybe something that could happen relatively quickly, but when we think about the investments that a lot of companies have made in tax optimization strategies, these include obviously things like overseas manufacturing assets et cetera, how would you want to see reforms put in place or based into place, what if anything can you read into where the new administration and Congress was headed in potentially putting that process in place or should we worry as I think some investors might \u2013 that this could be sort of a change that would click into place in 2017 or in 2018?","Alex Gorsky","Hey Matt. Thank you very much for your question. And just a quick comment first, I wanted to say how really pleased I am with the performance overall the company not only in Q4 but also for the full year 2016 and frankly how excited we are and confident in our prospects for 2017. I mean, if you look across the different businesses, pharma, medical device, consumer, the announced strategies that we\u2019ve actually had in place now for the past several years, I think our performance has been quite consistent with that. We are ending the year on a strong share note across all of our major franchises and we\u2019ve been able to do that while also investing for the future. You consider more than $9 billion invested in R&D. If you take a look at the other various strategic investments that we\u2019ve made in acquisitions this past year, in our consumer, our medical device, continue licensing options and our pharmaceutical business and then you compound that with some of the efficiencies and the continued path that we are on to making sure that where as effective and as efficient as we can be in our business it really delivered those results and again we think the prospects for 2017 are promising. ","As it relates to tax policy, look, I would say that the major themes that we\u2019ve been able to ascertain from our ongoing discussions with the new administration but as well as other stakeholders is they are clearly focused on growing the economy and growing high quality jobs, particularly here in the United States and we believe that any of the potential changes we stated openly that there are many aspects of the blueprint that we think would be very favorable. I think net-net anytime we can get more flexibility by moving two things like a territorial system outside the United States, to be able to invest back here in the United States and other areas, we think that\u2019s a net positive. Clearly, we are being very clear with the need to have an adequate transition. To your point, given some of the investments that have been made in previous tax constructs as well as manufacturing footprint, but so far, I remain very confident in discussions that we\u2019ve had that ultimately we will make changes to the overall tax system that will be a stimulus for growth and that ultimately will help Johnson & Johnson and many other companies grow at an even faster rate going forward.","Matthew Miksic ","That\u2019s great and congrats as you pointed on the solid performance, particularly adjusting for shipping days. Thinking about the portfolio, if I could ask a follow-up just on, if you could update us on your thoughts on the [Audio Gap] potentially?","Alex Gorsky","Sure Matt. Thanks for the follow-up. Look, I think overall, our strategy and our outlook around putting capital or working M&As has actually stayed pretty consistent through the past several years and that is, one, we want to make sure that something is strategically right that fits with our capabilities, two, that financially it\u2019s a sound investment. I think we demonstrated a lot of discipline and a lot of thoughtfulness about the way that we put the capital to work over the past few years. Next we need to just make sure operationally, that it can be done and that our ability to execute on those deals ultimately produces the kind of outcome for customers, produces the kind of value that we think is important. Generally, I think we\u2019ve been consistent with this over the past few years about 50% of our growth comes from external innovation. We think that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a very good cadence. And we\u2019ve been able to do that by the way without compromising our internal innovation. I mean, if you take a look at our freshness index of about 25%, of our sales coming from products that have been launched over the past five years, our continued increase in innovation across our portfolio and another comment that I\u2019d like to make is, also on what areas where we don\u2019t believe we should participate where we don\u2019t feel that ultimately we are helping patients or consumers do a greater degree or that we feel that there is a very strong technology path forward. Many of these are very strong businesses, but perhaps they are better in someone else\u2019s portfolio than ours, I think we\u2019ve shown a good discipline about that over the past few years. As I look across our broader portfolio, we would like to find the next IMBRUVICA, the next DARZALEX. I think we\u2019ve shown a great ability, particularly with our very strong scientific underpinning of being able to identify new opportunities, new mechanisms. We applied a clinical regulatory development expertise and then of course, our sales, marketing reimbursement teams have done a great job of making those new molecules frankly blockbusters. And you think about the fact now that in our pharma portfolio alone, we\u2019ve got 11 brands that are over $1 billion, ten growing at a very strong rate. And you compound that with what we\u2019ve done around line extensions we would like that. We have also said however that there are other areas of significant unmet medical needs where we do feel that either our clinical, our regulatory expertise, our global footprint, our sales and marketing reimbursement capabilities could increase the growth rate. We would also consider those. And I think that\u2019s been our guiding strategy for pharma. ","In Medical Devices, look, over the past several years, we\u2019ve divested some businesses, but we\u2019ve also particularly this past year I am proud of the investments that we\u2019ve made in areas like extremities. We made investments in spine and we\u2019ve also made some \u2013 obviously what we did in vision care and in cardiovascular. We are excited about that and we\u2019ll continue, I think, that progression to look at portfolio opportunities and devices.","And with our Consumer business, I am very proud of the progress that team has made over the last three years, for their - look, mission number one was to make sure that over-the-counter business or quality issues were remediated. We\u2019ve done that, I think the team has done really a remarkable job of meeting all the FDA requirements and by the way, we did that while reinvesting right here in Pennsylvania in the United States, in a plant in Fort Washington that we now feel is world-class and really will set the standard around OTC production going forward. Now, that we\u2019ve made that progress, we of course made the investment in areas like Vogue, and other portions of that portfolio that we think will be generating growth in 2017 and 2018 and beyond. ","So, I think at a macro level, that\u2019s the way we look at it. If I take down each one of the franchises that\u2019s my description as well, Matt. ","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein ","Thank you. Can you hear me okay?","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Mike.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Mike.","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Mike, just speak up a little bit if you could please.","Michael Weinstein ","Okay, perfect. Well, first off guys, since the audio was off for probably ten minutes, you may want to send around the transcript, just to cover some of the sections that never made it across to everybody.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you.","Alex Gorsky","We will.","Michael Weinstein ","Yes, let me touch on a couple of items and maybe if I can do this first, Dominic, could you just comment on a couple of pieces of the guidance? The organic top-line outlook for 2017 looks pretty close to where we\u2019re at, but probably a little bit below the Street. Can you just talk about any puts and takes do you want the Street to be thinking about particularly in the pharma business relative to competition, be it REMICADE or the generic competition for Concerta? And then, second down the P&L, Dominic, can you just comment on the other income guidance which is a lot higher than, I think, people were expecting. It looks like you are assuming some sales there. So is there anything there that we should be aware of and then on the tax rate line, your tax rate is a good deal higher than it was in 2016. So if you could comment on that as well? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, sure, Mike. Well, just on the top-line, of course, we always give you constant currency guidance first. So I think it\u2019s important and when I look at the various models that are out there today that have not yet been updated, when I try to peel back the impact the currency it\u2019s pretty clear that our guidance and Street expectations if they were all adjusted for the same currency rates would be pretty much in line. So I think the Street has a pretty good sense of where we are headed in 2017. The major factors in pharma for example, obviously we included the impacts of a REMICADE biosimilar, I think many of you have also done that in your models. We will not see significant competition for other products like ZYTIGA and alike that could go generic by the end of the year, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any impact there. You mentioned Concerta, we will see an impact there. We\u2019ve already seen some impact there. And overall, I would say, I would characterize the three businesses as pharma, even without the impact of REMICADE biosimilars the growth rate is going to be slower than it was in 2016 just naturally as those products have been in the market for a while now, they\u2019ve achieved pretty good share. They still have room to grow, but the rate at which they grow, it looks like it will be a lot slower in 2017 than in 2016. Medical Devices and Consumer, we think will accelerate the growth in 2017 over 2016. With respect to other income, I mentioned that we had not completed everything that we had expected to complete in 2016, so therefore our actual other income line for 2016 was lower than our guidance, so naturally, we have some carryover into 2017. I want to emphasize though that since we are in the early stage of the evaluations of the diabetes as that line does not include any impact there, because there is no assurance that any transaction will get done in that regard. Nothing in particular that I would call out there. It\u2019s just that our normal review of the portfolio and looking at various aspects of the business, we think are either better in someone else\u2019s hands or we can get more value for our shareholders through a divestiture then of course we will reinvest as appropriately in the business and our guidance considers that as well. The tax rate is higher in 2017 that we ended in 2016. The impact of share-based compensation was greater in 2016 when we first implemented that we expect it will be in 2017, it could change throughout the year and obviously we\u2019ll continue to update you and then as we look at the mix of the business, international jurisdictions versus, domestic jurisdictions, and when you think of a situation where we have more divestiture income than a prior year, those divestitures are usually taxed at the US rate. So that adds to the effective tax rate for the year versus the prior year. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful Mike. ","Michael Weinstein ","It is, Dominic. Let me ask one follow-up on \u2013 and maybe two parts here, so, Alex, could you just talk about the decision relative to the diabetes business, obviously, given the importance of diabetes in the category, not an easy decision to consider other alternatives for the business? And Dominic, can you talk about the profitability of that business and I am asking impart because, if you do end up acquiring Actelion or some other transaction that would be accretive to earnings, if you end up not having the diabetes business, I just want to think about the offset? Thank you.","Alex Gorsky","Yes, thanks, Mike. Look, it\u2019s always a difficult decision and when you look at your portfolio and as I frequently describe, it is little bit like your children, you love all of them just from time-to-time we are trying to make decisions that we think ultimately are in the best long-term interest of our customers, stakeholders and our shareholders and we think diabetes is clearly an area of a lot of unmet medical need, we are very proud of the history and track record we have in blood glucose monitoring as well as insulin pumps and some of the things we\u2019ve been able to do. We are also very proud of frankly the performance that we generated over the past few years in products like INVOKANA, the progress that we made in areas like bariatric surgery that can have a huge difference in the metabolic space. That being said, we do feel that based upon the broader market dynamics, particularly things such as pricing in certain areas has led us to the point where we say the right thing for us to do is to consider strategic options for these three particular areas of the business. I want to be clear, we still are very interested in diabetes and we\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we think very important, very promising trials coming up in INVOKANA this year in fact. And it\u2019s a space where we\u2019ll continue to work with our Medical Device group, but we think at this point in time, it\u2019s important for us to look hard at these businesses and make sure ultimately that we are making the right investment for the future.","Dominic Caruso","And Mike, regarding profitability, as you know, you follow the industry closely. The diabetes pricing over the last several years has been challenging and although I think our team has done a nice job of adjusting the cost structure, the level of profitability that business has declined. We don\u2019t give you specific franchise profitability, but it\u2019s been challenging to generate strong profits in the business where there is significant price decline year-after-year. Without commenting on whether or not Actelion would or would not get completed, that transaction should it get completed would be accretive to both top-line and bottom-line and more so more than offset any impact to diabetes. ","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Mike. Michelle, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Wolk","Good morning David.","David Lewis","Good morning. A couple of quick questions and maybe some strategic ones. I guess, just, Dominic following up on a prior question here on REMICADE. I think the consensus view into this year is that REMICADE was something like a 1% hit to the top-line. Is that still a decent place to be for 2017?","Dominic Caruso","We don\u2019t give guidance by product, David, as you know. But I previously commented when you think of the fact that Merck had experienced two years of a biosimilar in Europe and they\u2019ve retained 70% market share after two years. So it\u2019s reasonable to assume 10% to 15% perhaps market share erosion in the first year. Of course, in Europe, it\u2019s much more dramatic, because of the impact of the healthcare system there. So, I think if generally, consensus is in that range that you\u2019ve mentioned, that\u2019s a pretty reasonable range.","David Lewis","Okay, and maybe just two more strategic questions. I guess, Alex, first of you for you, I know diabetes is going to be a topic this morning, but I guess, pruning devices shouldn't really be a surprise for investors, but I guess, I was struck by this notion of you are getting bigger in one of your big consumer Medical Device franchises which is ophthalmology, and then trying to get smaller in one of your other consumer device franchises which is diabetes. I mean, is it, should we be thinking about these two businesses the same way that you think about them as sort of two consumer assets and you want to get bigger in one and then smaller in the other?","Alex Gorsky","David, thanks for your question. The way that I would frame it as, we are very excited about the opportunities we have going forward in Vision Care. We\u2019ve looked over the past several years and first of all, I want to commend the Vision Care franchise for the work that they\u2019ve done over the last two and three years in contact lenses. If you look at the growth rates, I mean, we ended up with a double-digit growth rate in Q4 by that team and they\u2019ve introduced more than five new product launches. The execution in the field with customers has been outstanding. And frankly, when you think about the broader capabilities that we have in our surgical space and the potential to marry those up with our Vision Care business and of course, when AMO became available, we just thought that was a very good match, strategically and from an operational standpoint and Vision Care, just on a incidence basis, as we look at an aging population and things of that nature, we think that there is a lot of dynamics that would suggest we are going to see strong continued growth and we think we can be frankly be very best eye care company in the world as we continue to evolve that portfolio move ahead. ","Diabetes, look, as I said earlier, I am incredibly proud of the work of all of our Johnson & Johnson associates and what they\u2019ve done. We have people, scientists and people in the field that has spent their careers building that franchise. If you take a look at our actual volume share, we\u2019ve maintained a strong position. That being said, there are other dynamics within that market that make it more challenging as \u2013 particularly in comparison to other areas in our portfolio. So, I want to highlight the fact that we are still very early days in this. And we are taking a look at a range of options, but we also, as I mentioned earlier, remain very committed in the diabetes space through many of our other areas such as bariatric surgery, such as INVOKANA that continued in ongoing development programs that we have around that. So that\u2019s the way that we think about it.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, David.","David Lewis ","That's very helpful, Alex. Let me just\u2026","Joseph Wolk","Michelle, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Just a couple for you, Alex, you met with Donald, with our President Trump yesterday. Saw you on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. Just wondering what - you commented on tax policy, healthcare policy generally, repatriation, what do you think our new President is thinking in terms of drug pricing? Obviously, he has come out with very provocative comments about removing the non-interference clause. The industry has certainly been fighting that for years. The reasons to believe that may never happen, but what do you think the end-goal is here, because drug pricing, the whole drug pricing debate has been a major overhang over the sector, biopharma stocks for the past year and-a-half. What do you think the end-game is? Is he just trying to be provocative to change behavior? Or is the industry really willing to give something up? How do you think this all plays out? That would be very helpful. ","And then my follow-up question is, just on capital allocation and M&A, clearly, the pharma business has been the key driver of your growth for the past, say five years, most of the earnings beats has come from the pharma business. This quarter, the pharma business came in a bit lower, as you acknowledged growth will slow in 2017 versus 2016 as a number of your key growth drivers have slowed down and face competition. We all see the news around Actelion and I think the initial reaction is okay, that's nice, but that's sort of a small bolt-on deal, it doesn't really change the company. Would you consider M&A that is more transformative to the company? Is that something that you would consider? Or would you be prepared today to rule something out like that? I mean, when I talk - what I am thinking of here is, a transaction that would have a much bigger impact on the company in terms of the sales growth, in terms of earnings growth, in terms of reshaping the portfolio, et cetera, et cetera? Thanks very much.","Alex Gorsky","No, thank you very much for the questions Jami. Look first of all that \u2013 healthcare specifically was not a significant topic of discussion that we had yesterday. It really focused more on overall economic growth and as we mentioned earlier one of the things around tax, regulatory and other policies and that those are really the major drivers of the conversation. Clearly, the administration will be looking at healthcare and I think what\u2019s really important in all those conversations that I am sure will be coming, Jami, is that we look at healthcare in total. And the way that I would frame it is that, look, I believe healthcare for all the reasons that we\u2019ve talked about earlier is a growth industry going into the future and while \u2013 and we know the drivers of demand and aging population, increasing middle-class around the world, new technology that we are introducing and but, clearly that is going to put strain on the system and what we continue to emphasize is number one, the important role that pharmaceutical is playing in overall healthcare, we mentioned in the comments that pharmaceuticals make up between 10% and 14% overall of healthcare spend. If you look at a lot of studies, it would suggest that 75% of the improvements that we\u2019ve seen and things like mortality, and improvements and things like cardiovascular disease, cancer, HIV, are really due to pharmaceutical. And so we want to make sure that we continue to innovate and by the way I believe a lot of the technology and innovation that we are seeing right now truly has the potential to transform many diseases and move more towards disease interception, cures than what we\u2019ve seen in the previous twenty years. And so I think it\u2019s important to keep that perspective. Two, I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us as an industry to price responsibly. As you\u2019ve heard in the comments that I made earlier, we have attempted to do that. We believe that that has in fact been our practice. We announced some other additional steps that we are taking regarding transparency. We think that\u2019s important for the industry to do and we certainly do not want a few bad actors, I believe to color overall what is I think incredibly important contribution the pharmaceutical industry makes to overall healthcare. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be working obviously with our other trade partners, directly ourselves to maintain that and again, I remain confident that in the long run the most important thing we can do is continue to bring innovative products to market that make a big difference for patients and consumers and that\u2019s what we are going to focused on doing. ","Regarding capital allocation, as you mentioned, we are always looking at a range of options and I think that, what you see is that, our model that we\u2019ve used and I mentioned earlier the approach that we\u2019ve taken in pharma that tends to be bolt-on, takes early licensing opportunities, I would argue has been very successful and I think if you look at the number of launches, the number of billion dollar products that we\u2019ve been able to create during that timeframe, the difference that we made for a lot of patients shows that it is not a surprise as Joaquin will sometimes say, but in fact, it\u2019s rooted in a lot of strong capability. And we would expect to continue that going forward. We look at a range of opportunities and I think we\u2019ve been very clear about five therapeutic areas where we want to focus, because we do think we have strong capabilities there. It\u2019s not to the point of being dogmatic. We challenge ourselves. We do look at large opportunities. We look at very significant transformational changes to our portfolio. We have broad discussions about that with the Board. What I would highlight Jami, is that, I think the large transactions, by their very nature tend to be more challenging. They tend to be more than initiatives that are focused on growth and innovation as the majority of ours have been, they tend to focus on cost-cutting in synergies, operationally, they are just more challenging. And so for all those reasons, we found it to be much more successful to take the earlier stage, the smaller stage companies and add our capabilities that ultimately we have a good strategic and a good financial outcome for the company and for our shareholders.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Jami. Michelle, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. ","Joseph Wolk","Hi, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen ","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Dominic, one for Alex. Let me just ask a little bit more on the top-line guidance for 2017. The delta between the 2016 organic sales result of 7.4% and the organic growth guidance of 3% to 3.5% is a bit greater than we expected, Dominic, based on your previous comments, I think on the Q3 call. It feels like something may have changed since the Q3 call, is that fair? And then I had one follow-up for Alex.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, I don\u2019t think anything has dramatically changed. I mean, we are not calling out any particular impact to REMICADE and I think you are all familiar with the fact that we are going to see some slower growth throughout many of the pharma brands that have done exceptionally well up to this point. I just remind you that, we had a very significant impact with hepatitis C, not too many years ago and we did call that out, because that was very significant. The impact to REMICADE biosimilars is nowhere near that level of impact. So I don\u2019t think anything has changed dramatically, Larry, just sort of pace of growth in each of the businesses as we look into 2017 it\u2019s still going to be good, but as I said pharma, just a bit slower than it was in 2016.","Larry Biegelsen ","All right, thank you. And Alex, if you divest the diabetes business it will represent the third major device divestiture since you became CEO. So my question is, are you done making major divestitures in the device business? And we all see what you are doing with cardio, I mean, I am sorry, with ortho, surgery, and Vision Care with the AMO acquisition building breadth and scale, but cardio, although, it's been a very strong performer, it is relatively narrowly focused. So how are you thinking about that business now? Thank you. ","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Larry, thanks a lot. Look, you are absolutely right. The three primary drivers of our strategy and we believe where the growth going forward and in our current portfolio orthopedics group, our surgery group and our Vision Care group and I think if you look at the underlying health of each one of those franchises, we are really pleased with the fourth quarter and the full year results in 2016. If we take a look at surgery for example, you see EP growing at about 14%. We see some of the other things like endomech, biosurgery, all growing at very strong rates. Hips and knees, we think came in and we are holding gaining share in many of the areas in vision care frankly had an incredibly strong quarter and we think it\u2019s well positioned for growth in spite of even new competition with launches in 2017. So, we think that those franchises are very well positioned. As we look to the future, in cardiology, we are very proud of the success that we\u2019ve had with our EP business. As I mentioned earlier, when you see EP, we probably have about 32, 33 consecutive quarters now I believe of double-digit growth. We\u2019ve had a constant cadence of new innovation. We have done some small tuck-in acquisitions for the year to augment that franchise. But we realize longer term and we\u2019ve been very open with it that we\u2019ll continue to look at the cardiovascular space because we do think there is a lot of unmet need, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll have to continue to evaluate strategically, financially to see exactly what is the best path forward. And, so I think \u2013 the only other caveat \u2013 or it\u2019s not caveat, the statement I would make, Larry, here is, I want to highlight it is early days. Regarding our decision in diabetes, we will look at a range of options. Again, I want to openly state the hard work that team has been doing in a very difficult and challenging marketplace and we\u2019ll keep you informed as we go through that decision process.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Larry. Michelle, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Glenn Novarro ","Good morning everyone. For Alex or Dominic, can you comment on device utilization in the fourth quarter? We've already seen several companies positively pre-announce to the upside a few weeks ago, particularly in ortho and spine and Dominic, I remember on the third quarter call in October you gave color on monthly trends saying, September was stronger than July and August. So, I wonder if you could provide similar color on the fourth quarter trend? ","And then as a follow-up, I am just wondering if we're starting to see greater seasonality in 3Q on the downside and I'm wondering if we're starting to see greater seasonality to the upside in the fourth quarter as kind of individuals work through their deductibles and plan more surgeries in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, Glenn, we don\u2019t have all the data for the fourth quarter in yet, but the projections that we looked that are published do show a improvement in fourth quarter utilization over third quarter utilization and as I said during the third quarter call, we did see a slowdown. It looks like it was in the summer months, and as September rolled around, it picked back up again. We don\u2019t have specific details by month in the fourth quarter that\u2019s reliable yet to comment on. But overall, fourth quarter utilization does look better than we saw in the third quarter. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s dramatically improved. I mean, we are still in very low single-digit year-over-year uptick in utilization. With respect to seasonality, we do see a phenomenon and that now, as you know, more surgeons are actually employees of hospital systems in the US that during what would be considered normal holiday period such as summer months or holidays, typical holidays that we do see less procedure volume, because it appears that there is more sort of vacation time et cetera taken by the profession that was previously the case when they were independent in running their own business so to speak as opposed to being employees of a larger institution. So we are seeing that kind of seasonality and you are right, sometimes you see an uptick when people try to fulfill or postpone I should say procedures to later in the year, so they can get their procedures in and have already achieved their deductible and other matters and then pay for the expensive or not to have to pay for the expensive surgery upfront. So we are seeing that dynamic as well. So I think this is going to change over time and it\u2019s beginning to change now as we see the dynamics in the market.","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Glenn, Alex here. I would really recommend that as we look at the overall device market, and given some of the changes that Dominic brought up, be it especially in the United States where physicians are employed, holiday, seasonality, things of that, but it\u2019s changing, it\u2019s very important in the device space to take a longer term perspective and I realized in the past that see some quarter-to-quarter variations, I think we will going forward, but if I step back overall and look at what \u2013 as the markets continue to develop on an annualized basis, I think we remain very confident in some of the underlying trends. But I think it is important to take kind of longer term view.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Glenn. Next question Michelle.","Operator","Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. ","Danielle Antalffy ","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just Alex, if I could ask on a high level, following up on some of the earlier questions, pharma has been a driver of outperformance over the last year plus and the Device business has been a relative underperformer although clearly seems to be stabilizing to improving here. But just thinking about the sort of mix of the businesses going forward, considering the competition you have coming for pharma, you expect pharma to slow, you expect devices to return to above market growth going forward, does this lend more \u2013 does this make devices more important relative to pharma going forward or how do we think about how you are sort of allocating capital between the businesses and even from a capital allocation perspective, which was asked earlier? Thanks so much. ","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Danielle. Look, we still think there is great opportunities in each one of these sectors and let me just with the pharmaceutical. In 2017, Dominic took you through some of the rationale regarding our guidance but, make no doubt about it, we still remain very bullish on the core fundamentals of our business. If you look at products like STELARA and SIMPONI growing in excess of 20% this past quarter, we got the additional Crohn\u2019s indication with STELARA that we think in and of itself could be a very significant opportunity going forward. If you think about the potential products that we have, guselkumab, sirukumab in the near-term and you compound that with new information that we are certainly hoping for with INVOKANA and you top that off with the future pipeline about ten compounds between now and 2019 and 2020 that we\u2019ll be launching, we are quite excited about that portfolio. And so, while we\u2019ll always be looking for opportunities to add on to it, if we look at that core performance, again we think it\u2019s been quite strong. What we see in the Medical Device is a continued acceleration. I mentioned some of the growth rates earlier around EP, endomech, biosurgery, let alone in some of our core ortho and Vision Care areas, if you compound that with some of the investments that we made, things like AMO, but things like in extremities, in cardiology as well as in spine, we think that\u2019s also going to help us accelerate growth even as we head into 2017. And we think the underlying fundamentals of that business have continued to improve over the past year and Consumer is certainly the same case. We ended the quarter in areas such as Beauty, OTC, wound care, quite strong and when you add that on to the several billion dollars worth of investments that we made with Vogue, but also in other areas we think that franchise is positioned for increased growth prospects as we head into 2016 and beyond. And then on top of that, look, we are going to continue to look for the kind of deals that I have outlined earlier that we think makes strategic and financial sense and that ultimately we can execute on. ","Joseph Wolk","Thanks Danielle. Michelle we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. ","Joseph Wolk","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Jennings ","Hi, good morning.","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Josh.","Josh Jennings ","Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to start we might be able to get a little history lesson, Alex, and Dominic, about what ACA implementation meant to Johnson & Johnson and the Pharma and Device businesses? I know it's hard to predict what's happening - what's going to happen moving forward. But what potentially \u2013 how the impact could be for the repeal of the ACA? ","Dominic Caruso","Yes, Josh, we had commented on this before. We did not see any significant impact uptick in business as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Certainly there was not much of an impact at all in the Pharma business on our Device business because of the nature of the type of device products we have, we did not see much of an impact. So therefore, any change going in the opposite direction, we don\u2019t think will be negative. We did see an impact in terms of the cost associated with the Affordable Care Act, but as we said before, we\u2019ve incurred approximately $1.4 billion between the pharmaceutical fee, increased rebates et cetera even excluding the currently postponed medical device tax. So we\u2019ll have to see when new legislation is announced, whether or not these fees and cost associated with the Affordable Care Act remain or if they are authored at any way. But those have already been incorporated in our business. We\u2019ve adjusted our cost structure accordingly and we have that fully baked in to our 2017 guidance as continuing as they currently are.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the question, Josh. Before I turn the call over to Alex for some closing remarks, again I want to apologize for any audio outage you may have encountered today. We will post the comments from Alex and I from early in the call in the Investor Relations section of our website following the close of this discussion. To ensure that everyone has access to any content that may have been missed. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","So, thank you all for joining the call this morning. We really do appreciate your participation and questions. And in closing I\u2019d just say that and reiterate our confidence and the strength of our businesses and our optimism for 2017. We look forward to updating you on our progress with delivering on our robust pipeline and commercial success in Pharmaceuticals, accelerating our growth in Medical Devices and capturing share gains and efficiencies in Consumer as we move through the year.

This is Joe Wolk, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Investor Conference Call to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the second quarter of 2018.","I am pleased to be joined for a discussion by Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also helping us out today is Matt Stuckley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. As many of you know, this is my first earnings call as Chief Financial Officer. I am very honored, excited and humbled to assume the role for this great company. ","Dominic Caruso leaves a lasting impact on the business in many ways. I want to personally thank him for his commitment to this transition. He has been very gracious with his time.

Well, as far as the first earnings call, I would hope you agree that the business did their part to help me ease into the role. ","Our solid second quarter results which reflects our highest adjusted operational sales growth since the second quarter of 2016 were driven by the strong double-digit growth in pharmaceuticals and accelerating sales momentum in our Medical Device business. ","Consumer sales were below our expectations. However, there were some onetime factors that depressed reported results. That said, we need to do better in the Consumer segment and have plans in place to accelerate growth in the back half of the year with many new product introductions. ","Let me now turn the call over to Matt to cover some housekeeping matters and kick off the sales review. ","Matthew Stuckley","Thanks, Joe, and hello everyone. Regarding today\u2019s agenda, I will start by summarizing enterprise sales and earnings per share for the quarter before turning it back to Joe for segment sales highlights. Alex will then provide his perspective on the company and the healthcare environment. ","Joe will conclude formal remarks discussing our earnings results and guidance considerations, as you update your models before we open the call up for your questions. We anticipate today\u2019s webcast to last approximately 75 minutes. ","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. There you can also find additional materials including today's presentation and accompanying schedules.","Please note that this mornings\u2019 presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding commentary included in today's discussion, as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.","Our SEC filings, including our 2017 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are all available at investor.jnj.com.","A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the second quarter. ","Now, on to the results. Worldwide sales were $20.8 billion for the second quarter of 2018, a 10.6% increase versus the second quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 8.7%, as currency had a positive impact of 1.9%.","In the U.S., sales were up 9.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.9% with the effect of currency exchange rates benefitting our reported OUS results by 3.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 6.3% worldwide, 5.7% in the U.S. and 6.8% outside the U.S. Joe will provide the same reference for each segment.","With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.45 versus $1.40 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.10 representing increases of 14% and 14.8% respectively compared to the same period in 2017.","On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 11.5%. Now I will turn the call back to Joe to go over sales highlights by segment. Joe?","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Matt. Beginning with Consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment highlighting items that build upon the slides that are being presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages referenced represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2017 or in other words, results that exclude the impact of currency translation. ","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion declining operationally 0.4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, mainly the divestiture of the COMPEED business in the Wound Care other franchise outside the U.S., total adjusted operational sales growth was 0.9% worldwide. ","Performance in the quarter included the one-time impacts of a transportation strike in Brazil and a retail inventory reset for the U.S. Baby relaunch. Taking those items into account, adjusted operational growth would have been consistent with Q1 at approximately 2%. ","Our largest consumer franchise, the OTC business led the segment with above market performance growing at 3.7% driven by share gains across multiple brands. Analgesics, namely TYLENOL and digestive products drove the growth. The Beauty franchise grew 1.8% operationally. ","As we referenced last quarter, growth in this quarter was expected to be negatively impacted by the Q1 seasonal inventory build of approximately $20 million or $300 basis points in the U.S. related to sun protection products stocking. ","This is primarily reflected in NEUTROGENA. Growth in the quarter was driven by market expansion and share growth for OGX and Dr. Ci Labo, as well as new product introductions in NEUTROGENA outside the U.S. ","Oral care performance in the U.S. saw solid growth of nearly 5% due to strong LISTERINE consumption from ongoing promotions and new products. The divestitures of the REACH and REMBRANDT brands negatively impacted worldwide growth by just over 1 point. The OUS declines are due to competitive pressures.","As I mentioned earlier, Baby care results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the U.S. Baby relaunch as retailers reset their shelves for the new products that started shipping in July. Results outside the U.S. reflect competitive pressures partially offset by continued expansion of AVEENO Baby. ","Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $10.4 billion grew 17.6%. Excluding the net impact of the Actelion acquisition, operational adjusted sales growth was 11% worldwide representing strong above market growth. ","Growth was broadly based, both geographically, as well as across therapeutic areas with double-digit growth in nine key products including pro forma sales for UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT obtained in the Actelion acquisition. The segment was led by the oncology portfolio, which grew globally 39%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing globally by approximately 68%. ","In the U.S., market growth and the strong launch uptake of the one prior line indication is resulting in share gains. Outside the U.S., DARZALEX is experiencing increased penetration and share gains in the 31 EMEA countries in which it is now commercially available, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region where it received approval late last year. ","IMBRUVICA in the U.S. gained more than three points of market share versus prior year across all lines of therapy based on first quarter data largely driven by share in line one Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or CLL. The CLL market is estimated to have grown approximately 13%. ","ZYTIGA had another strong quarter growing 60% due to the continued market growth of approximately 33% and strong share growth in the metastatic high-risk castration sensitive prostate cancer indication based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. ","Our Immunology franchise posted 12% sales growth despite the negative impact of biosimilars on REMICADE sales. Growth was led by STELARA up 34% where we remained very pleased with the uptake of the Crohn\u2019s disease indication. Market share has improved 10 points in Crohn\u2019s disease, compared to the second quarter of 2017. ","REMICADE in the U.S. declined approximately 14%, largely driven by price erosion. REMICADE has retained approximately 94% of the Infliximab volume share. ","Lastly, in Immunology, sales for a newly launched treatment for psoriasis TREMFYA totaled $126 million due to strong demand with over 15,000 patients now on therapy. TREMFYA has already achieved a 5% share of the psoriasis market. ","In Neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate, long-acting, injectable portfolio grew steadily in all regions driven by new patient starts and persistency. ","Results for the Actelion pulmonary hypertension assets acquired in June 2017 are comminuted here on a pro forma basis. OPSUMIT growth accelerated globally to 16% due to increased share and market growth. UPTRAVI continues to experience strong demand with 41% growth in the U.S. ","Of note, the dynamic we highlighted in recent quarters regarding an increased level of patients on assistance programs in the U.S. has improved. As expected, TRACLEER is declining as generics entered the European market during the second half of last year.","Turning our attention to the Medical Devices segment, worldwide Medical Device sales were $7 billion growing 1.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9% worldwide. ","We acknowledge there is still work to do here but this represents our strongest growth since Q3 2016 and is a positive step toward the above market growth we plan to achieve in 2020 highlighted during our recent Business Review Day.","Operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in Interventional Solutions and Vision, as well as improving growth in surgery. Within Interventional Solutions, our market leadership in electrophysiology coupled with our new product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters continued to propel the overall market and our own growth which was more than 17% worldwide. ","Vision delivered strong growth in both the contact lens and surgical business across key geographies totaling $1.2 billion in sales and worldwide growth of 9.6%. The contact lens business grew a very healthy 10.5% on the strength of our ACUVUE OASYS and ACUVUE moist lines, most notably, in our market-leading astigmatism lenses. ","In Vision Surgical, worldwide growth of 7.5% was driven by the cataract business, primarily intraocular lenses. ","In Orthopedics, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, performance was flat to the second quarter of 2017. In Trauma, growth is driven by our newer products like the TFNA Femoral Nail. In Hips, we continue to be the market-leader in the anterior approach and see strong demand for the primary stem actives although we estimate the market growth was only about 1% in the U.S. ","Subsequent to the quarter, we completed the acquisition of assets from Medical Enterprises Distribution, which includes the automated ME1000 Surgical Impactor for use in hip replacement. The new name for this technology is the Concise Surgical Automated System. ","In Spine and in Knees, we are losing share. However, new product launches in Spine and launch of the ATTUNE revision system in Knees, led to improved performance this quarter in both businesses. ","Selling days did provide a benefit of approximately one point to Orthopedics growth for the quarter offsetting the negative impact we noted in the first quarter. We do not expect selling days to have a material impact on results for the remainder of the year. ","Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in Orthopedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative 5% in Spine, negative 3% in Hips, negative 2% in Knees and negative 1% in Trauma. Within the surgery group, the advanced surgery category was strong leg by growth outside the U.S. ","On a worldwide basis, endocutters grew 7% as new products are experiencing strong demand and bio surgery grew over 8% driven by Topical Absorbable Hemostats & Biologics.","In General Surgery, Wound Closure grew 5% with growth in all regions as barbed and plus sutures are experiencing strong adoption. ","As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the first quarter of 2018, we saw a slight increase in hospital emissions of 50 basis points. Surgical procedures were down approximately 1% and lab procedures were up about 2.5%. Our preliminary estimates for the second quarter indicate consistent rates for hospital emissions and surgical procedures with lab procedure growth lowering to approximately 1.5%. ","That concludes the sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2018 second quarter. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky ","Thank you, Joe, and thank all of you for joining our second quarter earnings call and webcast today. I am pleased to be here today to discuss our strong performance in the second quarter of 2018 and how we are well positioned for the rest of the year and for the future. Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance to-date both for the first half of this year, as well as in the second quarter.","Our accelerating sales and EPS growth results exceeded consensus estimates. Following my remarks, Joe will provide deeper insight into how our performance and outlook will impact our full year guidance for 2018. ","Before I provide some perspective by business segment, it\u2019s important to begin where I usually do emphasizing that we are always guided by our credo and this year, we proudly celebrate its 75th anniversary. Our credo is as relevant today as the day it was written, balancing opportunity and responsibility we are united and inspired by our credo and we live into the responsibilities it outlines each and every day. ","It reminds us that our first responsibility is to our customers and patients and it compels us to deliver on our responsibilities to our employees, our communities, our environment, and last but not least, our shareholders. And the success we achieved can be directly attributed to our more than 134,000 diverse and talented Johnson & Johnson employees in 60 countries around the world who exhibit our credo values every day in every way ","I am also proud to share that we released our Johnson & Johnson 2017 Health For Humanity Report in June which highlights how we are preparing for the future, meeting our enduring commitments to create long-term value and positively contributing to society. This report shares the progress that we are making toward our Health For Humanity 2020 goals and our UN Sustainable Development goals. ","To complement the report, we also conducted our first ever Health For Humanity webcast to engage in deeper discussion about the report\u2019s contents on environmental, social and governance topics. This session recording is available on our company website as well. ","We recognize that to lead the next frontier of health is a big commitment. We are ready, willing and able to take on this mission guided by our purpose-driven strategies and values rooted in our credo, we will always seek to put the needs in well-being of the people we serve first. ","Additionally, I\u2019d like to highlight that a few weeks ago, we announced Sandy Peterson, Executive Vice President and Group Worldwide Chairman had decided to retire from Johnson & Johnson effective October 1, 2018. Sandy joined Johnson & Johnson in 2012 and over her time with our company, she has had responsibility for our Consumer and Medical Device segments in addition to other business functions. ","I am sure Sandy will approach the next stage of her life with the same energy that she brought to us. Please join me in wishing her all the best in this new chapter of her life. In conjunction with Sandy\u2019s decision to retire, we implemented additional management changes that will ensure continued focus on delivering our commitments to all of our stakeholders named in our credo.","Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels have been promoted to Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee. The role of Vice Chair has traditionally been a part of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s leadership structure and in place for most of our company\u2019s history. ","In the Vice Chair roles, both Joaquin and Paul will leverage their expertise and credo-based leadership broadly across the organization and provide the enterprise with additional strategic counsel, direction and oversight. ","I am also pleased to announce that Ashley McEvoy has been promoted to Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman Medical Devices, which includes her continued leadership of our Vision business. Additionally, Jennifer Taubert will assume responsibility for the Pharmaceutical business and both Jennifer and Ashley will be members of the Executive Committee. ","Ashley and Jennifer are exceptional long-tenured Johnson & Johnson leaders with proven track records of success and who both embody credo-based leadership. These and other changes we have made in recent months recognize the deep bench of strength within our company and how we are utilizing the skills of our many talented leaders who will ensure that we continue to create value for our patients, consumers and our shareholders. ","Now, as you\u2019ve heard me say on several occasions, innovation has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of every life-saving and life-changing product and solution that we provide to people around the world and sustaining innovation has been the basis of our success and what has driven our growth and value through the years and will for many years to come. ","Increasing investment and innovation is a critical aspect of our strategy and the foundation for our future. In fact, last year we ranked number five in the U.S. and number eight globally across all industries for R&D investment and through the first two quarters of 2018, due to the benefits of the enacted U.S. tax legislation, we highlighted earlier this year, we have increased our investment in R&D by approximately 16% with the objective of developing new products and solutions that address today\u2019s medical needs and anticipate the medical needs of the future. ","We continue to invest internally at a very healthy rate progressing the rich pipelines across our three business segments and optimizing the innovative collaboration that happens within the walls of our company. And as you know, we recognize that good ideas come from everywhere. This is why we also seek and choose dynamic external partners to innovate with and who can help us unlock new treatments for patients and solutions for our customers. ","We are always on the lookout for value-creating opportunities and collaborations and to this end, we have closed seven major acquisitions of licensing deals since the beginning of this year. We also continue to enhance our status as a preferred partner being agnostic toward the best science and technology resides and aggressively pursuing transformational innovation. ","Additionally, we regularly evaluate each of our businesses to determine that they still fit our strategy and our criteria for value creation. And as you have seen us do consistently, what it makes sense we undertake a process to consider a different ownership for a business might be value-enhancing or if a business might be a better fit in another company\u2019s portfolio.","Recently, we announced the acceptance of a binding offer for our LifeScan business and the receipt of a binding offer for our ASP business. We expect to complete the LifeScan transaction by the end of this year and should the offer our ASP business be accepted, the proposed transaction would be expected to close in early 2019 subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals. ","Our activity in both mergers and acquisitions reflects our capital allocation priorities, which have remained consistent and we believe proven. First, as I just highlighted, we prioritize investing in our business at competitive levels then we allocate capital to drive long-term value by placing a priority on paying dividends to our shareholders, next we deploy capital for value-creating acquisitions and finally, we evaluate further opportunities to return value to our shareholders such as through share repurchases. ","Johnson & Johnson has the financial strength and cash flow to simultaneously return value to shareholders while at the same time continuing to invest in internal and external opportunities that further strengthen our robust enterprise pipeline and drive long-term growth. ","Now, I want to provide a few highlights about each of our business segments, but first, I think it\u2019s important to emphasize that we continue to think of ourselves as a 132 year old startup innovating and executing each and every day to win our customers\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 trust, confidence and support. ","We have a strong sense of urgency we are not complacent and we are not looking back, we are looking forward and moving forward as fast as the change happening all around this on the global, technological, social, economic, political and healthcare fronts. We believe Johnson & Johnson is strongly positioned for continued and future growth. ","Our Pharmaceutical business has delivered outstanding and sustained performance, growing at an adjusted rate of 11% inclusive of the impact of negative net price driven by the successful launches and growth of many blockbuster medicines. It has been an industry leader in all performance measures including R&D productivity and commercial capabilities. ","Earlier this year, we launched ERLEADA, a treatment for patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This is a second of up to ten promising new therapeutics that we plan to file our launch by 2021. Each of these new therapeutics has the potential for more than $1 billion of peak revenue. ","Throughout the rest of 2018, we have identified several other key catalysts for growth which focus on; continued patient penetration in oncology areas of prostate cancer and hematology, a growing immunology portfolio driven by the continued growth of established brands like STELARA, which is a biologic for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases and new products like TREMFYA which treats adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and this growth is even more impressive when you consider the REMICADE erosion due to biosimilars. ","Also, the pulmonary hypertension assets we acquired last year, which by the way this second quarter represents the strongest quarter we\u2019ve had to-date in this area led by OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. And the continued solid performance in long-acting injectables in neuroscience, XARELTO, and our HIV portfolio. ","We are confident that the continued growth of our marketed products and the expected launches from our robust pipeline position us well to outgrow the market for many years to come, while offering life-saving or life-changing solutions that give new hope to patients around the world. ","Now let me spend some time on our Consumer segment. As discussed at our Consumer and Medical Device business review back in May, I am confident in our strategies to move quickly to address new market needs with an omni-channel approach from the large box retailers to the e-commerce channels to better serve our consumers. ","The Consumer\u2019s second quarter sales growth was disappointing and as Joe mentioned, this was driven by the impact of some one-time events. That said, we recognize that we need to perform better here and we believe we are positioned for a strong second half of this year based on our strong underlying consumption data. ","Additionally, we are revitalizing our Baby business, in fact, beginning this month, our newly formulated Johnson\u2019s Baby products has started to ship to retailers across the United States. We continue to strengthen and expand our portfolio of iconic science-based and professionally endorsed products and we have a number of planned launches in the second half of this year. ","We also believe that this will drive top-line growth that will be met with even greater bottom-line growth as we continue to improve our productivity and margins. ","In Medical Devices, we have powerful opportunities for growth across our Orthopedics, Surgery, Interventional Solutions and Vision businesses. We have businesses which again displayed great strength in the second quarter such as Vision and Electrophysiology reaching double-digit growth and biosurgery and endocutters reaching high-single-digit growth. ","But we fully recognize that our progress has not been uniform across the entire portfolio. There are areas where we must and we will improve such as in our Knee and Spine businesses, both of which took positive steps forward in Q2, while growth was still negative, our Knee business improved performance compared to the last quarter driven by the recent launch of our ATTUNE revision platform. ","Similarly, our Spine business improved performance in the second quarter due to the new products we\u2019ve launched in this space. We\u2019ve also increased investments across our Medical Device portfolio in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions that our customers are demanding. Additionally, we are improving our cadence of innovation and are on track to deliver 15 to 20 major product launches planned for 2018. ","We are driving innovation, partnering closer with customers, simplifying operations and focusing on execution, all to meet the needs of customers and patients, when, where and how they want their needs to be met. We believe these drivers will deliver sustainable, above market growth across the entire breadth of our Medical Devices businesses starting today and we are committed to delivering across the portfolio in 2020. ","Now as a broadest based healthcare company, when we look at the current marketplace, business landscape and external environment, we are often asked about the potential impacts to our business and industries. Let me address a few of those topics that are in the current headlines. ","Regarding the recent St. Louis Talcum Powder lawsuit and verdict, as you know, our Baby Powder is a trusted product that we sold to families for over 100 years and Johnson & Johnson is deeply disappointed in this verdict. Now, we remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos and do not cause ovarian cancer and we intend to pursue all available appellate remedies. ","In fact, every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed. ","Additionally, I want to emphasize that preeminent scientific and regulatory bodies including The National Cancer Institute, The US Food and Drug Administration have fully reviewed the full body of scientific evidence on multiple occasions and found that it does not support the allegation that talc causes ovarian cancer. ","Like previous appeals, we are confident that there are multiple grounds for a reversal of this jury verdict and that ultimately the case will be reversed. ","Regarding global trade, as a global company, Johnson & Johnson relies on free trade and open markets to bring its products to patients and consumers around the world. We continue to work with government officials because fair and equitable trade is in everyone\u2019s best interest, not just for companies but for the consumer. ","We will continue to monitor developments very closely on this front as we expect this to be an issue in motion for some time. ","Regarding overall healthcare costs and drug pricing in the United States, I\u2019d like to make a few key points. First, let me say that we understand why there is such a passionate dialogue on this topic. We know that people are facing higher out-of-pocket cost, when they seek medical care from a hospital, a doctor\u2019s office or some other alternative healthcare provider, and especially when they go to the pharmacy to get medications. ","However as a point of reference, medicines represent 14% of the total healthcare cost in the United States and medical devices represents 6% of the total healthcare cost in the United States. The remaining 80% is accounted for by areas outside of our industry. I\u2019d also like to emphasize that the value derived from innovative medicines has been and continues to be significant in addressing health issues today and reducing morbidity rates in the future. ","Furthermore, medicines have contributed greatly to extending life expectancy. For example, cancer deaths have declined 20% due to pharmaceutical treatments since the 90s. All these improvements actually offset healthcare costs in the U.S. We also believe changes are needed regarding how we cover and pay for medical care and drug treatment therapies in the U.S.","We are working with various partners in the healthcare system to transform the way healthcare is paid for, so everyone involved is held accountable and rewarded for the value they deliver. That said, there are a few items that we typically focus on when participating in the healthcare cost and drug pricing dialogue and they include; first, a system that rewards innovation, companies need to continue to fund research and science and technology and invest in new ideas and new products. ","We have the best healthcare system in the world here in the U.S. and we want a system that allows us to keep it that way. We also want to see a system that is personalized and value-based. A value-based system begins and ends with the patient at the center of every consideration and is judged on the overall outcome. ","Striving to provide patients with convenience and innovative capabilities for healthcare management, affordable access and coverage choices and personalized healthcare experiences remains a top priority for Johnson & Johnson. ","Second, transparency. I am really proud that our Pharmaceutical business is taking a lead in transparency in the industry. We just issued our second annual report on transparency and as a matter of fact, this year\u2019s report shows a decrease in net prices for the products in our portfolio. Our Janssen U.S. transparency report shows, in 2017 the net impact of price on our Pharmaceutical business was minus 4.6% after rebates and discounts of nearly $15 billion. ","And lastly, as we continue to engage in dialogue and develop proposals that contain healthcare cost, we need to be extremely careful and cognizant about avoiding unintended consequences which may increase patients\u2019 cost further and\/or decrease patients\u2019 access to affordable and quality healthcare. We are really glad that the administration has called for a fact-based dialogue, we believe a discussion based on facts is a good thing. ","It\u2019s too early to predict the impact of any potential new federal regulations, but it\u2019s an important issue we recognize that and we want to help lead to solutions. We know that it\u2019s our responsibility and we will continue to unite around efforts that address some of the most critical health and consumer needs of people around the world and as we consistently live up to these values, I am very proud and honored to share several industry recognitions for Johnson & Johnson as few months and it further underscore our commitment to make diversity and inclusion in every day behavior, create an open supportive and includes a professional environment where people can bring their whole selves to work, build a global diverse workforce for the future that consistently enhances our business performance and reputation and ensure that good health is within reach for every one everywhere. ","As a global healthcare leader, we operate the intersection of science, technology, speed and change which enables us to re-imagine tomorrow today. As leaders of this great company, we take that responsibility very seriously. We believe in a bright and successful future or virtually anything that can be imagined, can be accomplished through a laser like focus on innovation, execution, and our customers, which ultimately drives superior long-term performance. ","And while we are focused on all of this, we also remain committed to fulfilling our credo responsibilities and striving to profoundly change the trajectory of Health For Humanity. ","Thank you for your time, interest, engagement and continued support. I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I will now turn the call back over to Joe who\u2019ll provide more insight on our results for the second quarter, as well as additional commentary about our guidance for the remainder of the year. ","Joe?","Joseph Wolk","Thanks, Alex. Since sales have been addressed, I\u2019ll comment on second quarter results related to cash, the P&L and then guidance for 2018. ","At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $14 billion of net debt, which consists of approximately $18 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt. ","Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2018, if you direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. ","As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2018 second quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.8 billion on an after-tax basis, the largest of which is intangible amortization. ","Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $2.10 exceeding the mean of analyst estimates. This is an increase of 14.8% versus the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.04, up 11.5% versus the second quarter of 2017. ","Highlighting a few items on the items on the statement of earnings, gross profit for the quarter decreased by 230 basis points, primarily driven by intangible asset amortization from the Actelion acquisition partially offset by segment mix. ","Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were lower as compared to the second quarter of 2017 by 60 basis points due to leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business partially offset by investments in Consumer and Medical Devices businesses in support of new product launches. As you heard from Alex, we prioritize funding for innovation. ","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.7%, which is higher than the second quarter 2017 as we continue to advance and enhance our pipeline. Other income and expense was a net expense of $364 million in the quarter compared to net expense of $527 million in the same period last year. ","Excluding special items recorded in this line, other income and expense was relatively flat with a net gain of $461 million in 2018, compared to a net gain of $434 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting divestiture gains. ","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.5% compared to 20.2% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. The 18.5% rate for the second quarter is the result of current interpretation of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, specifically relating to new provisions taxing international income. ","We anticipate the U.S. Treasury to issue regulations later this year. These anticipated regulations are reflected in our tax rate guidance, which I will provide shortly. ","Let\u2019s now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2018, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2017. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices at 27.8% is lower than the previous year, primarily due to acquisitions and new product launches. ","Pharmaceutical margins declined by a 130 basis points to 43.2%, driven by lower other income. Consumer margins improved to 25.7% due to divestiture gains, partially offset by an increase in brand marketing investments. ","Let me now share some perspectives for you to consider as you refine your financial models for 2018. Our sales guidance for 2018 continues to include the impact of biosimilars and generics for REMICADE, PROCRIT and TRACLEER. However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PREZISTA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA. ","As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. It\u2019s just the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2018 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. ","For the full year 2018, we will be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales of 4.5% to 5.5% for the year, an increase over our previous guidance. This would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $79.9 billion to $80.7 billion. We expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures will be between 3.5% and 4.5% for the year which is also an increase to our previous guidance. ","Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the euro as of last week at $1.17, for the balance of the year, the positive impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 0.8%. ","This is below the rate of $1.23 which we utilized in our previous guidance and results in a 120 basis point reduction. Thus, under this scenario, we expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 5.3% to 6.3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $80.5 billion to $81.3 billion. This is lower than our previous guidance solely due to the change in currency. ","Factors for you to consider for the balance of this year are the acceleration of our Consumer and Medical Device businesses, as well as the impact of generics and biosimilars that I\u2019ve mentioned. And tougher comparisons on the Pharmaceutical segment as this current wave of above market growth began in the third quarter of last year. ","Our pre-tax operating margin guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect to improve our pre-tax operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. For purposes of your models, and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $500 million and $600 million. ","This is lower than previous guidance as we benefit from an increase in interest income from higher rates. Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. ","We would be comfortable with your models for 2018 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion which is consistent with our previous guidance. ","Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2018 excluding special items is approximately 17% to 18%, which is a tightening of the range related to our prior guidance. ","Taking all of this into consideration, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.92 to $8.02 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting operation or constant currency growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.9%, which is higher than our previous guidance and reflects a tightening of the range due to the underlying strength of the business. ","Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at $1.17, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share which is lower than our previous guidance of $0.20 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.07 to $8.17 per share reflecting growth of approximately 11.2% at the midpoint. ","So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter results and remain confident about the strength of our business. Our underlying sales growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures is projected to be approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, an acceleration from 2017 and an increase of 1% over our guidance at the start of this year. ","Consistent with our principle to grow earnings faster than sales, our guidance for reported adjusted EPS growth is 10.5% to 11.9% or 11.2% at the midpoint. This is an increase of the midpoint versus previous guidance incorporating strong operational performance, partially offset by the impact of the strengthening dollar. We are confident in our performance not just for the balance of this year, but beyond. ","I will now turn things back over to Matt o open up the Q&A portion of the call. ","Matthew Stuckley","Great. Thank you, Joe and thank you, Alex. We will now move on to the Q&A portion of today\u2019s discussion. Rob, can you please provide Q&A instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. ","Larry Biegelsen ","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with one on the guidance and then one on Pharma. So the first half organic growth, it was about 5.3% excluding the acquisitions, divestitures and currencies and I think the guidance this morning implied second half organic growth of about 2.5%. ","So, my questions are as follows: what else besides the comps is leading to the slower second half expected growth? And where are you expecting directionally for each of the three divisions in the second half versus the first half? ","And then, I'll put as my second question here on pharma now, so ZYTIGA in the U.S. has been driving a lot of your growth in Pharma. How confident are you that you can continue to drive above market growth in Pharma in 2019, if you lose exclusivity for ZYTIGA later this year? Thanks for taking the questions. ","Alex Gorsky","Good morning, Larry. Good to hear from you. Let me take the second question first. With respect to ZYTIGA, if you look at the strong quarter that the Pharmaceutical unit had, let\u2019s remove that growth out and still about 8%, well above any market comparator. So the portfolio is strong. You look at the uptake of TREMFYA, STELARA for Crohn\u2019s our growth is coming from multiple sources. So why we are very pleased with ZYTIGA\u2019s performance it\u2019s \u2013 we are not dependent upon it. ","With respect to the guidance, so we have raised the operational growth to the midpoint of five. There is some things that I think that need to be pointed out with respect to the second half. I want to state upfront though we do expect to grow in the second half in our pharmaceutical unit as well as accelerate as you heard at our Analyst Day for Medical Devices and Consumer, as a matter of fact I think you saw a positive, if not modest step in this quarter with respect to Medical Devices. ","But the comps are pretty significant year-on-year. If you look at the second half of last year where we had really I would call it, this new wave of above market growth for the pharmaceutical unit, it was dependent upon STELARA doing so well in Crohn\u2019s, the launch of TREMFYA, the LATITUDE data came out for ZYTIGA. ","The way we looked at it was, the first half growth of this year compared to the second half of last year was about 4% - 4% to 5%. We expect that business to continue to grow going forward and again with the other sectors kicking in as well, we think it bodes pretty well for the entire year. ","I would also say we are likely to see a little bit more pronounced effect from generics in the back half of this year. So PROCRIT CONCERTA and obviously TRACLEER in the U.S. So those are the some of the things that I would consider as you look out for the balance of this year. ","Larry Biegelsen ","Thank you for taking the questions. ","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Larry. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. ","Glenn Novarro ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Alex, I have two medical device questions for you. First, toward the tail-end of the device, meaning, you made the comment about mid-size to larger medical device acquisitions and you commented that if the opportunity was there and it felt right that\u2019s something that you would consider. ","So, Alex, I am wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on that comment from the medical device day in light of maintaining the Triple A rating in light of over $30 billion of debt on the balance sheet and in light of a new head of medical devices. And can you quantify what mid-size to large means to you? ","And then, lastly, on medical device strategy, given the fact that you do have a new head of medical devices. Does anything change in the near-term and what I am referring to, it seems like Sandy\u2019s strategy to accelerate growth was a function of divesting slow growth businesses and doing tuck-in deals. So should we assume that strategy is maintained in the near-term? Thank you. ","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Glenn. Thank you very much for your question and look, before I answer both of them, let me also just reiterate some of Joe\u2019s earlier comments and congratulate our business leaders, I believe for producing results this quarter that were very strong and very consistent with a lot of the strategic goals that we had set in place and that we discussed over the past several years. ","It started with our Pharmaceutical sector, but even the increased performance I think we saw underlying in Medical Devices, particularly in Vision Care and hospital medical devices, and what we clearly have got work to do in Consumer, we believe we got strong reasons to believe in the back-end of the year given some of the launches that we will be focusing on as well as other areas of improved execution that we\u2019ll see that delivering at and above market growth rate. So, I just want to thank all of our employees for making those possible. ","Now as it relates to Medical Devices, Glenn, consistent with comments that I\u2019ve frequently made in the past, we remain very interested in value creating inorganic growth opportunities in Medical Devices. We are quite excited about the 15 to 20 launches that we have in place for this year and over the past couple of years, I think what we\u2019ve seen is an uptick in the number of bolt-on acquisitions that we\u2019ve done. ","In fact, just last year, we invested more than $1 billion in our Medical Device group giving us good new technologies, really across almost all of our major platforms. And of course, with our very strong balance sheet, it also gives us the flexibility to continue to invest going forward. ","I won\u2019t comment specifically on exactly what size or obviously what companies, but when we think that the strategy is right, that it fits with our portfolio, that we feel that ultimately we can actually create value, based upon the asset and operationalize it and execute, we are ready to do so. ","Regarding the overall strategy of the Medical Device unit, given the change in leadership, I would like to again thank Sandy for her leadership and for what she contributed, really not only in Medical Devices, but across the other areas of our business, but also welcome Ashley who is really a seasoned Johnson & Johnson leader with extensive experience in medical devices really for about the past eight years both in our ETHICON, as well as our Vision Care business where she led a very significant turnaround. ","But we believe that the underlying strategies of focusing on innovation, i.e. increasing the amount of launches and also bolt-on acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, we expect that to continue and improved focus on execution which has been in place over the last 12 months. ","But we\u2019ll continue going forward and we think that we are seeing the early signs that in fact that strategy and that plan is paying off as you saw our HMD growth rate of just about 3.5% for this quarter and you saw Vision Care continue to grow at an overall rate of about 9%. ","So, that\u2019s the way that I would look at it and thank you very much for your questions. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. ","Jami Rubin ","Hi, thank you. Alex, and this is a question for you as well, Joe I\u2019d love views on this. Corporate simplification is clearly getting rewarded on Wall Street and JNJ has certainly participated in this strategy by selling underperforming businesses. ","But investors have actually rewarded much bigger steps to reshape portfolios, most recently Novartis announced decision to spin Alcon, GE's decision to spin its healthcare business, obviously we have seen massive long-term outperformance in both AbbVie and Zoetis, which were spin outs. You have been consistent in your view that your credo 75 years old now embraces a conglomerate structure. ","But just wondering if there is an appetite internally now with a new CFO in place and with the recent underperformance of the stock to rethink the conglomerate structure after 75 years is it time to tweak this credo? Thanks. ","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Jami, thank you very much for your question. And look, what I would say is, we are always challenging our internal strategy and as you and I have talked about in the past that, our diversified strategy is not predicated upon our 130 plus year history, but it\u2019s really predicated upon our excitement and our outlook for overall healthcare and our performance going forward. ","As it relates to some of the recent transactions across the business, what I would say here too, if you look out over a 25, or 10 or 15 or five or three or even a two year overall performance, what you\u2019ll see is that Johnson & Johnson has outperformed and we really manage the business with that kind of a long-term outlook. ","I think you\u2019ve also seen that over the past several years, we\u2019ve been much more disciplined and focused on pruning our portfolio in appropriate places where frankly we didn\u2019t feel that we saw significant growth opportunities or perhaps where good companies, good product lines were better suited in someone else\u2019s hands as we continue to invest in more promising areas and we will continue to evaluate those kind of strategies and on our model and on our approach going forward. Thank you very much. ","Joseph Wolk","Jami, the only other thing I might add to that and maybe emphasizes Alex\u2019s point is that, we are performance-based. So, while our heritage may say we were constructed a certain way if we don\u2019t perform and we don\u2019t have the same, I would say strategies that we are executing upon in terms of being leaders in the markets in which we play driving earnings a little bit faster than the top-line growth and then having the capital allocation priorities that you become very familiar with, we would challenge that. ","And so, the nice thing about the transition between Dominic and I is that there doesn\u2019t need to be an upheaval of policies or company protocol because the performance is borne out that it\u2019s certainly is very strong and it works. ","Jami Rubin ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. ","Vamil Divan ","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, couple on REMICADE if I could. Just it looks like it\u2019s about a 16% decline in the first quarter if we excluded those one-time impacts and about 14% this quarter in the U.S. Is there any sort of sequential changes you are expecting either on price or otherwise as we think about the second half of the year or moving into 2019, just so we can kind of project obviously that very important product. ","And then the latest thing we can share on the lawsuit that Pfizer and others have filed against you guys on some of your contracting strategies, I think we are waiting for the judge to go on a motion for dismissal. Can you just give us a sense of when we expect to hear back from the judge and if the case goes forward, when do you think we may ultimately have a decision?","Alex Gorsky","Yes, so, with respect to REMICADE performance, yes, I think this quarter it was 14%, 16% adjusted in the first quarter. So, we don\u2019t see any step change from this point out to the balance of the year, what I would say is maybe you might see a little bit of increased discounts as contracts come for renewal at the beginning of the next year and there will be some accrual effect obviously in the fourth quarter for that product, but nothing significant. ","We still maintain about 94% of the Infliximab volume share. Regarding the lawsuit which we believe is baseless in its merits. There is really no update on that. So, we\u2019ll wait and see, but it\u2019s not something that concerns us giving the contracting practices that we employ and how that is on par with others in the industry. ","Vamil Divan ","Okay, thanks. ","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Vamil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis ","Good morning. Maybe one quick one for Alex and maybe two quicks for Joe. Alex, just coming back to the management changes, if I could. So, we all know Pharma has been the historic value driver for the business and I guess, by promoting two pharmaceutical executives to Vice Chairman, is it fair that investors would conclude your management sees Pharma as the driver or the primary driver of shareholder value creation on a go-forward basis? Why would that be an inappropriate conclusion? And then, two quick ones for Joe. ","Alex Gorsky","Sure, David. Thank you very much. I don\u2019t think that would be inappropriate conclusion to draw and what I would say is that, first of all, I would like to recognize and congratulate the great performance and frankly the significant value that\u2019s been created under the leadership of Paul and Joaquin and their leadership of our Pharmaceutical business. ","But I think it\u2019s also important to note that, look these are very broad seasoned leaders with more than three decades of experience and for the past several years, Paul was playing a critical role in our Pharmaceutical business. He is also taking an increasingly more active role across our R&D portfolio. ","And so, we look forward to having him continue to accelerate the value of our future pipeline and frankly the level of science and innovation that we have across Johnson & Johnson. Joaquin too is a very experienced leader who did have some experience outside, actually in the Medical Device area. But he is somebody who has a \u2013 again a long track record of leading through complex, challenging issues and significant opportunities. ","So by expanding his role, we think the impact that he can have in working with Jorge in our Consumer group, as well as with our information technology or supply chain and other areas will be very positive. I think the other important issue here, David is that, with Ashley\u2019s promotion, Ashley will continue to report into me and will reporting to me in her new role, maintaining responsibility for Vision Care. ","So, given her previous experience in Medical Devices, given my experience in Medical Devices, this will allow us to continue to manage our entire portfolio of businesses with the very strong leaders across Johnson & Johnson. And by the way I\u2019d also be remised if I didn\u2019t recognize Jennifer Taubert who will now \u2013 is now leading our Pharmaceutical business. ","Again, a very experienced seasoned leader who has been a big part of our Pharmaceutical growth over the past several years and we really look forward to seeing her upcoming contributions going forward. ","David Lewis ","Okay. Thanks, Alex. Very clear. Then Joe, just two quick ones for me. The first is, so that the first time I think you called out procedure growth as a driver of the AF business at quite some time. I wonder you see early benefits from the CABANA trial and then just a follow-up on Actelion, I think that business was a slight decline for first quarter, can you just update us on the growth rate of Actelion and you gave us the pieces, but the overall growth rate in the second quarter. Thanks so much. ","Joseph Wolk","Sure. Thanks, David. So, on CABANA, I think that could have a benefit to the market. It\u2019s probably still too early to make that determination that that\u2019s driving additional procedures at this point. With respect to Actelion, I believe if you look at the entire portfolio and it gets a little tricky because we had a minor divestiture there. ","But I think it was up about 2% where we are really focused on there as you know though is, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI where they grew very, very healthy double-digits for the quarter and again, as I noted in some of the prepared remarks, the dynamic of the patient assistance foundations does not seem to be an overhang. Thanks for the questions, David. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. ","Joanne Wuensch ","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Simply there are two. In Medical Devices, you pointed out that extra day added a percentage to growth. Is there anything else either in devices, pharma or consumer that needs to be called out that may have helped stocking, particular campaigns or et cetera?","Alex Gorsky","No, I think this was a fairly clean quarter with respect to that. There was some selling days in Medical Devices, primarily in the orthopedics side of things that we called out in Q1, which was a hurt it comes back as a help this quarter and then some of the factors in consumer which depressed the reported results which we should see come back to us in the back half of this year. But nothing around gross to net anything of that nature, Joanne. ","Joanne Wuensch ","That\u2019s helpful. And then, as my follow-up, I appreciate the progress made in Spine and in Knees sequentially, but they are still struggling. And those are markets that are even on a good day or probably growing 1% to 2%. How do we think about them really being additive to the total organization? And how long does it takes to go from a negative growth rate to even the market growth rate? Thank you. ","Alex Gorsky","Joanne, thank you very much for your question. And, look, we have been disappointed with the performance of both of those segments. However, we are confident going forward and let me just take each. If we look at our underlying Knee business, even just on a sequential basis from first quarter to second quarter, we are seeing underlying improvement. ","We believe that that\u2019s being driven by the launch of the ATTUNE revision and as well as the extended tibial plate. We\u2019ve got other launches regarding the cementless planned in the future and look for data around ATTUNE whether it\u2019s from UK, Australia, New Zealand or the Michigan registries remains strong and frankly we put a greater focus on execution with our sales force that we believe will continue to see a positive turnaround in that aspect of our business in the back-end of this year. ","As you know with Spine, that\u2019s been a longer-term issue. It\u2019s been a \u2013 frankly, we believe a market-driven issue to a very large degree albeit we have had some dislocation and complexity as we saw the Synthes and DePuy organizations come together that caused some challenge in our sales forces. And frankly, our innovation cadence slowed down there as well. ","I think we are now in a position where we put a much improved focus on stabilizing the sales organization. Two, we have \u2013 here is also a strong cadence of new launches with our interbody cage, with other type of guidance systems, as well as some additional nails, plates and screws and other systems that we think are also going to contribute to positive growth as we go through the back-end of 2018 and into 2019. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. ","Bob Hopkins ","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Sorry if I missed this, but just the first question is one of you could just comment on the impact on pricing, pure pricing on the pharma business in Q2 and more importantly, has your outlook for drug pricing for 2018 and beyond changed relative to the commentary that you made earlier in the year? Just looking for an update on this important topic. Thank you.","Joseph Wolk","Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. So, yes, it is an important topic as Alex referred to in his comments. So, if you look at the STELAR results and Pharmaceuticals where we had a 11% adjusted operational growth. That was in light of a price decline of about \u2013 let me see here, it\u2019s about 2% for the quarter. ","So it\u2019s been 4% year-to-date in terms of negative price, it\u2019s 2% for this quarter. We would expect that to be probably in the realm of about 4% to 6%, somewhere this year as we look over the back half of this year and given the results that we\u2019ve had in the first half. So, again, we continue to act responsibly in this way. As Alex referenced, our transparency report from last year indicated price down in the U.S. about 4.5%. You are looking at something similar this year. ","Alex Gorsky","Bob, what I would also just add there is that, I think it also just harkens back to the strong underlying volume increases that we are seeing across our portfolio, particularly in Oncology and immunology, but beyond that, our neuroscience group and cardiovascular has remained strong, as well as our infectious disease. So, again, on a very broad base, volume-driven, which means that ultimately we are reaching more patients around the world. ","Bob Hopkins ","Great. Thank you for that color. And then just one quick follow-up on the trends in orthopedics. I was wondering if you could just clarify on the selling day part. Was that a global impact for orthopedics or is that \u2013 was that more of a impact in the U.S.? And then I am curious, was there any change in your view on kind of orthopedic market growth rates in Q2 versus Q1? Thank you very much. ","Joseph Wolk","Matt, do you want to take this one?","Matthew Stuckley","Thanks, Joe. So, Bob, thanks for the question. The selling day impact that Joe quoted was global of about one point and that was pretty equal between both the U.S. and outside the U.S. I think as we look at overall Orthopedic market trends in Q2, relatively stable versus what we saw in Q1. I think in trauma is one in particular where we did see that market decline a little bit versus the growth that we saw in Q1. But overall, relatively consistent with the first quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. ","Danielle Antalffy ","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a follow-up question on the Spine business. It\u2019s been pretty weak and it seems like the market is actually very weak. And J&J historically has done a lot of reevaluating businesses and getting out of slower growth businesses that no longer make sense. ","Can you talk about whether this is even still a good market for J&J? Is this is a business just based on the recent performance that could be up for potential divestiture? And my next question, my follow-up there is, is this a market that might be moving in the direction of stem therapy ultimately and what J&J\u2019s views are there? Thanks so much. ","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Danielle, thank you very much. And, look, what I would say overall is, we still believe that Spine is a large attractive global market. There is a lot of unmet need, because as we all know, as we get older, a lot of the existing technologies don\u2019t deliver the same level of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. ","For example, that you might experience with the Hip or even in Knee replacement and look, while we are excited about the progress that we are making, and some of the strong cadence of launches and acquisitions, we clearly know that we have gotten more work to do at the performance of this business. ","And the reason for that frankly is, the continued slowdown with Spine category growth, especially in the U.S. We had some portfolio gaps as I mentioned earlier that we are now closing. And we had sales force attrition in 2017, which did have a negative impact that we think that that is now stabilized. ","So, while we still have got work to do, we maintain the number two position globally. We think that it\u2019s a very strong complement to the rest of our portfolio. But we are very, very focused on getting that business turned around and move it in the right direction. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. ","Geoff Meacham ","Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I have a few pharma questions. I got one for Joe and then a follow-up for Alex. So, Joe, on PAH, UPTRAVI hasn\u2019t beaten consensus really until this quarter. Was there something different in 2Q? And do you guys view this as a start of more sustained acceleration of the franchise? And there are several generics coming into the prostacyclin category this year, what are you guys\u2019 expectations on pricing or a step at it?","Joseph Wolk","Yes. So, with regards to the performance in the quarter, beating consensus, that\u2019s probably less relevant for us. I know it\u2019s important for you guys. But what I would say, it\u2019s just probably the Patient Assistance Foundation, we are seeing obviously the impact of the broader reach that Johnson & Johnson has with respect to patient penetration. ","Regarding generics coming in later this year, that\u2019s part of the guidance in which we\u2019ve provided. We\u2019ll see how that plays out and we\u2019ll just go from there. But that is part of our thinking going forward, Geoff. ","Geoff Meacham ","Okay.","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Geoff, this is Alex. The other thing that I might add is, look whenever you do this kind of an acquisition, there are certain elements in the transition that you got to work your way through and what I think part of what we are seeing frankly is now that we have several quarters under our belt that that team is really starting to come together. ","We are starting to realize the global selling synergies. I\u2019ve been particularly impressed with our medical affairs team and the way that we are looking at new opportunities to how do identify patients earlier? How do we start combination therapy earlier to actually help potentially stop the progression of the disease and combine with just general executional improvements that we see across the board that\u2019s why it makes us bullish on Actelion going forward.","Geoff Meacham ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Alex, when you look at the segments within Pharma, obviously oncology is a standout for growth, but you have neuroscience and cardio metabolic that are laggers, when you make \u2013 you and the Board make capital allocation decisions, there is a breadth of Pharma growth really inform your strategy. I guess, I am trying to figure out how aggressive you want to be on the BD front and whether the categories within Pharma really matter? ","Alex Gorsky","Yes, look, overall Geoff, what I would say is, that we still believe there is a lot of opportunities across the \u2013 really now six different platforms that we have in our Pharmaceutical group and it starts basically with unmet need. I mean, if you look at some of the lower penetration rates and the new categories, for example, in immunology, you still see penetration rates and things like psoriatic, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis of only around 35%. And even in the novel oral anti-coagulant class, you still see WARFARIN at about a 45% share. So, there is a lot of opportunity that we focus on. I think the other issue for us is that by taking this portfolio approach, not only does it allow us to expand into new patient opportunities and obviously do a lot with the medical affairs investment with new indications, but it also enables us to do that in a fairly efficient manner. So that we don\u2019t have to re-create sales or marketing or reimbursement organizations, but rather it can be another option in the portfolio and frankly that\u2019s why now for example, if you look in immunology, STELARA is well on its way to becoming our number one product. But if you look TREMFYA, SIMPONI, even with the REMICADE decline in the phase of biosimilars our overall portfolio approach I think is in fact really working. ","Joseph Wolk","Hey, Geoff, maybe just to pick up on Alex\u2019s comment too, because you called out neuroscience specifically. The core brands there, the long-acting injectables are only penetrated to the tune of about 15%. We know that that\u2019s the best way to treat those types of patients and that portfolio of assets is performing extremely well. So the reported growth for that particular therapeutic area is impeded by CONCERTA and some declines in ULTRAM and older products. I would also point to the excitement we have around ESKETAMINE in that particular space. So, we think we\u2019ll be filing that very shortly here and certainly by the end of the year. It\u2019s a novel new treatment for patients suffering from depression. We know that\u2019s the number one cause of suicide here in the United States and globally. So, we think that\u2019s going to be a very healthy therapeutic area for us going forward. ","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Geoff, just to tag on to that, our underlying LAI business in neuroscience is growing at about 12%. We think that category is less than 12% penetrated. And Joe is exactly right. If you look at the unmet need in the area of treatment resistant depression and frankly the what the data suggests with the potential for ESKETAMINE, we couldn\u2019t be more excited for patients or for our business going forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford ","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of device related questions and perhaps I missed this. But on the 15 to 20 new product launches in 2018, how many of that you launched already? And then my second question is just on the margin profile on devices, the business is generating 30 plus percent margins over the last couple of years. We have now changed two straight quarters of sub-30% margins. I realize there is a lot of moving parts in this number, but curious as to the source of margin softness. Is it a function of increased R&D investment? Is gross margin little softer? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. ","Joseph Wolk","Yes, so with respect to the new products that we\u2019ve launched in Medical Devices, I would say, we are probably about 60% of the way there at this point. Some of these are staggered launches. If you look at the ATTUNE revision, we launched fully here in the U.S. and then it\u2019s going to proceed globally. But I would say we are about 60% of the way in meeting that commitment for 2018. With respect to margin comparisons year-on-year, I would think that\u2019s going to be related to primarily other income and a lack of divestiture gains that were recognized in the first half of last year versus what we\u2019ve recognized this year. In terms of R&D investments, I would say that\u2019s up slightly. We are one of the highest investors in terms of absolute dollars in the medical device space and gross margin continues to improve from an operational perspective. There is a little bit of a headwind with the price obviously, but in terms of our supply chain as we announced last quarter, we continue to make refinements there to keep our costs highly competitive to provide patients and hospital systems with greater affordable access. ","Jayson Bedford ","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph Wolk","You are welcome, Jayson. ","Matthew Stuckley","Thanks for the question Jayson. Rob, I think we have time for one more question. ","Operator","Yes. Your next question is coming from the line of Rick Weiss with Stifel. ","Rick Weiss ","Good morning. Good morning, Alex. Hi, Joe. ","Alex Gorsky","Good morning. ","Rick Weiss ","Just, I just had one question. Really this morning we had \u2013 lot of mine has been answered. On the \u2013 on Slide 22, you had talked about the Medical Device portfolio and growth strategy, Alex, you highlight the notion that you are focused on maximizing new market growth opportunities and sites of care beyond the hospitals. Not a big deal probably, but, are you looking at sites of care beyond the hospitals just simply trends shifting to MHR surgical centers, is there is something more substantial here that you can do or thinking about really the home health, digital health, other new initiatives. Just any color would be very interesting to hear? Thanks so much. ","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Rick. Thanks for the question. And the short answer is, yes. But, in particular, in a lot of our conversations and discussions with hospital systems, as they are trying to navigate their way to the challenges that they are seeing in the current marketplace, clearly they are dealing with shifts in care from the traditional hospital operating room to the ambulatory care center, trying to do a better job of managing both pre-operative as well as post-operative care. And those are all areas that frankly we think are exciting not only in terms of the business opportunity but also in terms of a better position overall for Johnson & Johnson and ultimately improving patient outcomes. ","Rick Weiss ","Thank you so much, Alex.","Alex Gorsky","Thank you.","Matthew Stuckley","Thank you for the question, Rick and thanks everyone who asked the question today and apologies to those who we could not get to in time. However, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team needed with any follow-ups.","I will now turn the call back to Alex for some closing remarks.","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Well, thank you very much for your continued confidence and support in Johnson & Johnson. I think you\u2019ll agree with me that we had a very strong quarter that\u2019s quite consistent with the plans that we\u2019ve been laying out. As expected, we have some areas that we are particularly strong, others that we need to continue to focus on and improve. But overall, we are pleased with the progress that we are making and again, we appreciate your continued support. So, on behalf of the more than 130,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson around the world, who wake up every day trying to help patients and consumers with a longer, healthier and happier lives in a credo-based way.

A few logistics before we get into the details. The audio and visuals from this presentation are being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.","I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the fourth quarter for the Corporation and highlights for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Bill Weldon will comment on the 2011 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. At the completion of Bill's remarks, Dominic Caruso will provide some additional commentary on the fourth quarter financial results and guidance for the full year of 2012.

Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release or on the Johnson & Johnson website at jnj.investor.com.","Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2011. If you refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were $16.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up 3.9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. On an operational basis, sales were up 4% and currency had a negative impact of 0.1%. In the U.S., sales decreased 3.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 10.4% while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 0.2 points. The Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 17.8% operationally, while Europe grew 9.4% operationally. The Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 7.9% on an operational basis.","The strong growth in the regions outside the U.S. was due to the success of new product launches, the impact of the amended agreement with Merck regarding REMICADE and SIMPONI, as well as acquisitions such as Crucell. I will discuss these items in more detail in the segment commentary.","If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. Net earnings were $218 million compared to $1.9 billion in the same period in 2010. Earnings per share were $0.08 versus $0.70 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items.","As referenced in the accompanying table on non-GAAP measures, fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude items such as product liability expenses, the net impact of litigation settlement, costs associated with the DePuy ASR Hip recall program, and an adjustment to the value of the currency option and cost related to the planned acquisition of Synthes, Inc. Net earnings on an adjusted basis were $3.1 billion and earnings per share were $1.13, up 9.3% and 9.7% respectively versus the fourth quarter of 2010. ","I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. For the fourth quarter, cost of goods sold at 32.8% of sales was 60 basis points higher than the same period in 2010, primarily due to the impact of the Crucell business, as well as the ongoing remediation work in our OTC business.","Fourth quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses at 33.6% of sales were up 50 basis points. As we discussed last quarter, expenses including investment spending behind our new products, as well as the fee on our branded pharmaceutical products included as part of the U.S. Health Care Reform legislation. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 13.3%, 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to the impact of the recent collaboration agreement with Pharmacyclics. Interest expense net of interest income of $148 million was up $34 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a higher average debt balance. Other expense net of other income was $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $1.1 billion in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense was $501 million compared to $123 million in 2010. Excluding special items, taxes were 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011, bringing our annual effective tax rate to 20.1%.","Dominic will provide some additional commentary on both other income and taxes in his remarks.","Now turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the full year of 2011. Consolidated sales to customers for the year 2011 were $65 billion, an increase of 5.6% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, sales grew 2.8 points operationally and currency had a positive impact of 2.8 points. On the consolidated statement of annual earnings, I'd like to draw your attention to the boxed section. Adjusted net earnings of $13.9 billion in 2011 compares to adjusted net earnings of $13.3 billion in 2010. Adjusted earnings per share at $5 grew 5% versus the 2010 results.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting major products or businesses for the fourth quarter of 2011. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $3.7 billion increased 1.6% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 2.7%, while the impact of currency was negative 1.1%. U.S. sales were up 2.4%, while international sales grew 2.8% on an operational basis. For the fourth quarter of 2011, sales for the OTC Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals increased 4.6% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2010. Sales in the U.S. were down 2.9% due to supply constraints on certain products, partially offset by the return to the market of other key products and the impact of the acquisition of the full ownership rights to certain digestive health products. McNeil-PPC is operating under a Consent Decree covering the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Fort Washington and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McNeil continues to operate the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras and Lancaster, however, production volumes in some of these facilities have been impacted due to the additional review and approval processes required. Regarding the products previously produced at Fort Washington facility, McNeil continues to work on the resiting of these products to other facilities. McNeil is making progress on the validations at these sites and a modest amount of products returned to the market in fourth quarter of 2011. Product will continue to be reintroduced throughout 2012.","Sales outside the U.S. were up 8.7% on an operational basis due to the recent acquisition of the DOKTOR MOM and RINZA brands from J B Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals and the successful launch of new smoking-cessation products. Our Skin Care business grew 6.6% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter of 2011, with sales in the U.S. up 14.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 1.3% on operational business, primarily due to the success of NEUTROGENA new product launches. Baby care products achieved operational growth of 0.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due to increased sales of hair care and cleansers, partially offset by lower sales of lotions and creams. Women's Health declined 9.5% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. were down 24.6%, while sales outside the U.S. were down 4% on an operational basis. The sales decline this quarter was primarily due to the impact of divestitures of certain brands. Sales in the Oral Care business increased 7% on an operational basis, with the U.S. up 16.1% due to the success of recently launched LISTERINE products. Wound Care\/Other was down 0.5% on an operational basis compared to the same period last year, impacted by the divestiture of PURELL. That completes the review of the Consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceuticals segment.","Worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter of $6.1 billion increased 6.7% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 6.6% with a positive currency impact of 0.1 points. Sales in the U.S. decreased 8.3%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 25%. The loss of marketing exclusivity for LEVAQUIN in June negatively impacted worldwide pharmaceutical operational sales growth by approximately 8 points, and U.S. growth by approximately 13 points. Positively impacting the sales growth in the quarter were sales related to the recent acquisition of Crucell and the impact of the amended agreement with Merck, partially offset by divestitures. Excluding the items mentioned as well as the impact of inventory changes, the underlying worldwide operational growth was approximately 9%.","Now reviewing the major products. Sales in the U.S. of our key immunology products which include REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI were up nearly 20% versus 2010 with growth for REMICADE at 14.3%, STELARA at over 70% and SIMPONI at 10.7%. With this strong growth, we continue to be the market leader in immunology in the U.S. On a combined basis, export and international sales of REMICADE increased nearly 70% due to the impact of the amended agreement with Merck, complemented by international market growth. As a reminder, we began recording sales of products from the territories relinquished by Merck in the third quarter and the amended distribution agreement division of contribution income split of 50% also went into effect July 1, 2011. ","PROCRIT\/EPREX declined operationally by 22.6% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year with PROCRIT down 29.3%, due primarily to a double-digit market decline in volume. EPREX was down 13.7% operationally due to increased competition. RISPERDAL CONSTA, a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, was down 0.2% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. were up 2.9%, while sales outside the U.S. were down 1.3% operationally. The total sales of our long-acting injectables, including INVEGA SUSTENNA, increased nearly 20% operationally versus a year ago due to an increase in combined market share. VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma, for which we have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world outside the U.S. Operational sales growth was 22.4% with strong growth in all major regions. PREZISTA, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV grew operationally 34.2%, with the U.S. increasing 28.8% and the sales outside the U.S. increasing 39% operationally, due to very strong momentum in share. CONCERTA, a product for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, declined 25.4% operationally in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year, with sales in the U.S. down 40.6%. The supply and distribution agreement with Watson Laboratories Inc. to distribute an authorized generic version of CONCERTA in the U.S. became effective May 1, 2011. According to IMS, the authorized generic has captured approximately 80% of the combined CONCERTA script share. Sales outside the U.S. were up 11.6% operationally, driven by strong growth in most major regions. ","ACIPHEX\/PARIET is a proton pump inhibitor that we co-market with ASI. On an operational basis sales were up 1%, with the U.S. down 7.6% due to the impact of generics in the category. Sales outside the U.S. increased 8.7%, with strong growth across the major regions.","DOXIL\/CAELYX declined 34.1% on an operational basis in the quarter. Based on the update in December from our third-party manufacturing about the estimated time frame for resuming its manufacturing operations, we do not anticipate any DOXIL\/CAELYX produced at the supplier's facility to be available until late 2012. Restoring a reliable supply continues to be our most urgent priority, and we continue to explore a variety of options to bring a consistent supply of DOXIL back to patients and physicians as quickly as possible. ","INVEGA, an atypical antipsychotic grew 7.8% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 5.7% due to lower market share. Sales outside the U.S. were up 28.3%, primarily due to the recent approval in Japan.","INTELENCE, an NNRTI for the treatment of HIV grew 27.7% on a reported basis, with the U.S. up 32.4% and the sales outside the U.S. up 22.6%, with market share increases achieved in the major regions. ","As an update on the pharmaceutical pipeline regarding XARELTO, on December 29, we submitted an sNDA for an indication to reduce the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with ACS, and we anticipate the FDA's decision on that application later this year. In the second quarter, we plan to file an sNDA for the treatment and secondary prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism based on the completion of the Einstein trial. Also, after further consultation with the FDA, we have decided not to file an sNDA for the use of XARELTO in the medically ill population at this time, based on the results of the Magellan trial. Both results were initially reported last April at the American College of Cardiology Conference.","We continue to believe that XARELTO has the potential to address an important unmet medical need in this patient population and we are currently evaluating our options to pursue this indication, as well as several others where XARELTO may have a beneficial impact for the care of patients. In addition, the European commission granted marketing authorization for EDURANT as a once daily treatment in combination with other antiretroviral agents for HIV-1 infection and treatment-na\u00efve adult patients. ","We filed for NUCYNTA ER for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The collaboration agreement with Pharmacyclics to jointly develop and market the anticancer compound PCI-32765 was completed, and we recently entered into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for sirukumab. Sirukumab targets the interleukin (NYSE:IL)-6 and has completed a 2-part Phase II study for rheumatoid arthritis demonstrating promising results. We are pleased to have GSK as an experienced partner who shares our enthusiasm about (IL)-6 as an important target in RA, and look forward to moving sirukumab into Phase III development in 2012. I'll now review the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment results. ","Worldwide Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment sales of $6.5 billion grew 2.4% operationally, as compared to the same period in 2010. Currency had a positive impact of 0.3 points, resulting in total sales increase of 2.7%. Sales in the U.S. were down 0.4%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 4.6%. Excluding drug-eluting stent, worldwide sales increased approximately 4% on an operational basis. ","Now turning to the MD&D businesses, starting with Cardiovascular Care. Cardiovascular Care sales were down 14.5% operationally, with U.S. down 22.4%, and sales outside the U.S. down 9.6% operationally. Excluding drug-eluting stent, Cardiovascular Care sales grew approximately 2% on an operational basis. Biosense Webster, our Electrophysiology business, achieved operational growth of 11% in the quarter. The impact on disposables utilization due to the breadth of the installed base of Carto 3, complemented by new launches, made strong contributions to the results. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of endovascular products due to increased competition and a slower market.","The DePuy business had operational growth of 0.3% when compared to the same period in 2010, with the U.S. down 4% and the business outside U.S. growing by 5.7% operationally. Strong sales in sports medicine were partially offset by lower sales for knee and spine products. Results continue to be impacted by low single-digit price erosion, partially offset by positive mix. Operationally, hips were up 1% worldwide, driven by 3% operational growth outside the U.S., attributed to heads and cement with stems. In the U.S., hips were essentially flat. Knees declined 3% on an operational basis, with U.S. down 5% due to increased competition and a softer market. Sales outside U.S. were flat. The market was estimated to have declined modestly in the third quarter, with U.S. down 3% and the worldwide market down 1%. It is estimated that this softness in the market continued into the fourth quarter. Spine was down 3% on an operational basis with U.S. down 7%, primarily due to continued pressure on price. Sales outside U.S. were up 4%. ","The Diabetes Care business achieved operational sales growth of 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011, with the U.S. business up 3.8% and the business outside the U.S. growing 4.4% operationally. Strong sales in emerging markets and favorable mix in the U.S. drove the results this quarter. ","Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 7.3% with the U.S. up 7%, and sales outside the U.S. up 7.6% operationally. Drivers of the increase include sutures with strong emerging market growth, the strong uptick of the recently launched products, SECURESTRAP and PHYSIOMESH, as well as double-digit growth in Biosurgical. Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011, with the U.S. sales up 4.6% and the sales outside the U.S. up 6.3% operationally. In the U.S., growth was driven by increased market share for advanced sterilization products and our recently acquired SterilMed business. Outside the U.S., new product launches and the continued shift to minimally invasive surgery drove double-digit growth for HARMONIC products and strong results for the Endo products. ","The launch of the advanced energy Super Jaw and Gen-2 generator also contributed to the results for the quarter. Ortho Clinical Diagnostics grew 3.1% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter, with sales in the U.S. up 1.4%, and sales outside the U.S. up 4.8% operationally. Sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of the VITROS 5600 platform, partially offset by lower donor screening sales. ","Rounding up the review of the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care business achieved operational sales growth of 5.8% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 0.9%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 8.2% on an operational basis. Double-digit growth in both daily lenses and astigmatism lenses were partially offset by softer sales of reusable lenses. ","That completes highlights for the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter of 2011. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce Bill Weldon. Bill?","William C. Weldon","Thanks, Louise, and thank you all for being here today. Let me start by saying I'm very pleased to be here with you to share our latest business results, discuss the way we are shaping and leading the future of healthcare. Thanks to the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our people, we are better positioned today than in any time in recent history to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders and meaningful innovations for our patients and customers. After 2 challenging years, I am proud to say Johnson & Johnson returned to delivering sales growth in 2011, and we grew adjusted earnings for the 28th consecutive year. We continue to strengthen our platform for leadership and profitable growth through new product launches, strong pipelines and investments in key growth areas. Though we continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions, our ongoing investments have us well positioned to grow and increase our market leadership in one of the most important and rewarding industries in the world. Today I'll begin by discussing our business highlights for 2011, then I'll review the state of the global healthcare market and discuss 3 major strategies for delivering sustainable growth to Johnson & Johnson.","As our theme this year suggests, we are talking about how Johnson & Johnson is delivering sustainable growth built by meaningful innovations in healthcare. All the work we do is focused on making a difference to people, patients and customers in a personal way, and that's what our credo has reminded us for decades. From the breakthrough of prostate cancer drug that extends a grandfather's life, to the new replacement that brings the joy of walking and exercise back to someone's mother, to the newest soap and shampoo that make bath time a memorable moment for someone's child; these are all meaningful innovations to our patients and customers, and this year's product launches and approvals are a powerful reminder of that mission. ","When I talked to you in recent years, we have been clear about the opportunities and challenges we saw in the market and how our company was positioned to shape and address them. Several years ago, we started on a journey. We set out to build on the strong foundation at Johnson & Johnson and sustain our track record of growth, even as we prepared to address the patent expirations and market issues that we can foresee. We updated you on our enterprise strategy and how our market leadership was expanding in many core businesses and the progress we were making in new growth markets and geographies. We understood that in such a dynamic, global and highly regulated industry as healthcare, there would always be new issues, increasing competition and rapidly evolving economic conditions to contend with. Some we could predict, like the major patent expirations for RISPERDAL and TOPAMAX, with combined peak year sales of over $6 billion. ","Others could not be as easily foreseen, like the severe economic decline, the tightening of consumer spending and healthcare budgets, unexpected challenges with our ESA, DePuy ASR and drug-eluting stent products, as well as quality issues at McNeill. At this point in our history, I am especially excited and energized because we have turned the quarter on a particularly difficult period for our company. The headwinds from patent expirations, portfolio choices and OTC quality issues I have mentioned are being or have been addressed. At the same time, we are focused on significant unmet healthcare needs with innovations that could improve the lives of millions of people. Our pipelines are converting into new products and moving into the market with excellent results. And our ongoing investments in emerging markets are driving growth. Throughout this journey, our management team and employees have taken critical actions to preserve the core values and strengths of our business, while continuing to focus on the long-term health of the company and its ability to serve its shareholders.","We continue to invest in R&D, nearly $37 billion over the last 5 years. This produced 9 major approvals for new pharmaceutical products in the U.S., and many other exciting innovations across our other businesses. Products like STELARA and SIMPONI in immunology, PREZISTA and INTELENCE in HIV, ZYTIGA in oncology, combined with constant innovation and important medical device and consumer platforms such as contact lenses, electrophysiology, advanced energy, biosurgicals, oral care and skin care. We have replenished or advanced our pipelines with exciting new compounds and technologies like the Fibrin Pad for hemostasis, Canagliflozin for diabetes, and bapineuzumab for Alzheimer's disease. ","We also made necessary restructurings to our business to manage our cost structure, simplify our operations and ensure the most efficient use of our capital for the long-term benefit of patients and shareholders. With our focus on financial discipline, the capital -- debt capital has been returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. It has also been used for important long-term investments and strategic alliances and acquisitions like Pfizer Consumer Healthcare and Dabao Consumer business, Crucell and Elon in our Pharmaceuticals business and the pending acquisition of Synthes in the Medical Devices & Diagnostics business. ","Manufacturing issues and recalls have been a serious disappointment for all of us. But through it all, we have remained committed to retaining the trust of our patients and customers. We have taken responsibility and instituted new measures to ensure that our products live up to the high-quality standards that our customers expect and deserve. When I look back at how we phased into this period of industry and global change and how we have managed, I'm very proud of the people at Johnson & Johnson. They have shown the ingenuity, resiliency, tenacity, integrity and compassion that you would expect of a global leader in human healthcare as part of our DNA and a testament to the 125-year heritage that we celebrated this past year. The fruits of these efforts are now being born out, and I feel very good about where we are and where we're going. Now let me focus on 2011, and the most recent highlights.","For the year we delivered solid financial results, we saw a 13% increase in operational growth in emerging markets, we generated significant free cash flow while maintaining a AAA credit rating, we invested more than $7.5 billion in R&D and advanced robust pipelines across all 3 segments of our business, we maintained a disciplined approach to portfolio management, we also dealt with difficult issues in a responsible manner by resolving certain litigation matters and addressing the McNeil consumer recalls. We maintained our focus on market leadership, especially in high-growth areas, with new products and innovations, and as the global economy and market conditions improve, we are well positioned for long-term growth. ","As you can see here, our sales for 2011 increased by 5.6%, 2.8% operationally, reflecting the strength of our new product launches in our Pharmaceutical business, steady performance across our MD&D franchises, science-based innovation and consumer and strong growth in emerging markets. With our continued focus on financial discipline, our adjusted earnings were $13.9 billion and adjusted EPS was $5 or 5% increase. We also generated significant free cash flow of approximately $11.4 billion. Thanks to our financial discipline and the people of Johnson & Johnson, we extended our track record of adjusted earnings increase to 28 years. We also had 49 consecutive years of dividend increases, making us 1 of only 5 companies in the S&P 100 to achieve that record.","In 2011, we strengthened our portfolios and leadership positions in many areas like immunology, oncology, surgical devices and emerging markets. And we used our focus on scientific innovations to maintain or build share in other key growth markets. These innovations addressed clear patient and customer needs. In fact, approximately 70% of our sales are from products with #1 or #2 global market share positions, and approximately 1\/4 of our sales last year came from new products that were introduced in the past 5 years. We remain leaders in important healthcare markets with a focus on meaningful innovations for patients and customers. ","Solid and consistent returns to shareholders have been a hallmark of Johnson & Johnson. Founded in 1886 and with 67 years of being publicly traded, Johnson & Johnson has been through its share of short-term economic and business challenges. And yet with the long-term management focus, we have remained a solid investment choice for decades. During 2011, we generated a one-year total return -- shareholder return of nearly 10%, exceeding the S&P 500 and Dow Jones index and over longer time frames, we continue to compare favorably to those indices. ","Now let me take a deeper dive in our 3 business segments and 2011 results. Pharmaceuticals generated $24.4 billion or 37% of our total sales. It had strong operational growth of 6.2%, driven by recently launched products like STELARA, SIMPONI, ZYTIGA, INCIVO and INVEGA SUSTENNA. Meanwhile Medical Devices & Diagnostics, our largest segment, generated $25.8 billion or 40% of our total. It had operational growth of just under 2%. And Consumer generated $14.9 billion in revenue or 23% of our total, and saw a modest operational decline due to the McNeil recalls and continued softening in the general economy. Operating profit for 2011 excluding special items was $18.3 billion, an increase of $700 million over the prior year. As a percent of sales, operating profit was a 28.2%, a modest decline due primarily to ongoing remediation activities in the OTC business.","In Johnson & Johnson, we have 3 very different but complementary stories going on in our business segments this year which speak to the unique strength of our broad-based and healthcare. Our Pharmaceuticals business is resurgent. We have gotten beyond the most significant patent expirations for our business and are poised to accelerate growth, thanks to our recent product launches in one of the strongest pipelines in the industry. With $24 billion in sales, we are the 8th largest pharmaceuticals business in the world and the 6th largest biotech business as part of that. Excluding the impact of generic competition as well as recent acquisitions and divestitures, our operation sales growth would have been 7%. ","Through 2011, we built on the continued success of recently introduced products, which put our business back into a strong growth trajectory and continued to strengthen our leadership position in core therapeutic areas like immunology, infectious disease and oncology. And when you look at the combined sales of new products launched between 2009 and 2011, Johnson & Johnson is leading the U.S. in new pharmaceutical product sales. We also strengthened our immunology leadership and sales in emerging markets by amending our global distribution agreement with Merck on our largest selling products, REMICADE and SIMPONI. ","In terms of pipeline progress in 2011, we were the U.S. leader in new molecular entity approvals with 3; ZYTIGA in oncology, XARELTO in cardiovascular disease and EDURANT in HIV. We also received approval of INCIVO in Europe for hepatitis C, which is marketed by our strategic partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals in the United States. We also completed the acquisition of Crucell to stake out a key leadership position in vaccines, and we continue to seek out new collaborations with companies like Pharmacyclics, where we'll jointly develop and market an anticancer compound focused on building our strength in oncology.","All this progress in the Pharmaceuticals business is the result of our commitment to continue investing in product launches and the pipeline even as the business faced many challenges. We have been transforming our portfolio of pharmaceutical products to reduce the past reliance on more mature products and staying focused on differentiated medicines in 5 therapeutic areas. On this slide, you'll see how we expect that portfolio to increasingly and significantly consist of the most recently launched and core growth products creating a more balanced, healthier and revitalized portfolio. We are also in a more favorable competitive position with many significant patent expirations behind us. The impact on our sales over the next few years from patent expirations will be less than that of our major competitors. This transformation and positioning has us feeling very good about our Pharmaceuticals business. ","Meanwhile, Medical Devices & Diagnostics is continuing to strengthen its global capabilities and pipelines during a more challenging slower growth period by investing in key growth businesses and emerging markets. With $26 billion in sales, MD&D remains the largest medical device business in the world. Excluding the sales of drug-eluting stents which we exited at the end of 2011, operational sales growth was a healthy 3% when considering the economic and pricing pressures in these markets.","Meanwhile, the current challenges in several MD&D markets, as well as our own issues with the DePuy ASR hip have been well documented. Eastern austerity measures -- European austerity measures, pricing pressures and a slowdown in elective surgeries have all contributed to more tempered growth rates. Despite these challenges, our MD&D businesses are competing well in a market that has undergone dynamic change. In 2011, MD&D showed strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. We introduced many innovative products, for example in Asia-Pacific and Europe, we have been rolling out one-day ACUVUE MOIST for astigmatism. We've also continued the global expansion of our highly accurate OneTouch Verio blood glucose-monitoring platform for diabetes patients. The OneTouch Verio system, which was introduced in Canada last September, has just been launched in the U.S. this month and we plan to launch it globally in the near future. We continue to advance breakthrough products through the regulatory process. In fact, 75% of the MD&D pipeline advanced to its next major milestone in 2011. Breakthroughs like SEDASYS, the first computer-assisted personalized sedation system, and the Fibrin Pad are progressing with the FDA. And we are increasing investments in emerging markets with recently opened innovation centers in India and China, while continuing to support dozens of training institutes around the world.","With these actions and others, MD&D has been able to sustain #1 or #2 leadership positions in 80% of our key platforms, while growing or maintaining share in the majority of these. We've also made some very important portfolio decisions in this segment. For example, we decided to refocus our Cardiovascular business by exiting the drug-eluting stent business and shifting investments to higher growth, higher need areas like electrophysiology. These are important decisions to fund growth potential in other promising areas. Decisions to acquire Synthes and strengthen our leadership position in orthopedics, as well as our acquisition of SterilMed for its expertise in reprocessing surgical instruments speaks to how we are consistently and continuously looking across our business for the best long-term growth opportunities. ","To better serve a market that has been undergoing dramatic change, the MD&D segment began reorganizing into 3 more integrated and agile businesses at the end of November. In brief, the MD&D segment will now be managed as 3 global business groups, which you can see on the slide, the Global Surgery Group, the Global Medical Solutions Group, and the Global Orthopedics Group, which will be further strengthened upon the completion of the Synthes acquisition. These changes will help increase our focus on strategic areas for growth and address unique customer needs at a time of tremendous change in the industry. The groups will cease -- create globally integrated business units, increase the quality, speed and flexibility of our decision making and leverage our scale in many markets around the world by making greater use of shared services and centers of excellence.","Finally, our Consumer segment continues to innovate with new products, business models and a growing presence in emerging markets, while getting its OTC business back in shape, relaunching many of the brands that made the business a global leader. With $15 billion in sales, Consumer is the 6th largest consumer healthcare company in the world. For Consumer, we saw an operational sales decline of just under 1%, given the remediation and supply issues associated with our U.S. OTC business. Excluding OTC acquisitions and divestitures, the Consumer segment grew about 2% operationally. Our Consumer business saw solid growth in certain franchises like skin care and oral care, with strong performances from the NEUTROGENA and LISTERINE mouthwash brands. Our Consumer Group also continued expanding into emerging markets with the acquisition of J B Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals in Russia. We also continued to innovate, introducing NEUTROGENA Naturals, AVEENO Smart Essentials, NICORETTE Quick Mist and LISTERINE ZERO.","Given our proven ability to build on a stable of iconic consumer brands and deliver science-based innovation, along with the restoration of supply of some of our OTC products, we feel positive about where our Consumer business is headed in 2012. ","A big part of our consumer story in 2011 and going into 2012 has been the recovery and remediation of McNeil Consumer Healthcare business. And let me provide a brief update. We've achieved all major commitments to date under our Consent Decree with the FDA, and are working closely with FDA officials to ensure we can get high-quality products back to our loyal customers who need them. Several key products have returned to the market, such as TYLENOL severe cold caplets and certain children's and infant's TYLENOL brands. We expect volumes will continue to ramp up and anticipate key products will continue being reintroduced throughout 2012. ","We've also been focused on how we can improve the products we are bringing back. In 2011, we introduced new flow restrictor packaging to the industry for children's medicine. We have instituted new dosing instructions for certain TYLENOL products to help ensure safe and appropriate use of our medicines. And we are also in the process of rebuilding Fort Washington into a state-of-art manufacturing facility which we anticipate opening next year. We will continue to invest in market support as we deliver a steady supply of our OTC brands back into the market.","Now let me spend the rest of my time addressing some of the economic and healthcare market questions on your mind and why Johnson & Johnson is well positioned as a global leader in healthcare. When I think about the world today, there are 3 major forces that are shaping healthcare -- the healthcare environment: Macroeconomic conditions; government payers and regulators; and industry trends. Macroeconomic conditions have been incredibly challenging the last several years, but opportunities remain. Slowing economic growth, the uncertainty in financial markets, high unemployment and pressure in healthcare costs have all contributed to constraints on healthcare spending, and the volatility of currency exchange rates continues to be an issue. But these economic dynamics are balanced by positive demographic trends creating demand. Populations in the developed world are aging rapidly and we consume more healthcare as we grow older. In fact, those over the age of 65 consume an average of 7x more healthcare per year than those under that age. Global expansion and growth, even at less explosive rates than a few years ago, also leads to growing demand for healthcare, especially in emerging markets where access has been its historically low. Our investments continue to be in line with these market opportunities. ","Government is another important force to consider. As healthcare reform evolves around the world, it will remain critical to identify those opportunities where we can make the most important differences for patients, customers and payers. Government payers are requiring more cost-effective solutions to address their citizens' health issues and that impacts the pricing of healthcare products and services. We recognize these priorities and are making investments in new and productive areas. Personalized medicine and companion diagnostics, especially in the areas of oncology and antipsychotics are geared toward how we can better target treatments, monitor results and be more efficient in product development. The regulatory environment has also become much more intense in its scrutiny of new products. We share a common goal with regulators of wanting to save lives, ease people's suffering and address unmet medical needs with meaningful innovations. As a result, we support strong regulatory environments that ensure patient safety, while also ensuring that the fast and efficient approval of potentially life-saving medicines and treatments.","Finally, industry forces are also at play in many ways. In this is highly competitive world, bringing new innovations to market requires significant investments, access to the best minds and talents and adaptability to ever changing markets. In this environment, it is more important than ever for companies to be agile, collaborative and able to drive the new business models. In our business we have always looked to complement our organic development with acquisitions and collaborations that help us gain new capabilities or provide access to technology, products and compounds that we can accelerate to the market. The acquisition of SterilMed or collaborations in Alzheimer's disease with Elan and Pfizer and in HIV with Gilead Sciences are just a few promising ventures. Amidst all of the forces I've mentioned, healthcare remains compelling and growing market. Over the past 5 years, the global healthcare market has had compounded annual growth of nearly 7%, and it should continue to see strong mid single-digit growth over the next 5 years. And growth in the emerging markets will be double-digits as those economies continue expanding.","We continue investing in growth opportunities to expand our market leadership positions in areas like orthopedics with the pending acquisition of Synthes, and to pursue new opportunities in some of the fastest growing segments of healthcare like vaccines with the acquisition of Crucell, and in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China. We also continue to invest in addressing major unmet medical needs. When you look at the projected growth of global diseases over the next 15-year period, you see that significant unmet medical needs remain. Cancers, mental health disorders, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV are all among the most significant diseases and they are markets where we either have leadership today or increasing investments to gain leadership. ","Increased globalization continues to present healthcare opportunities as well. Healthcare spending often tracks with the growth of GDP. As nations have more money to spend, they address their citizens' most essential needs, including the need for affordable quality healthcare. Emerging markets are projected to grow their share of global GDP from 36% in 1980 to 57% in the year 2020. Meanwhile over the projection period of 2010 to 2020, 35% of the growth in healthcare spending will be coming from emerging markets. This trend will increase the emerging markets' influence on healthcare and improve their ability to address a significant need for affordable quality healthcare in their countries. But we can't dismiss developed markets which will remain powerful, accounting for 7x per capita spending on healthcare than in the emerging markets. To remain competitive, we must win in both emerging and developed markets. ","Finally, there are numerous exciting new healthcare technologies that could have significant potential in the future, opening up new business for breakthrough innovations. They require significant investments, talented people and more nimble approach to innovation, advantages and traits where Johnson & Johnson has a proven track record. Even as the global economy remains challenging, these demographic trends, technical innovations and the need for increased access to better healthcare make this space a sustainable growth opportunity and a fulfilling mission for our people. ","In the world I just described, Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to address these market opportunities for 3 clear reasons: The first has to do with the ways we are delivering meaningful innovations to patients and customers; the second has to do with the steps we have taken to build a more agile company; and the third is our commitment to the operating model and values that have enabled us to succeed for decades. As I've said today, we are committed to innovations that will make a difference to patients and customers in a meaningful and personal way. We never want to forget that.","We have learned that there are many different paths to achieve meaningful innovation. As we seek to address unmet needs, we recognize that there are no easy answers and few straightforward approaches. The power of our model comes from our ability to select from the incredible resources we have at our disposal; from people, to capital, to technology and beyond, in order to create breakthrough innovation and bring it to market. The first step we take is to identify the significant unmet need and market opportunity where we believe Johnson & Johnson can make a meaningful difference for patients. We look for areas where we have capabilities, insights and unique advantages that can shape the opportunity. Then we take an agnostic approach to find the latest science and research to address these needs. In addition to our internal R&D, we use strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, acquisitions and venture capital investments to give us insight and access to the next breakthroughs. And finally, we leverage the breadth of our resources in development, supply chain, marketing and sales to bring these innovative products to the market. Let me give you a few examples. With diseases like hepatitis C, Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease, our Pharmaceuticals business has followed this model. Hepatitis C, for example, infects about 170 million people worldwide. In this case, we partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals on the development of telaprevir, which was approved in 2011 and is now being marketed as INCIVO in Europe. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, we developed a very unique collaboration model with Elan and Pfizer in 2010 to gain access to bapineuzumab. We have seen excellent progress in the research being conducted around this compound, which has the potential to be the first disease-modifying agent that will alter the progression of this devastating disease. And in the case of cardiovascular disease, we partnered with Bayer on the development and launch of XARELTO, one of the industry's most highly anticipated launches. It is currently approved for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and knee or hip replacement surgery, and for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. ","In other cases, we may choose an acquisition to broaden our portfolio with the new capability or to gain entry into a new piece of the market with the technology we don't have in our own pipeline. This was the case when we acquired Micrus Endovascular in 2010 to strengthen our long-standing neurovascular business. Micrus was developing a breakthrough technology in ischemic stroke, the type that accounts for 90% of the strokes that occur each year in an area where we did not have a competing product. The REVIVE SE for Micrus was approved in February of 2011 in the European Union and has become an important new option in the treatment of ischemic stroke, thanks to the advantages over more standard treatments. ","In other cases, we might be better able to accelerate a product's development through our internal capabilities and global scale as part of Johnson & Johnson as with ZYTIGA, which resulted from the acquisition of Cougar Biotechnology. Here, we were able to apply our clinical trial expertise to bring ZYTIGA through approval and market at a remarkably accelerated rate, and we continue to pursue additional development programs in oncology with ZYTIGA. ","In the case of the Fibrin Pad, we started out as a strategic partner with Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, working on biologic combination of products designed to solve unmet medical needs in the area of surgical bleeding. As the collaboration developed, we determined that an acquisition would allow us to better manage the complex development and intricate regulatory filings necessary to achieve the success of this convergent breakthrough product, which is anxiously awaited by surgeons. ","Another approach we take to drive meaningful innovation is to use our broad base of businesses and expertise to tackle a disease state on multiple fronts. For example, there are more than 285 million people worldwide with diabetes. It is one prevalent disease where several Johnson & Johnson businesses are able to work to make a meaningful difference in people's lives. From our Diabetes Care franchise, we provide industry-leading devices such as blood glucose monitors including the OneTouch Verio, and insulin pumps such as the waterproof Animas Vibe, which was introduced in the European Union in 2011. And we are heavily involved in efforts to develop an artificial pancreas to further advance the treatment of diabetes. ","Meanwhile, our Pharmaceuticals business is developing a new drug for treatment of diabetes called Canagliflozin. This is an oral, once-a-day agent with a potential for good tolerability, meaningful weight reduction, and a low risk of hypoglycemia. Canagliflozin was discovered with our strategic partner Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceuticals and is now in full Phase III development.","And finally in Consumer, our Wellness & Prevention business and nutritional products such as SPLENDA can help diabetes patients and other consumers achieve healthier living. Market insights, knowledgeable sharing and collaboration amongst our business partners make us powerful partners across Johnson & Johnson to fight against diseases and other diseases through meaningful innovation. But just as important as the way we innovate is the way we operate. We have spent a great deal of management attention in recent years on building a more agile and responsive Johnson & Johnson. We have focused on improving our operations to reflect our commitment to delivering high-quality products and to adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace I described earlier. This environment demands an agile organization; structures that are streamlined and can adapt quickly, crisp market strategies and discipline portfolio management and talented nimble leadership that can apply lessons from various industries and geographies to their businesses. Let me share a few examples of what we have been doing to become more agile.","Two years ago, we spoke to you about work we were doing to build a new enterprise supply chain model; no small task for a traditionally decentralized enterprise with more than 250 operating companies. Our objective was and is to reduce complexity and redundancies throughout our global supply chain so our companies can consistently produce high-quality products and maintain reliable supply. Today, we are achieving our near-term objectives of making good strides in the manufacturing and quality areas. In fact, we're trending ahead of our original internal projections, with our goal of significantly reducing the number of suppliers and external manufacturers while improving quality. We are also making headway in driving tighter integration in our quality systems across the enterprise. Our efforts in this area are already paying off with better inspection records despite an increase in regulatory activity.","I also spoke to you earlier about the exciting new medicines coming out of our pharmaceutical pipeline. While I'm proud that our pipeline is recognized as one of the best in the industry, I'm also proud of the productive way we are achieving these results. For the last several years, we have been prioritizing investments across our portfolio, investing in L&A activities that are closely aligned with our therapeutic area of strategy and we have shown great improvements in R&D productivity metrics. Specifically, our latest development in M&A success rate for Phase III development and registration has been trending around 75%, well above the industry mean of 50% to 55%.","We continue to rank among the top 1\/3 of our peers in overall development cycle times, and we have dramatically improved our submission cycle times while maintaining quality, resulting in a cost per NME approved that is well below the industry mean. Finally, we provide -- we continue to approach our portfolio management in a disciplined fashion, getting assets in businesses that can provide us with new capabilities and access to growth in fast-growing markets, and divesting assets that either aren't aligned to our future focus or where the market expectations and our competitive positioning have changed dramatically, such as the case of drug-eluting stents. ","Beyond the meaningful innovations and our agility, the foundation of our decades of sustained growth remains an unwavering commitment to Johnson & Johnson's operating model and values. It all starts with our people, who live and embody the values expressed in Our Credo day in and day out. Our Credo was established in 1943, and it provides a common set of values that hold together our 118,000 employees in 60 countries and more than 250 operating companies. The 4 tenets of Our Credo provide a clear focus and mindset for how we approach each decision; patients and customers first, then our employees, our communities and our shareholders. The last few years have offered significant challenges, but our commitment to Our Credo has remained the foundation of our response. It encouraged us to respond swiftly, intentionally and vigorously to any situations where we were falling short of our commitment to patients and customers. ","In addition to Our Credo, we also work under an operating model that has served us well for decades; being broadly based in human healthcare, managing for the long-term, taking a decentralized management approach and focusing on people and values. Our broad base in healthcare has proven its value quite clearly in recent years. The strength of the enterprise has enabled us to continue investing our capital, talent and technology in the right places during challenging economic times, even when business cycles in one company or segment might have made such investments impossible if they were on their own.","We are also focused on 4 growth enablers: high-quality innovative products, robust pipelines, global presence and talented people, which support our model and allow our businesses to achieve sustainable, compliant growth. The success of this model relies on all of these elements working in concert across the company. But most importantly, it relies on the talented people of Johnson & Johnson. The strength and depth of talent at Johnson & Johnson is a result of an investment we make in our people, their sense of duty to the tenets of Our Credo and our ability to attract, retain and reward them with challenging opportunities, a supportive environment, competitive compensation and a fulfilling mission to improve people's lives through our products, services and corporate contributions. We invest more and more each year in the development of our people, and we're fortunate to have the most talented and dedicated team in the world. ","In summary, I described for you today how we differentiate Johnson & Johnson as a leader in the global healthcare market. It has to do with delivering meaningful innovations to patients and customers, building a more agile business that can seize new market opportunities and remaining committed to a proven operating model and set of values. In our journey over the past 5 years, we have made extraordinary progress. We've adapted well to both foreseen and unforeseen challenges. We've launched new products that are strengthening our market leadership and provide a healthy platform for the long-term. We advanced our pipelines, which are among the best in the industry. We've maintained a disciplined approach to our investments in growth and portfolio management decisions. We stayed true to our operating model and values and we are poised to deliver sustainable growth built on meaningful innovations in healthcare. ","In 2012, we expect to continue this journey by accelerating our operational sales growth, including the reintroduction of our major OTC products, by advancing meaningful innovations into the market and sustaining the strong momentum in our pipelines and by expanding our global presence and reach with continued investments in emerging markets and the seamless integration of Synthes. In the last 5 years, I've never felt better about our business coming out of one year and going into the next. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout the year. Thank you. ","And now I'd like to turn it over to Dominic.","Dominic J. Caruso","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some comments on our 2011 fourth quarter and full year results, as well as provide guidance for you to consider in updating your models for 2012. As Bill said at the beginning of his presentation, it is a great pleasure to report performance that showed a return to sales growth, as well as an increase in adjusted earnings for the 28th consecutive year. ","At the beginning of 2011, we provided you with an outlook of our financial performance for the year that would be impacted by several factors. Specifically, we indicated that net income margins would contract by more than 0.5% versus 2010, partly due to an expected increase in our effective tax rate and partly due to a contraction in our pretax operating margins. As we discussed throughout the year, the margin impact was due to the dilutive impact of the Crucell acquisition, the continued and incremental pricing pressure across our businesses, the incremental cost associated with the U.S. Healthcare Reform fee, as well as the incremental cost of remediation activities in our McNeil Consumer Healthcare business. ","We also continued investing across our businesses for sustainable growth, including the launch of new exciting products as well as the continued strengthening of our pipeline, all of which as we expected resulted in margin contraction. Over the course of the year, however, we managed to contain the margin erosion to less than 0.5% for the year, an improvement over our forecast. We did complete several divestitures throughout the year and some were completed in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a higher level of other income than our most recent guidance. Additionally, we implemented some tax planning strategies late in the year, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for the year. ","As we have historically done, we take the opportunity to redeploy these types of gains to investments in growth areas for our business. This was certainly the case in the fourth quarter, where we incurred higher R&D expenses primarily related to the collaboration agreement with Pharmacyclics for the development of an important oncology compound.  As we previously announced, we expected this agreement to be approximately $0.04 to $0.05 dilutive to our earnings per share. The gains resulting from the divestitures as well as the lower tax rate were partly invested in the business such as the Pharmacyclics collaboration agreement as well as other important investments, with the balance resulting in higher earnings per share than we expected in the quarter. ","During the fourth quarter, we also recorded several special items. These special items amounted to approximately $3.3 billion on a pretax basis and consist of the following. First, we recorded costs associated with ongoing litigation primarily related to RISPERDAL. Additionally, we increased our accrual for product liability costs primarily related to the DePuy ASR Hip recall. As we disclosed previously, changes to the accrual may be required as additional information becomes available. We have recently completed an analysis of new information, including recently updated revision rates for the recalled products, and we have updated our estimates with respect to potential costs associated with this recall. Consistent with this new information, we also increased the accrual for costs associated with the DePuy ASR Hip recall program, where we are committed to working with patients and their health insurers to address medical costs directly associated with the recall. ","And finally, we also adjusted the value of the currency option we entered into in connection with the pending Synthes transaction to reflect the changes in currency exchange rates for the Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar. Together, these special items reduced our fourth quarter results by $1.05 per share. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates for the quarter as published by FirstCall by $0.04 per share. ","To wrap up our formal presentation this morning, I would like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2012. Please note that this guidance does not include the impact of Synthes, as the acquisition has not yet been completed. Consistent with our historical practice concerning acquisitions, we will include the impact of Synthes after we close the transaction. As many of you have asked about the treatment of the amortization of intangible assets related to this transaction, I would like to confirm that consistent with our historical practice we will be including the incremental amortization expense in our guidance that we updated to reflect the impact of this transaction. We will, of course, highlight the amount for you in our guidance that we provide once the transaction has been completed. ","First let me set some context around certain items that are reflected in my guidance, but may not yet be fully reflected in your models. The U.S. dollar has strengthened versus many currencies since the last time we spoke in October, specifically about 8% versus the euro. In looking at your models, it appears that most of your models have not yet been updated for this impact. Additionally, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in 2012 at a slightly higher level than 2011 as we continue to address the manufacturing quality issues related to the OTC recalls and work to restore our McNeil Consumer Healthcare products in the marketplace. ","And as you have seen in several markets, we have experienced pricing pressure in 2011, and we expect that this pressure will continue in 2012. This pricing pressure is expected to negatively impact our pretax operating margin for 2012 by approximately 0.5% to 1%, a greater impact than we saw in 2011. As we plan for 2012, we also want to ensure that we make the proper investments to continue the sustainability of the underlying strength we see in the business while we continue to deal with these challenges. I am pleased that given the strength of the underlying growth in our business, driven primarily by the launch of our new products, we do expect the pretax operating margins will improve in 2012 over 2011 levels and I'll provide some more insight on this in just a few minutes.","Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of 2011, we had approximately $12.6 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $32.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $19.6 billion of debt. This is an improvement of $1.7 billion in our overall net cash position from year-end 2010. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $500 million and $550 million. ","Turning to other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation and divestitures, asset sales or write-offs. As we are likely to complete a divestiture very early in 2012, we have included the impact of that transaction in this guidance. This account is difficult to forecast, but we will be comfortable with your models for 2012 reflecting other income and expense as a net gain, ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion or a lower level than we saw in 2011. ","And now a word on taxes. For 2011, the company's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 20.1%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2012 in the range of 21% to 22%. This effective tax rate for 2012 includes an assumption that the federal R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress and reflects changes in the mix of our business. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year.","Now turning to sales and earnings. As we have done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2012 with the impact that currency exchange rates could have. As we have done in the past, we will use the euro as an example of the overall impact that currency fluctuations could have. And as of the end of last week, the euro was at $1.29 and has weakened from an average of $1.39, along with other major currencies versus 2011 levels.","Turning to sales. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 4% and 5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2012 on a constant currency basis of approximately $67.7 billion to $68.3 billion. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements but as an example, to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales of currency exchange rates for all of 2012 were to remain where they were as of the end of last week, then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 3%. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to range between just over 1% and 2% for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $66 billion to $66.5 billion. ","Now turning to earnings. We suggest you consider full year 2012 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.18 and $5.28 per share on an operational basis or a growth rate of between 3.5% and 5.5% on a constant currency basis. While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates for all of 2012 were to remain where they were as of the end of last week, then our reported EPS excluding special items would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.13 per share due to exchange rate fluctuations. We therefore suggest you model our reported EPS excluding special items in the range between $5.05 and $5.15 per share. And at this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of that range. ","So in summary, let me add a few final comments for you to consider as you update your models. The midpoint of our operational or constant currency guidance of $68 billion in sales growing at around 4.5% and $5.23 of earnings per share excluding special items growing at a similar rate, appear to be consistent with most of the analysts' models. As I noted earlier, it appears that most of those models have not yet been updated for the recent major change in currency exchange rates, and therefore those models appear to be based on exchange rates similar to what we saw in 2011. We would expect that with the guidance we provided, most models will be updated with this expected impact of currency. ","Also, as you update your models for the year, you may want to consider that the growth rate comparisons in the first half of the year will be tougher than the second half of the year because, as a reminder, LEVAQUIN and CONCERTA began to see generic competition in the middle of 2011. Finally, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you should see that our overall net income margin is expected to be approximately the same as in 2011. However, you should also see that we expect pretax operating margins to be much healthier, increasing from 2011 levels by approximately 100 to 150 basis points. This pretax operating margin improvement reflects improved leverage across all operating expenses. This will, however, be offset by lower other income and a slightly higher tax rate than we saw in 2011. ","In closing, we're very pleased with our overall results for 2011 and we expect the growth in momentum to continue into 2012. And while we do not see a significantly improved macro landscape in 2012, we do feel very positive about the underlying strength in our business as evidenced by strong core products, exciting new product launches, robust pipelines and extraordinary global expansion opportunities. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. ","And now Louise, back to you.","Louise Mehrotra","We will now open the meeting to questions. As we have Bill Weldon with us today, we would appreciate it if you could keep your questions at the strategic level and please wait for the microphone as we are webcasting this meeting. Over here, Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan. I'll start with financials. Dominic, just to clarify. On that other income guidance, you commented before that the quarterly run rate of other income, all the different things [ph] for the pluses and minuses that occurs is going to be about $100 million a quarter, so about $400 million a year. I think you commented on that in one of the earnings calls earlier in 2011. You're guiding to $1 billion of other income, so it looks like you're assuming some gains in 2012. Can you just give us the visibility into what gains you're assuming will occur in 2012 so we can model this correctly?","Dominic J. Caruso","Right. So just to clarify, we think that the underlying run rate in that account approximates $500 million to $600 million. It's royalty income and some other gains, so think about $500 million to $600 million that we expect early this year as we continue to adjust our portfolio and redeploy investments. That will have a divestiture that we record early in 2011 resulting in this now increased to a level of between $900 million and $1 billion. I can't comment on the specific divestiture we're referring to, but we expect to complete it early in 2012.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Bill, let me ask you about 2 pipeline areas. A big driver in 2012 is going to be INCIVO, telaprevir, for the company. The landscape for HCV has changed a lot in the last 6 to 12 months. Obviously, there's a lot of competition for assets right now. Can you just talk about, given how important that's going to become to the company as a revenue contributor in 2012 and '13, how you're viewing the competitive positioning of J&J going forward in that area because it becomes an important area for you? And then the second one I'd like to comment on is on Bapi. We're going to get the readout on 2 of the North American trials in 2012. You mentioned in your slides, potential filing in '12, '13. Is that your expectation in how you are positioning? How do you want us to think about potential for the Bapi data in '12, '13? Should we be assuming that this is going to file in '12, '13 on the data that you're going to be generating?","William C. Weldon","Yes, the Bapi one I'll answer first, Mike. Yes, we expect that we'll have the data analyzed and we'll be filing obviously on a positive outcome by the end of the year would be our expectation on Bapi. And then when you go to INCIVO in the hepatitis C, that's an area where there's a whole lot of interest in various areas. There's a Pharmasset acquisition that's taking place and others. We feel really good about where we are with INCIVO. We feel very good about 435, which will be a complementary product. And we feel that we'll be able to get out there and work in the hepatitis C area with those compounds. And then the other ones that are there, they're still very early in development there. I guess they're going into IIb right now, and we're going to wait and see what exactly happens there. But we think that we're very well positioned for the hepatitis C with the 2 compounds we have.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So in short, you feel you have in-house right now what you need to be competitive in what will be the second wave of new compounds that are coming out?","William C. Weldon","We feel we're in a good position and there may be opportunities to look to the future and see how we could work with others if those nukes become better products.","Louise Mehrotra","Rick?","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Rick Wise, Leerink Swann. Maybe I'll start with Dominic as well, or Bill. Gross margins, you talked about that the margin pressures, the cost pressures. How do we think about gross margin in 2012? Can it be better than 2011? And maybe, Dominic, if you could talk a little bit about what gets you back to the 70% level we've seen in years past. Or are we now more permanently -- given the mix, given the collaborations, are we -- is the upper 60s the new normal for J&J?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. Well the gross margin, of course, is just one aspect of the total P&L. And as I mentioned for 2012, we expect pretax operating margins to improve by 100 to 150 basis points versus '12. And that, as I mentioned, is across every line, R&D, cost of goods sold and selling and marketing expenses. So we do expect gross margins to improve in '12 versus '11. I think the major factors are, as new products are launching and ramping up more rapidly, of course they are contributing more to that line. The mix in the business, the Pharmaceutical business growing obviously has a higher margin component than the rest of the businesses. And also, as the McNeil Consumer products return to the marketplace, compared to 2011 and '10, when they were not basically in the sales, those are relatively high-margin products when compared to the rest of our business so that mix of the business should improve as well. And as Bill mentioned, we're undergoing pretty extensive plan regarding our enterprise supply chain. And although the goal is first always to maintain quality, we obviously think there are some efficiencies in our supply chain. We'll continue to develop those as the years move along. We're early in that process. We've already seen some good improvements. I think we'll see more in the next couple of years.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Bill, one for you. The balance sheet remains incredibly strong, cash continues to grow. We talked about it earlier. The challenge here, given price pressures, given growth pressures, is to bring ever more innovative, faster-growing products in the portfolio. Can you talk a little bit about how you're challenging the J&J team to move faster in these times? Could we -- should we expect J&J to be more aggressive on the acquisition front in 2012 to achieve these goals? Maybe you can talk about your challenges to the team and how you're going to use the cash more aggressively strategically.","William C. Weldon","Yes, a couple of things. I think, as you say, innovation is what's critical to all of us. And I gave you a look at the performance of our R&D organizations, then you look at what's in the pipeline, we're actually -- if you look in the near-term and further out, which we don't talk a lot about, but we feel arguably we have one of the best if not the best pipelines in the industry, talking about pharmaceuticals as well as the others. I think, Rick, as I said earlier, we continue to look for opportunities. The Pharmacyclics, we thought, was an extraordinary opportunity in the oncology area. There's lot of things that we go and look for but as always, we're going to continue to look to make sure we're going to return value to shareholders. And I think if you have the good fortune that we have at this point in time of having a really extraordinary pipeline, we're doing all we can to continue to advance that pipeline and move it forward, as well as looking for other opportunities, whether they're through acquisitions, licenses or collaborations. We'll continue to do that. A lot of these have become extraordinarily expensive. Well you guys have seen them all, and some of them it's hard to justify the prices people are paying. But I think there's a continuing push in our organization to make sure we're making good choices. And I think if you look at the productivity we have of 75% coming out with approvals and even the cost we have in development of these and cycle times, the group's doing an extraordinary job. They're going to keep doing that and they're going to keep looking for the right opportunities where we can bring our resources and others together to get these products in the marketplace. So I think we're going to continue to do what we're doing. We're going to be aggressive. If we see a great opportunity, we're going to go and get it or try and get it. But I think we're in a very good position, but we have to just keep the pressure on to keep looking for what else is there, what are the new opportunities, are they internal, are they external, enter a collaboration or license or an acquisition and to continue to march forward that way. There's no clear-cut answer, I think we have to do everything. I think the strength of J&J and our R&D organization today is they are truly agnostic. They're looking for the best opportunity wherever they exist and then they're absolutely going to try and get it. So it's not embedded here, it's what is the best opportunity, where is it and how do we bring it into J&J and then get it to the market.","Louise Mehrotra","Matt?","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Matt Dodds, Citigroup. Bill, for you first. I think I asked this one a lot in the past. On R&D and pharma, just looking at the growth rate for the year, I assume you're still over 20% of sales in pharma for R&D. And I've kind of been asking when this big part of the recent pipeline gets through, does that number come down? And it doesn't seem like it is. Should we be thinking longer-term that your success is encouraging you to continue to spend above industry average in pharma?","William C. Weldon","Matt, I think we'll spend where the opportunities take us. And that's what we've said all along. We spend more because, and I think you've seen it, the productivity of our pipeline over the last few years has been second to none really. And if you look at the pipeline today, huge opportunities with Bapi, Canagliflozin and these type of opportunities and beyond. So I think we're going to spend what -- we'll deliver those products in the market and spend appropriately. And it maybe that the numbers will be in the relative range they've been in. But there's also the opportunity to come down. But the cost of development of compounds, as you know, is not going backwards. The critical piece of it is the productivity of the pipeline, which is what I talked about earlier, the amount of products that we're able to deliver when we get into Phase III, where your primary cost is or the total cost of the cycle time. So it's planning, it's making sure you're doing good work in getting the product in the market because the most expensive one is the one that never gets there.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then quickly, Dominic, one for you. On the cash, and if we don't consider Synthes as part of this, at what point do you consider repatriating if there's no change in the tax code or tax holiday? Is that something you may be more likely to consider now given the buildup?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, it's a great question, Matt. And of course, we're all hopeful that the corporate tax reform will actually take hold and we already saw some good movement towards a territorial system there. I think we're encouraged by that. I think consistent with the territorial system, which I think what all multinational companies want to remain competitive in a global economy, will be some transition plan with respect to cash that's already outside the U.S. I think we'd rather wait and see and work with our government to develop first the territorial system, and then an appropriate transition plan that makes sense for U.S. taxpayers.","Louise Mehrotra","Tony?","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tony Butler, Barclays Capital. Just 2 questions. The first for Bill, the second for Dominic. Bill, one of the more exciting products, I think, in the pharmaceutical development have been Factor Xa inhibitors, at least replacements for warfarin. The early signs for XARELTO, though, have been really quite poor in AF. And I recognize that a number of other indications are still to come. So I'd love for you to comment on that and maybe why those scripts have been very poor. And then second for Dominic. Dominic, as you think about remediation costs collectively over the next several years, are you actually bringing forward some of those costs now more so into 2012 than you might have done in the past?","William C. Weldon","Yes. I think the XARELTO question actually, there were a lot of borderline warfarin products or COUMADIN for patients that they wanted to get out. And PRADAXA was out in the market first and gained a lot of those products. So what's happened is we've only been in the market a short period of time. We're finding that there is a very -- that the physicians who are using the product are very happy with it and they're starting to look at more and more patients. The thing that's been most encouraging to us is the most recent results we saw, which was the week of January 13. We saw a 21.6% share of patients with new prescription written going on to the XARELTO patients. So we think that physicians are now becoming aware of it. They're looking at the next group of patients that can go on and the failures under PRADAXA, and also if there are potential adverse events. I think there's a kind of a halo, if you want to call it, a negative halo, around all of these products that I think will play itself out over time. But we're actually very encouraged by the most recent results we've seen.","Dominic J. Caruso","Tony, with respect to remediation costs, I'm going to assume you're referring to the McNeil Consumer Healthcare. We said that in '12, we expected slightly higher level of remediation costs than in '11. But it's not because we're advancing them more into '12 for future years. It's really just progress being made under the Consent Decree and the actions we're committed to take along with the FDA. So there's no shifting of those expenses. It's the normal course, we obviously want to do all of the things in the appropriate manner under the Consent Decree, but there's no shifting of expenses.","Louise Mehrotra","Rajeev?","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rajeev Jashnani, UBS. I had a question regarding the pricing impact on margins that you talked about, 50 to 100 basis points. Is that something you're anticipating to sort of continue into perpetuity? And maybe if you could talk about how you plan to sustain margins in the face of that potential and on an ongoing basis.","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, Rajeev. Of course, perpetuity is a very long time, so I can't really comment on perpetuity.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe intermediate.","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. So for 2012, one thing that's happening that's more incremental versus '11 is that in Japan, you may know that pharmaceutical pricing reductions have been on a sort of biannual basis. So 2012 in Japan, our business will experience much greater pricing decline than they saw the previous year because of that anniversary. Of course that will then change in '13, and then we'll see it again in '14. And then also, we do expect that the European austerity measures and the pressure in Europe will continue to cause pressure in pricing in 2012 to a greater extent than we saw in 2011. I really can't comment any further on what may happen as those economies improve. But one thing I'm sure you'll appreciate, I think that as we develop innovative products that are important to the healthcare system, that's really the best way to address the pricing question because the system needs and healthcare needs are still are unmet, and therefore we're trying to focus attention on that, and with that should come the appropriate pricing for our products.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. One follow-up on OTC. It seems that U.S. was minus 4%. I think that's a better rate than we've seen in some time for that business. I was wondering if you can just talk about the products that you've relaunched there. I think you mentioned you've got a modest relaunch of some products. How are those products doing in the market? Are they -- is it too early to say if they're reclaiming their previous share? Or perhaps some additional color there would be helpful.","William C. Weldon","Yes. I think it will be a while until we reclaim the share. What we're doing is getting them out as quickly as we can and what we're getting in the market is selling. I think by the middle of 2012, we'll have most of the products that are going to put back in the market definitely by the end of 2012. So I think you'll see a continual increase in those areas. And as we have product supply going into the market, we'll obviously put promotional dollars behind it to reestablish it. But we're very pleased, we have to say, with the support we've had from the consumer and the support we've had from many areas to be able to bring these products back. And I think people are looking forward to them getting back in the market.","Louise Mehrotra","Larry?","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Dominic, just to clarify, is it your expectation that there's little to no DOXIL sales in 2012?","Dominic J. Caruso","In our guidance, we're assuming we won't have any supply from our supplier until very late 2012.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On the ASR Hip recall, could you give us a sense of the total charges you've taken so far and the expectations going forward? And just lastly for Bill, not to push you out, but is 2012 the year we may hear about your successor?","Dominic J. Caruso","Let me take the first part. So Larry, with respect ASR Hip recall, there's 2 components of it. Just to be clear, there's the ASR Hip recall program. And in the table that we provide a tax to the press release where we give you GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation, you'll see that over the 2 years, those program costs have amounted to about $800 million, so that's disclosed in our table. The other component of the ASR Hip recall is our estimate of product liability. That number we're not providing publicly. And I will say that as we got more information based on most recently revised -- most recent updates to national registries, et cetera, on revision rates, we made our best estimate of what the ultimate revision rates may be based on the information we have available to date. So as we said, as more information would become available, we would update as much as we could and as much as we now know. And we think for what we know today, we've captured all the potential that we're aware of today based on the data that we've seen.","William C. Weldon","Yes. Let me make one comment about DOXIL first. It is our highest priority. We've worked with the FDA, we've had meetings with the FDA. We're looking for any type of quality, high-quality source that we could possibly come up with or other ways to get that product in the market. We do realize how critical it is for individuals, and it is one of our highest priorities. And we're doing every possible. I think, as Dom said, if you look at the current supplier, they're saying not until the end of the year at the earliest. Well, I guess at the end of the year, they're saying. But we're looking for ways to maybe get that product back in the market sooner, if possible. As far as my future, I'm doing my job, I've got a job to do. I really can't comment on that. There'll be a point in time when I'll be ready to leave and the board will feel I'm ready to leave, and I let you all know.","Louise Mehrotra","Sara?","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Bill, you touched on it briefly in your remarks. But can you just talk about emerging markets? It's clearly something, especially with the med tech peers, everyone is talking about making large incremental investments in their emerging markets, both commercial infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities. And I'm just wondering if you can orient us to where you are currently in med tech specifically, what you think your current strengths are and what your investment priorities are near-term.","William C. Weldon","Yes. We've made significant investments. We have an innovation center that we set up for the Consumer group, which is developing specific products for those areas. In Xuzhou, we've set up a facility for innovation for the med tech area to be looking at specific products developed for the emerging markets in those areas and looking at that as kind of an innovation center for that area. The pharm business, we're doing -- we've got a clinical trial for the center set up in Hong Kong. We're working closely with Tianjin University in the oncology area and others where there's opportunities. I think that it's important to -- and I said this in the talk, everybody really gets excited about emerging markets. And I think that we should be excited about them. But I think we can't lose sight of the developed markets also. We have to make sure we're developing products for both areas. But we have very specific centers that have been set up. The other thing that we've done that we think is very important in the med tech area is we've set up training centers to help educate and train surgeons, especially in the area of replacements. If you look at the orthopedic area, big opportunities. We have to make sure we have the right products, and then we have to make sure that the surgeons are capable of doing it. So we have innovation centers that we've set up throughout and then training centers to complement that. So we think we've made the appropriate investments, and we're seeing -- we're very excited about the growth we're seeing throughout all of our businesses. But we have very high expectations.","Louise Mehrotra","Bob?","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bob Hopkins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. First, a quick one for Dominic. Just to be very clear, the difference in the other income line that you talked about in terms of the run rate of $500 million to $600 million, and then 2012 being a year where that's going to be higher because of a pending announcement that you'll make, that gain is included in the $5.05 to $5.15?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, Bob, that is, yes.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then for Bill, just a big-picture question on the Medical Device segment. First, exiting 2011, can you give some overview comments on just how you feel about the trends exiting the year from a utilization perspective, from a procedure volume perspective? And then I noticed that you -- I think I saw on the slide that your operating margins in that division were flat year-over-year despite what you described as a very challenging environment. And I think a lot of the investors that I talked to about the medical device industry broadly are very hesitant about investing in the group because they see margin pressure going forward, given the challenges. So my question is again, one, how you feel about top line utilization trends? But two, how do you feel about the ability to sustain the kind of margins you have in that business, given the challenges that we see out there?","William C. Weldon","Sure. I think when you look at -- the big area is elective surgery. And we're still seeing, though, much lower than it had been previously, but kind of the slope of the line and the decline is to starting to smooth out a little bit. The last time I looked at it, it was about 0.5% drop in elective surgery in that area. So we think we're getting close to the bottom of the trough. The other piece of that, that we think is really important and why it's important that we continue to gain share is that there's going to be the people that need this elective surgery are not having it done because they're unemployed. They've lost insurance or anything else, they're putting it off. But you can only put these procedures off for so long. And there's going to be a bolus of people that will come back in the market over time. Now I don't know it's going to be in 2012 or 2013, but I don't think the market is going to decline as precipitously as it had previously. So I think that the procedures are going to be coming back, and I think we need to invest there. Now there's going to be continued pressure -- well let me, before I -- there's going to be continued pressure on pricing. We saw a significant pressure in this spinal area in the last period of time. I think that the hips we've seen basically continued to decline and in the knees, it's pretty constant right about now. But I think we're going to see pricing pressure continue, but I think we'll start to see the procedures coming back. I think if you also look into the emerging markets, you're going to see significant opportunities for growth in those areas as I said before, a lot of it is due to training and moving into that area. And that's the surgical area and the orthopedic area. But the other areas, there's going to be pressures. But I think as you continue to innovate and bring new products out, we're going to able to see things, for example in the diabetes area, in the ocular lens area. And these types of things are going to see opportunities for growth and continued growth. So we think the investment's there, I think the markets totally grew about 3% last year, give or take if you put them all together, and that's about where we were, even with the challenges we had. So we feel pretty good about where we are and where we're going in that market. And again, the whole area of elective surgery can only continue to decline for so long. And there has to come a point when it hits bottom, and then we're going to start to see a ramp back up over time. And what we want to do is be in a position to take advantage of that.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","[indiscernible]","William C. Weldon","Yes, I think that's going to come to us. If you look at what I said before in the MD&D area, we've really refocused our business to have real clear focus on the appropriate areas. One of the things that we saw is we had all these medical device businesses that were scattered around. What we've done is been able to able to take them into the 3 groups which we said is going to give us focus, going to allow us to be able to penetrate the markets and be able to take advantage of the opportunities in those markets and continue to grow our business and maintain margins, let's put it that way.","Louise Mehrotra","Catherine?","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse. Bill, I know you've been looking forward to entering 2012 and getting past a lot of the headwinds that you had mentioned in your presentation on 2011. But in some ways, I guess, I'm wondering if 2013 isn't the new 2012, in the sense of considering your sort of midpoint of your guidance and the growth implied versus what you achieve this year. Are we looking to next year to kind of see an inflection point where some of the macro factors calm down, the product investments start to pay off more and some of the unexpected fixes that you've had to do go away? Is that the right way of thinking about it? And then I guess I just want to follow up, you guys have given a directional sense of where ZYTIGA sales last quarter were. I think you suggested kind of in the mid-80s. I'm wondering if you can give us any directional sense or an absolute sense for ZYTIGA this quarter and also XARELTO since they are below your threshold, but obviously very strategically important.","William C. Weldon","Yes. What was the first question again?","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2013 as the new 2012 in terms of an inflection point.","William C. Weldon","Yes, I think what we've seen is we kind of -- I would say as I did, we've kind of rounded the corner a little bit in 2011. I think we'll see that 2012 is going to get better. 2013, I think we're going to see continual improvement. We'll going to start getting the McNeil products back and investments in those areas. We're going to see the continued, I think, improvement of the launches of the products going back to 2009 as well as the ZYTIGAs, INCIVOs and XARELTOs this year. So I think that the products are going to keep coming. Hopefully, we'll be looking at Bapis and some of these coming into the market. So as I said in the presentation, we've had to deal with these headwinds. The macroeconomic environment, I'm not going to begin to predict that because I think it's anybody's guess where that goes. You can -- the emerging markets are still growing nicely, but they're growing at a lower rate than they grew last year. Every quarter-to-quarter, they're ratcheting down somewhat. But there'll be nice growth in that area. So yes, I think J&J is on a very good trajectory in the right direction. There's going to be continued investment. As Dom said, we're going to have continued working in the remediation in the OTC area, but that's going to start to see more and more the light of day and these new products. So yes, I think if you look forward, we feel very good about the future, I guess. And 2012 we feel good about, I think we're feeling very good about going beyond that. ZYTIGA?","Louise Mehrotra","So ZYTIGA contributed just a little over 2.5 points of the 6.6 points that we had in the Pharmaceutical group. XARELTO, it's early to be breaking that out. But before you ask, I'll give you INCIVO as well. So INCIVO contributed about 2.5 points to the pharm OUS group.","William C. Weldon","And Catherine, as I said earlier, one point doesn't a trend make. But we felt really good about the most recent results that we've seen in XARELTO. We think we're really seeing some good stuff there.","Louise Mehrotra","David?","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Bill, a question for you. You made a statement in your prepared remarks about what you think healthcare spending will grow over the next 5 years, I believe. And it was around mid-single-digits. And you sort of joined other large global healthcare CEOs in talking about what you think healthcare can grow at. But investors don't seem to be sort of believing that number, whether it's because they think growth rate is going to be lower, but they believe there's going to be significant margin and mix pressure on that level of revenue. So I guess what I'm wondering is I think what investors really want to hear is regardless of what that number is, it's just not it's going to grow 5% or 6%, but there's going to be a change in the way that global healthcare companies begin to distribute healthcare, specifically in the U.S. and maybe it's in light of the Synthes transaction or potential bundling. But if you can help us understand, assuming that number is lower or the margin mix in that 5% growth is lower, how does J&J sort of lead global healthcare companies in changing the way healthcare is distributed in the U.S. to preserve those margins in light of upcoming pressures?","William C. Weldon","Well, I think some of the things I alluded to also in the talk are areas of looking at biomarkers trying to be able to look at ways to deliver personalized medicine, so you're going to have a much higher prediction -- predictor rate as to whether -- individuals will succeed or not succeed with those types of patients. I think we're going have to wait and see what's going to happen in the whole area of evidence-based medicine. There's a whole a lot of things that are going on right now that are putting more pressure, I think, on the industry to make sure that we're giving better clinical results and making sure that we can document the success that we can have in these areas. So I think that there's going to be a change. This is specifically about pharmaceuticals now. I think there will be a change in the way that we'll be looking at products. And I think as we've done and others are doing right now, we're looking at not trying to come out with a 12-proton pump inhibitor and coming out in areas like that. We're looking at drugs that really bring significant changes to patients and offer real advantages. And I think that in some of the markets, when you go into the developed world, I think there's just a whole tremendous opportunity of patients that are coming into the market that historically have not been there. And there's a huge resource -- by that, I'm talking about resources that the government is willing to spend for patients coming into the market. So I think when you look at it, that there's an opportunity. And I don't think all things are created equal. I think you have to make sure you've selected the right target audience and move forward in that area. I mentioned about the orthopedic business, elective surgery before. I think you're going to see that bottoming out. You're going to see patients coming back into the market. We have to realize we have -- the demographics play in favor of healthcare. And patients, as they get older, spend a lot more on their healthcare and their needs. And I think we're going to have to make sure that we have effective products that are going to create value for those patients and work with the governments to make sure that there's the appropriate reimbursement for those.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just a question for Dominic. In terms of the guidance, Dominic, I'm assuming that the guidance you provided assumes a Synthes structure that's roughly equivalent to the structure you announced many months ago. And I guess, maybe just want to get a confirmation on that. But if there is going to be a change in that structure, when do you think we're going to get that announcement? Is it going to be on EU approval? Is it going to be on acquisition close? And are we talking about a change in structure as you think about the opportunities that could move earnings more than 1% to 2%?","Dominic J. Caruso","So just to be clear, the guidance that I provided excludes Synthes, so no impact at all to Synthes, as if the transaction didn't happen. Once the transaction closes consistent with our historical practice, we'll update our guidance to include the impact of Synthes. And at that time, we'll be as transparent as we always are and give you the impacts and changes from ultimate implementation of financing structure versus the previous estimate that we gave you. We'll detail that for you. But we'll do that at time of close.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Still think at this time the prior dilution estimate is the best dilution estimate you have to date?","Dominic J. Caruso","Well, the prior dilution estimate was our most conservative estimate, right, and it was based on no efficiency gained by financing the transaction in any different way than was announced. Obviously, we're going to continue working to see if we can get that to be better, but we won't know and have any details on that until very close to closing as we're working through the entire closing and integration of the transaction.","Louise Mehrotra","Matt?","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Matt Miksic, Piper Jaffrey. A couple of questions for Bill on Medical Devices, specifically. Assuming that we do eventually trough out and some of these volumes start to stabilize and improve, the Synthes acquisition increased what I would call your exposure to sort of the higher acuity end of devices. And I'm wondering, all the pressures on pricing, regulatory reimbursement, have these forces sort of caused you to think, reshuffle your priorities, either strategically, organically, across like the spectrum of chronic, degenerative, more acute devices in terms of your investments? And how so? And I have one follow-up.","William C. Weldon","Well, one of the major areas in Synthes, as we talked about, is the whole area of trauma, which if you want to, you can say it's more of the acute area. And it's an area where it's much less sensitive to a lot of the ebbs and flows. If you need the procedure, you need the procedure. We don't feel that there's any -- we're very excited about the acquisition. We think it continues for all the right reasons to strengthen our orthopedic business, put it into trauma. I think their presence in the emerging markets will also lend itself to some of the advances in our other areas moving into those. So we feel very good about Synthes. Their business has been very strong. So I don't think it's caused us to reassess our position there. And as I said, I think the demographics play so favorably, as well as the emerging markets play so favorably in the orthopedic business that yes we're going through a challenging time, but we think we'll be able to be in a real strong position.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Because I was asking more broadly, have the market forces, pricing reimbursement, tougher regulatory time line, is that beyond Synthes? Is that causing you to rethink chronic, acute, degenerative, focusing in any of those areas more or less?","William C. Weldon","No. I think the one area where it caused us more broadly than that to think about was in the drug-eluting stent area, where we've seen the implants or the stents going down as well as price being challenged quite substantially there, and we felt we'd be in a better position to invest -- take those resources that we'd invest in the stent business and invest elsewhere. But if you look at the endoscopic business, you look at the businesses that we're in, in Ethicon, you look at the power and the ultrasound business, I think we feel that we're still in a very good position, and we're going to continue to invest in those areas because we think the markets will be -- will work out really well for us.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then a follow-up question, if I could, on your forward priorities. You mentioned regenerative medicine as one of the opportunities that you're looking at. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of advanced surgical technologies beyond HARMONIC scalpel into robotics or other areas. Do you see those as opportunities going forward? What kind of role do you think that they play?","William C. Weldon","Robotics specifically -- and during part of my previous life at J&J, we looked at those areas. They made huge strides, they've gotten into lot of areas. But it's an area that we've opted not to go into. So we think that where we're positioned right now is where we ought to be, and hopefully that we'll continue to move in that direction.","Louise Mehrotra","Kristen?","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Dominic -- Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Just want to clarify on Synthes. I think originally you said it was 1% to 2% dilutive. But I think originally you were excluding amortization, and now it sounds like you're going to be including that. Is that correct? And what does that do for dilution --","Dominic J. Caruso","Well, the S4 that we filed discloses the amount of amortization, which on annual basis I think is $500 million or $550 million after tax. And I said in guidance, we're not going to change the way we account for amortization. But when we provide the impact of Synthes, we'll obviously be very clear about how much amortization, incremental amortization is included in that guidance at that time. It also depends on what time of the year we close, et cetera.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But the 1% to 2% originally excluded out amortization costs?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, correct.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just thinking out, I guess, a little bit beyond 2012, just with 2013 with the device tax, can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you expect to manage through that, if you can? Obviously, pricing is a difficult environment, so any restructuring efforts that might overcome the incremental cost?","William C. Weldon","No. I think that the device tax in 2013 is going to come into play. We understand what it is, where we are and we'll continue to manage our business accordingly. So I don't see any difference that we're doing -- any different changes we're going to take.","Louise Mehrotra","So the last question, David?","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David Roman, Goldman Sachs. Bill and Dominic, in your prepared remarks, you talked about accelerating pricing pressure in 2012. As you sort of -- can you maybe provide a little more perspective to what segments you see that maybe from a tiering perspective? And then maybe you can contrast that with where you think the best areas for innovation are. And do those, in fact, line up with the areas of the most pricing pressure? Can you actually offset that with new products? Or is it really going to be about moving the mix of businesses to the areas where there are greater opportunities for innovation?","William C. Weldon","Yes, I think the areas where we see innovation, and I think you have to look at it as how do you get into -- bring really true innovation into the marketplace, like ZYTIGA, I think, brought really true innovation. So I think it's going to be going into areas like Bapineuzumab for Alzheimer's, Canagliflozin for diabetes and bringing true innovation in those areas that are not going to be -- that are going to create -- where there are real needs, we have to continue to be moving into those areas. I think the same thing in the orthopedic area and the whole medical device area, to be able to deliver a drug through a lens, for example, is something that could be very innovative and help in those areas. So I think you're going to have to look at true innovation and move in an area that allows you to bring products that are going to create value for patients and are going to be able to offer value to the system and moving that way. So I think that's really the answer that we have to look at.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then one quick follow-up for Dominic. Anything specific to note in the fourth quarter, is there a pretty sharp sequential set down in margins? And I know margins normally come down throughout the year, but anything specific to note given the relative move compared to history?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, well, in the fourth quarter, just as a reminder, we did the collaboration with Pharmacyclics, which is about $0.04 to $0.05 dilutive just in the quarter. So that was a big jump. And you'll see a big jump in our R&D expense in the fourth quarter. That relates to the licensing payment, the upfront payment that we've made to Pharmacyclics in the quarter. Then we took the opportunity to invest behind the brands and we had some items that we want to clean up and get behind us as we move into 2012.","Louise Mehrotra","Final remarks from Bill?","William C. Weldon","Yes, I just want to say thanks. I think you can tell we're very excited about 2012 and beyond. And I think we're going to see a lot of good things happening. And we do look forward to seeing you all, I guess, at the Medical Device & Diagnostics Business Review in November. So thanks very much."],"12541":["Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Q1 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call April 17, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Joseph Wolk - Vice President, Investor Relations","Joaquin Duato - EVP and Worldwide Company Group Chairman of Pharmaceuticals","Dominic Caruso - EVP and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company","Geoff Meacham - Barclays","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Operator","Good morning. Welcome to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Joseph Wolk","Hello. This is Joe Walk, Vice President of Investor relations and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the investor conference call reviewing Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the first quarter of 2018.","Accompanying me on today\u2019s call are Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will provide commentary on the quarter\u2019s financial performance and Joaquin Duato, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Company Group Chairman of Pharmaceuticals who will participate in the Q&A portion.","Thank you for joining us and your interest in Johnson & Johnson. Our strong first quarter results are an extension of the momentum we established in the second half of 2017. Pharmaceuticals again grew well above the market. Consumers growth maintained its acceleration and medical device has platforms that are enhancing market leading positions as well as areas where we are executing plans to improve performance that are not meeting our objectives as mentioned during our call in January.","We continue to exceed financial expectations while managing the business for the long term to benefit patients, customers and shareholders.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and accompanying schedules.","Please note that this mornings\u2019 presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding commentary included in today's discussion as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.","Our SEC filings, including our 2017 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are all available at investor.jnj.com.","A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.","We anticipate today\u2019s webcast to last approximately 60 minutes. Now, on to our results.","Worldwide sales were $20 billion for the first quarter of 2018, a 12.6% increase versus the first quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 8.4%, as currency had a positive impact of 4.2%.","In the U.S., sales were up 6.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 10.9%, with the effect of currency exchange rates benefitting our reported OUS results by 9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 4.3% worldwide, increasing 1.3% in the U.S. and 7.6% outside the U.S. I will provide the same reference for each segment.","With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.60 versus $1.61 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.06 representing increases of 11.8% and 12.6% respectively compared to the same period in 2017.","On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.5%. Dominic will provide further earnings details in his remarks. Beginning with consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment, highlighting items that build upon the slides that will be presented unless otherwise stated, percentages reference represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2017 or in other words results that exclude the impact of currency translation.","Worldwide consumer segment sales totaled $3.4 billion growing operationally 1.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, mainly the divestiture of the COMPEED business in wound care other franchise outside the U.S. total adjusted operational sales growth was 2% worldwide.","The Beauty franchise led segment performance growing 7.1% operationally. Growth in the quarter was aided by a seasonal inventory build of approximately $20 million related to sun protection products. In the U.S. we are seeing robust growth in the e-commerce channel for the NEUTROGENA and AVEENO brands.","Results outside the U.S. were driven by the Asia Pacific region where Dr. Ci Labo and NEUTROGENA brands had strong uptake. Worldwide and U.S. market shares remained relatively flat compared to the same period of 2017 and the worldwide beauty market is estimated to have grown approximately 4%.","OTC grew 0.9% but that understates the true performance of the franchise. In the U.S. strong consumption in both adult and children\u2019s TYLENOL and children\u2019s MOTRIN was offset by a negative comparison to the first quarter of 2017 when pipeline was built for the launch of the rapid release and chewable children\u2019s TYLENOL negatively impacting worldwide OTC operational growth in the first quarter of 2018 by an estimated three points.","Oral care results reflect a market leading but relatively flat share in a market growing modestly at 1%. The divestitures of the REACH and REMBRANDT brands negatively impacted worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points.","As previously referenced, Baby Care results are not what we want them to be and we have the franchise restage planned for later this year. Our business review day on May 16 highlighting both the consumer and medical device businesses will share more details about Johnson\u2019s baby restage.","Moving on to our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $9.8 billion grew 15.1%, excluding the net impact of the Actelion acquisition, operational, adjusted sales growth was 7.5% worldwide. The segment was led by the oncology portfolio which grew globally 37%.","DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing globally better than 60%. In the U.S. market growth and the strong launch uptake of the one prior line indication is resulting in share gains.","Outside the U.S. DARZALEX is experiencing increased penetration in the 29 EMEA countries it is now commercially available in and growth in the Asia-Pacific region was driven by the products recent approval in Japan last November.","IMBRUVICA in the U.S. gained approximately three points of market share versus prior year across all lines of therapy, based on the fourth-quarter data largely driven by share in line 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia or CLL. The CLL market is estimated to have grown almost 15%.","ZYTIGA had another strong quarter growing 54%. In February, the FDA approved ZYTIGA for patients with metastatic high risk castration sensitive prostate cancer based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. This was a driver for ZYTIGA\u2019s first quarter performance resulting in market and share expansion.","During the quarter, we expanded our presence in the treatment of prostate cancer with the U.S. approval of ERLEADA, a Next-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor to treat pre-metastatic patients. We also filed for EU approval in February.","In immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 12%. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn\u2019s disease as more than 20,000 Crohn\u2019s patients have been treated with the STELARA since that indication launched late in 2016.","Market share has improved 11 points in Crohn\u2019s disease compared to the first quarter of 2017. REMICADE in the U.S. was down 22%, negatively impacted by a prior period pricing adjustment related to a major payers delayed submission of rebate claims. We don\u2019t anticipate significant adjustments will be required in future quarters.","Excluding this adjustment, REMICADE\u2019s decline would have been close to the 16%, largely driven by price erosion as REMICADE has retained better than 95% of its volume share. Lastly, in immunology sales for our newly launched treatment for psoriasis, TREMFYA totaled $72 million.","New-to-brand share including first dose sampling program volume is outpacing the leading competitors. In neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate, long-acting, injectable portfolio grew steadily in all regions with increasing market share, particularly in Europe.","CONCERTA in the U.S. is experiencing negative price due to generic competition. Results for the Actelion pulmonary hypertension assets acquired in mid-2017 are [Indiscernible] to hear on a pro forma basis.","OPSUMIT grew globally 7% which was comprised of 4% in the U.S. and 11% outside the U.S. UPTRAVI continues to experience strong demand with 37% growth in the U.S. As expected, TRACLEER is declining as generics entered the European market during the second half of last year.","The dynamic we noted in the fourth quarter results impacting all three brands was an increased level of patients on assistance programs in the U.S. although that was less of a negative factor as the quarter progressed.","I\u2019ll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical device sales were $6.8 billion growing 3.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.1% worldwide.","Beginning this quarter within the medical device segment, we are reporting revenue for the neurovascular platform in combination with the cardiovascular platform under the label of interventional solutions. This change better reflects our business structure given the recent divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery and the creation of the CERENOVUS neurovascular business unit which includes the Codman neurovascular business as well as the recent acquisitions of Neuravi and Pulsar Vascular.","Both the Codman Neurosurgery and CERENOVUS revenues were previously reported within the orthopedics platform under the spine and other category. Please reference the supplemental sale schedule on our website for additional details.","Within Interventional solutions, Electrophysiology grew approximately 15% worldwide as the Atrial fibrillation procedure market continues to grow and we improve upon our market leadership in the space with newer product offerings in ablation and advance catheters.","In Orthopedics, although selling days did negatively impact growth by approximately one point, we are disappointed with the performance and are actively implementing plans to address challenges we face in this segment.","In trauma, we are experiencing good volume for some of our newer products like the TFNA femoral nail and in hips, we continue to see strong demand for the primary stem ACTIS anterior approach. However, we are losing share in spine as newer competitive entries are being better received in the market as well as in these where we believe new offerings throughout 2018 such as the ATTUNE revision system, ATTUNE S+ and Cementless are expected to improve performance.","We were pleased to announce during the first quarter the acquisition of Orthotaxy, which we believe will provide next-generation robotic assisted orthopedic surgery which will be on display at our May 16 analyst day.","Pricing pressure impacted all categories in orthopedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative 4% in spine, negative 3% in hips, and negative 2% in both trauma and knees. Within the surgery group, the advanced surgery category was strong, particularly outside the U.S. On a worldwide basis, endocutters grew 7% as new products are experiencing strong demand and bio surgery grew 5% driven by Topical Absorbable Hemostat & Bioseal.","Growth & Energy was just shy of 3% as strength outside the U.S. was partially offset by the U.S. market dynamics of a shift to advanced bipolar products and reprocessed products. As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we saw a slight increase in hospital admissions of about 1.5%.","Surgical procedures were down approximately 50 basis points and lab procedures were up about 3%. Our preliminary estimates for the first quarter indicate modest declines across all those rates with admissions growth at 1%, surgical procedures down approximately 1%, and lab procedures up an estimated 2%.","To conclude, the medical device segment vision care. As a reminder, the acquisition of the vision surgical business closed February 27, 2017. Excluding the one month of sales in 2017 for that acquisition and other smaller acquisitions, the vision care business grew approximately 9%. The contact lens business grew a very healthy 11% worldwide on the strength of ACUVUE OASYS and ACUVUE moist lines, but also benefit in the quarter from one of our larger customers scaling up a new distribution center. This was worth about three points.","In Vision Surgical, worldwide growth of 5% on a pro forma basis was driven by intraocular lenses in cataracts. That concludes the sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2018 first-quarter. For your reference, here is the slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the first quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso, who will provide his insights on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s quarterly results for the 46th consecutive time. As most of you on the call know, on March 20, Dominic announced plans for his retirement later this year. While Dominic will still be at investor events in the coming months and opportunities for more proper send-offs will occur, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge on this call his many contributions to Johnson & Johnson and its employees, the healthcare industry and quite frankly industry in its broadest sense.","I have personally learned a great deal from Dominic and benefited from his leadership, a sentiment that I know many folk share. Dominic on behalf of everyone that has had the privilege to know and work with you at Johnson & Johnson, thank you for your years of effort and dedication and the wisdom you were gracious enough to share.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks, Joe and good morning everyone. Well we carried last year\u2019s momentum into 2018 and were off to a strong start this year. We are very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter, with underlying operational sales growth consistent with quarter four of 2017. Both our sales and earnings were above analyst estimates and we continue to make very good progress on our near-term product priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers which we discussed during our call with you in January, and we remain confident in the strength of our business.","In our pharmaceutical business, our strong performance from 2017 continued into the first quarter with underlying operational growth at 7.5%. First-quarter underlying operational sales growth for consumer increased 2%, which is an acceleration over the fourth quarter of 2017.","As with pharmaceutical and consumer, in medical devices, we are also above consensus. We continue to have areas of strength behind new products and our vision business continued growth within electrophysiology as well as our advanced surgery business particularly with the endocutters and bio surgery platforms and in our trauma business. We remain focused on making improvements across our medical device businesses and we will discuss this in greater detail on May 16 at our consumer and medical device business review day.","Additionally, as part of our ongoing portfolio management, we announced a binding offer for Platinum Equity, a private investment firm to acquire our LifeScan business for approximately $2.1 billion subject to customary closing adjustments.","As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, we announced that we plan to implement a series of actions across our global supply chain that are intended to focus our resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply our product portfolio. This will enable us to better meet patient and customer needs, make us more agile in a rapidly evolving healthcare landscape and drive business growth.","We expect our supply chain actions will include expanding our use of strategic collaborations and bolstering our initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize our network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized.","In total, we expect these actions to generate approximately $600 million to $800 million in annual pretax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. Further, we expect to record pretax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 million to $2.3 billion over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity which we will treat us special items.","And as we discussed in January, the new U.S. tax legislation creates greater flexibility and opportunity to capitalize on our investments in innovation and R&D. Infact, we intend to invest more than $30 billion in the U.S. with capital investments in R&D between 2018 and 2021 representing an increase over the prior four years of more than 15%.","Since Joe walked you through the sale results for each segment, I would like to add some overall commentary on those results, our operating performance and what we expect for the balance of the year.","I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2018. As we have mentioned our operational sales growth this quarter was 8.4% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, growth was 4.3%.","If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our adjusted earnings to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2018 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of $1.3 billion on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following; intangible asset amortization expense of approximately $1 billion, a charge for the continuing restructuring of our hospital medical device businesses of approximately 100 million, Actelion acquisition related cost of approximately $100 million and a refinement of tax legislation and other cost of approximately $100 million.","Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $2.06 exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.93 up 5.5% over the prior year.","Now let\u2019s take a moment to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold excluding the impact of intangible amortization and acquisition related cost actually decreased by 140 basis points, primarily due to favorable product mix.","Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.3% of sales were 50 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to lower cost relative to sales growth in the pharmaceutical business partially offset by investments in recent acquisitions and new product launches in the medical device business.","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12% which was a 16% increase versus the prior year as we continue to advance our promising product pipelines. Interest expense net of interest income was higher than last year due to higher average debt levels and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents.","Other income and expense was a net expense of $60 million in the quarter, compared to a net gain of $219 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items recorded in this line, current year was a net gain of approximately $77 million compared to a net gain of $320 million in the same period last year. The prior year had higher level of gains from our investment portfolio.","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.8% compared to 17.5% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. The 17.8 rate for the first quarter is a result of current interpretation of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to foreign tax credits and expense allocations. We expect the treasury to issue updated guidance later this year. This expected update is reflected in our guidance which I will provide later.","Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2018, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise was relatively flat versus the first quarter of 2017, driven by higher levels of operating profit offset by lower levels of other income and expense.","Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, medical devices at 29.3% is lower than the previous year primarily due to investments in recent acquisitions and new product launches. Pharmaceutical margins improved from the prior year by 150 basis points to 46.5% primarily driven by favorable product mix and cost of products sold, and slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales.","Consumer margins declined by 220 basis points to 18% due to an increase in brand marketing expenses supporting the launch of new products. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2018.","At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net debt which consist of approximately $15 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $600 million and $700 million. This is slightly lower than previous guidance due to changes in average debt levels and changes in rates.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation or investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2018 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance due to the anticipated timing of the activities recorded in this account.","This lower level of earnings contribution from these activities will be fully offset by the stronger performance in our business as reflected in our first quarter results. Infact, we now expect pretax operating margin improvement of approximately 150 basis points as compared to 100 basis points in our previous guidance.","And now for a word on taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2018 excluding special items is approximate 16.5% to 18% and that\u2019s no change from our prior guidance. Now turning to sales and earnings; our sales guidance for 2018 includes the impact of generics for PROCRIT and TRACLEER as well as REMICADE biosimilars.","However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PREZISTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we\u2019ve done for several years our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations.","This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2018 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","So for the full year of 2018, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of 4% to 5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $79.5 billion to $80.3 billion. This is higher than our January guidance based on strong Q1 performance.","We now expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures will be between 3% and 4% for the year which is also higher than our previous estimate.","And although we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro as an example which last week was at a $1.23, the positive impact of foreign currency translation would still be approximately 2%.","Thus under this scenario we expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 6% to 7% or total expected level reported sales of approximately $81 billion to $81.8 billion which is higher than our previous guidance.","And now, turning to earnings; considering all the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.80 to $8 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 6.8% to 9.6% which is consistent with our previous guidance.","And again we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements, but just to give you an idea of the potential impact on the EPS with the euro at a $1.23, a reported EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share.","Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from between $8 and $8.20 per share reflecting growth of approximately 11% at the midpoint of that range and this is consistent with our previous guidance. While it still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.","So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I\u2019d like to make a few key points. We expect our operational sales growth to range between 4% and 5% and our underlying growth excluding the impact of acquisitions [ph] and divestitures to be approximately 3% to 4% which is an acceleration from 2017.","With regard to expected EPS growth on an operational adjusted basis, our guidance is strong in the range of 6.8% to 9.6% consistent with our objective of growing earnings faster than sales on a constant currency basis. While we expect the lower level of other income as I noted earlier, we now expect to improve our pretax operating margins by approximately 150 basis points.","Now, before I turn things back to Joe to open up the Q&A portion of the call, I\u2019d like to make a few brief comments regarding my retirement and the great news that Joe will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Johnson & Johnson on July 1.","Joe has been with Johnson & Johnson for the past 19 years and has served on my finance leadership team, reporting to me and we worked together for many, many years. Joe is a strong, collaborative credo-based leader who has a long track record of success most recently in his current role, and as you know him the Head of our Investor Relations Group. I'm confident that Johnson & Johnson will be in great hands and we can expect significant contributions under Joe's financial leadership.","Now regarding my retirement, let me start by saying that having been a CFO for almost 12 years and part of Johnson & Johnson for a total of 19 years I have tremendous pride, respect and appreciation for my Johnson & Johnson colleagues, the healthcare industry, our patients and consumers, partners, financial community, media and all the entities that I've had the privilege to work with during my tenure.","I\u2019m also very appreciative of the phenomenal experiences that I've been afforded and the positive impact both internal and external that this role and its responsibilities has enabled me to make.","Some of the J&J successes that I'm very proud to have been associated with in partnership with my finance team and J&J colleagues include a consistent capital allocation strategy, where after investing in our business at competitive levels, we allocate capital first by paying dividends to our shareholders, then deploying capital for value creating acquisitions and finally using any excess cash to further return capital to shareholders such as through share repurchases.","We've exceeded our competitor composite as well as most major indices for total shareholder returns over the last three, five, 10 and 20-year periods. And we returned two times more value to shareholders than compared our closest competitor over the last five years.","And we\u2019re only one of seven mega cap companies to increase its market cap by more than $175 billion over the last 5.5 years. Finally, I'm proud to be associated with an incredible legacy of exceptional financial performance as reflected in our 34 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases and our incredible 55 negative years of increasing our dividend to shareholders.","And I know that the key to our success as an enterprise and therefore to my success has always been our credo, our purpose and our people as we've all united around the singular focus of changing the trajectory of health for humanity, a bold but inspiring purpose.","I've been inspired every day since I began my career journey at Johnson & Johnson back in 1999 when I joined this great company as a result of the Centocor [ph] acquisition. I quickly realized that I joined a fantastic organization of incredibly dedicated, remarkably intelligent and really passionate people.","As Alex Gorsky often says, our work in healthcare is not a job, it's a calling. Alex Gorsky, our CEO is truly inspirational committed and passionate leader. He has set a high standard for excellence in execution, but I want to sincerely thank Alex for his unwavering support through the years and for being my manager, colleague, partner and my very good friend.","I also want to acknowledge the incredible management committee that I've had the pleasure to work with for many years. They are group of passionate and inspiring leaders. I\u2019m also very pleased to have one very important member here with us today, Joaquin Duato, and I\u2019d like to recognize and thank Joaquin for his bold and visionary leadership which has been integral in our pharmaceutical business delivering outstanding and sustained performance and growth.","My time here at Johnson & Johnson has been without a doubt a humbling and amazing experience for almost two decades and I've had the honor of working alongside people, doing important and outstanding things that positively impact this world. I've enjoyed every minute of my stewardship of Johnson & Johnson's business as CFO and working with all of you. Thank you for your engagement, exchanges and partnership.","And although Joe assumes his new role in July, I\u2019ll still be around for another couple months so we can work to closely ensure seamless transition. And you\u2019ll hear it from me again along with Alex at our May 16th Medical Device and Consumer Business review day. And I'm looking forward to seeing and talking personally with you then.","Let me now turn things back over to Joe to open up the Q&A portion of the call. Joe?","Joseph Wolk","Great. Thank you, Dominic. That takes us to the Q&A portion of today's discussion. As a reminder Joaquin is available with Dominic to address your questions. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Joseph Wolk","Good morning, Mike.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning. Thank you. And Dominic a personal note just to thank you for our relationship over the years, your stewardship of J&J. And I think you set a high bar for everyone in the industry. So, thank you for that.","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Let me, Dominic, let me ask you a couple of items. So, if we go back to the fourth quarter, everybody kind of walked away a bit concerned about topline deceleration in the pharmaceutical business. This quarter you posted a better than expected performance. Can you just give us your thoughts on the outlook for the pharmaceutical business this year today, at April versus where you were in January? And it certainly looks like some of that upside is being driven by ZYTIGA which people are obviously still thinking about the life of that product. So can you give us any updated on your latest thoughts on ZYTIGA and generic competition timing? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Mike. Well, we did have growth in the first quarter for pharma, reasonably consistent with fourth quarter growth of nearly 7.5%. And we did see a couple of factors that we were tracking. One was the continued erosion of REMICADE which in the first quarter was little higher than we expected. But that has to do with an adjustment as Joe mentioned with the one of our payers being delayed in requesting a true-up of the rebates. So we don\u2019t expect that that particular phenomenon is going to continue throughout the balance of the year, so the normalized erosion 16% is then therefore pretty consistent with what we expected.","ZYTIGA did very well in the quarter. It started to do well, last year as a result of the LATITUDE data. It continued. I think that's a product that's continuing to improve patient's lives. Physicians are impressed with the data. And I'm happy to report obviously that we just launched ERLEADA as a follow-up. As I said, we don't expect that we\u2019ll see generic competition for ZYTIGA this year. So, we have it in our plans to continue to grow. Much of our guidance increase is related for the stronger performance of pharma. So as you know we don't give very specific guidance by sector. But I can tell you that the pharma business is driving most of our upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year.","Mike Weinstein","And as Joe -- yes\u2026","Joseph Wolk","Go ahead, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","No, sorry. Either Joe or Dominic, you commented about the orthopedic business, your disappointment this quarter. How much of that do you think was J&J? And do have a view on whether this -- the market was in the U.S. was particularly weak this quarter, just looking at your knee and hip results?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, Mike. It\u2019s a great question. I think if you look at knees and hips. Hips, we feel is still very well received in the marketplace. The ACTIS stem from everything we hear is qualitatively very strong. We do think that there was a selling day impact of roughly a point in orthopedics impacting the U.S. And there's also like qualitative or anecdotal suggestions that a rough flu season also impacted surgeries this quarter. With knees, we think we\u2019ll improve performance as we go throughout the year. As we come up with the ATTUNE Revision entering that the marketplace ATTUNE S+ as well as cementless offerings. So, I would say, it\u2019s a mixed bag that the market was a little bit softer due to some ancillary factors, but there\u2019s also some product performance that we can do as the year progresses.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Can you all hear me?","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Hi, Jami.","Jami Rubin","Okay. Yes, you can. Hi. Dominic, I too want to extend my congratulations and this is been an absolute pleasure to work with you. I think you are incredible class act. You and I have had some fun discussions over the years. You\u2019ve always been extremely respectful and I will always be grateful to that. So congratulations on your retirement and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to go ahead and do -- continue to do great things, and Joe, congratulations to you too. It\u2019s going to be fun to work with you.","Anyway, on to the questions, wondering Dominic if you can provide a little bit more color around the comments related to supply chain action in an effort to reduce complexity and improve cost savings. Can you give more specific color around that? And you talk about 30 billion in additional investments over the next five years or so. Will the cost cutting initiatives the 600 to 800 annual savings offset the additional increases in investment? Will that fund the additional increases of investment? If you can just provide a little bit more color around that?","And then, Joaquin, a question for you on Actelion, obviously something we\u2019ve been following closely. The trends certainly OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI do appear to be a little bit below our expectations and I know that you were really excited about this opportunity, growing and expanding the market. Just in light of the recent acquisition can you sort of give us a state of play, where you are with these assets? When should we start to see a bigger acceleration? Just wondering how you\u2019re performing relative to your own internal expectation? Thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","So let me take the supply chain question, Jami. So just to give you a little bit of perspective on it, so we have \u2013 as you know we have a wide ranging and complex supply chain due to various businesses and technologies that are required to produce our products. And looking forward into the future we need more of some newer technologies like biologics, like an investment in CAR-T for example. And we need less of the technologies that are related to some of the older parts of the portfolio.","So we need to advance our manufacturing footprint to have more capacity with new technologies, less capacity with older technologies. We\u2019re going to do that from a position of strength, so that we\u2019re ready when our plans materialize and our strategies to continue to launch new products that have these new technologies embedded in them and we want to be ready for that.","In terms of the cost savings we mentioned about $600 million to $800 million. That will be gradual over a period of time. We won\u2019t get to that level of $600 million to $800 million until we\u2019re near the end of the program which is about 2022. So -- and some of those cost savings will in fact help us offset things like pricing pressure or help us offset other investments in the company. In the aggregate, the $30 billion in additional both capital investment and R&D over the next four year period, I think is a good number for us regardless of these cost savings. We\u2019re committed to make these investments in the US for some of the technology that we just talked about and particularly additional R&D investment right here in the U.S. So, I think there are good numbers to plan for the future. Joaquin?","Joaquin Duato","Yes. Thank you, Jami for the question. Let me start by saying a couple of headlines on the quarter of the pharmaceutical group. It was another strong quarter with above market growth, 15.1% growth and 7.5 when you exclude Actelion acquisition. And one of the important factors of this growth is that it was global both in the U.S. and international. And it was broadly based with eight of our key products growing double-digit. Importantly, also we made significant progress in our recently launched products and also in our pipeline TREMFYA with 72 million of sales in the quarter and 17% new-to-brand share in psoriasis in December is outpacing the anti-AL-17 class competitors, ERLEADA was also approved in February and we are seeing good uptick of ERLEADA with 80% of prescription coming from urologists.","And I\u2019m also looking forward to the anticipated filing of esketamine in the second half of 2018. And you\u2019re going to see more data on this promising medicine in a few weeks at the APA Meeting. Finally let me get into your question about Actelion. And the answer is, Actelion is delivering as expected. We knew about the TRACLEER generics outside of the U.S. and we also expect to have TRACLEER generics in the U.S. later this year. However both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI are posting a strong demand growth and we anticipate that this performance is going to improve for both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI during the year moving forward.","So, let me give some details on OPSUMIT, OPSUMIT has new-to-brand share on the ERA category in the U.S. of 48% and in Europe of 60% demonstrating that even in the face of TRACLEER generics OPSUMIT is the preferred agent. We have 91% PREZCOBIX and 97% in commercial, showing that we have broad access in the U.S. So we are pleased about the progression of OPSUMIT and we anticipate that that we are going to continue to progress moving forward. And when it comes to UPTRAVI the new-to-brand share in the prostacyclin category is also 66% and we continue to make progress with it. And working in educating physicians about data of the study \u2013 the GRIPHON study indicating that earlier use of prostacyclin could have benefit. So we see positively the results so far and we anticipate that they are going to improve as the year progresses.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Jami. Next question, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi. Good morning. And Dominic, you will missed and best of luck in retirement and spending more time with your grand kids and hope to be able to say good bye to you in person next month, So best of luck.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks very much.","Glenn Novarro","And I just had two questions for Joaquin on the pharma side. The first has to do with pharmaceutical pricing. Some of the drugs, XARELTO, ZYTIGA and REMICADE, they differed from our expectations based on our analysis of IMS data, which suggests there's pricing going on. So I\u2019m wondering if you can help us with REMICADE pricing with ZYTIGA pricing which again ZYTIGA came in much better, so I\u2019m assuming some of that was pricing.","And then, XARELTO which came in later, so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s more discounting in the market. So, if you can touch on those three drugs. And then just more specifically about pricing for the rest of the year, particularly in light of the next week President Trump I think is going to talk more broadly about his views on pharmaceutical pricing in the U.S. And then I just had a quick follow-up on STELARA and TREMFYA. Thanks.","Joaquin Duato","Thank you for the questions, Glenn. Let me start with the general one on pharmaceutical pricing overall. As you mentioned, we expect that there\u2019s going to be an announcement on pricing by President Trump and that announcement will resemble the drug pricing policies including in the President\u2019s budget and the Council of Economic Advisers' report. Those policies were generally seeking to increase competition and to reduce out of pocket cost for patients while recognizing the value of innovation.","We also understand that the announcement will include the request for information from the public on drug pricing issues and we are looking forward to participate there. Going into our pricing in the U.S and to your question on how do we see pricing trends for us in the U.S? We see that if you exclude REMICADE and the one-time adjustment that was referred by Joe earlier, we see a continuation of the trends that we have seen in the previous quarter. So we don\u2019t see a big change from what you saw in previous quarters.","Specifically in your question of ZYTIGA, the increase of ZYTIGA is generally demand and share-driven. With the approval of LATITUDE we have seen a very significant growth of ZYTIGA in the U.S. and ex-U.S. with 53% growth year-over-year, 75% in the U.S. and 37% ex-U.S. AS a reminded, 55% of the sales of ZYTIGA are realized outside of the U.S. So the demand of ZYTIGA is very much shared and market-driven. When it comes to XARELTO, there is two factors that have influence XARELTO this quarter.","The first thing I have to say is that, it grew 13% and it also gain share when you look year-over-year, so we gain 1.6 points of share in the anticoagulant market. When we look at the comparison with the previous quarter there are two factors that influence in. The first one is that we had an inventory build at the end of the third quarter due to Hurricane, Maria supply issues that we have burned in the first quarter.","And the second one is that it happens every beginning of the year, every first quarter of the year, the new access agreement seeking and that also impacted our first quarter sequential comparison. So in general as I said we exclude the REMICADE situation. We see the pricing environment overall been similar to the trends we experienced in the previous quarters.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the question, Glenn.","Glenn Novarro","Thank you.","Joseph Wolk","Next question, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Joseph Wolk","Why don\u2019t we move on to the next question, Rob, then we can put Geoff back in.","Operator","Yes. Your next question is coming from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.","Josh Jennings","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And I\u2019ll be brief. Dominic, you will missed and it sad to see you go and congratulations Joe on the new seat. I was hoping just to start off with a question on guidance for Dominic. Just on the pretax operating margin guidance increased with I think 150 basis points from approximately 100, I believe, on the fourth quarter call. The 1Q pretax operating margin performance was flattish. Was there some one-time issue in 1Q? Or can you just help us outside of the bump in the top line you also have a reduction in other income? So what are some of the drivers that are leading to that increased outlook, improved outlook for the operating margin performance for the rest of the year?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, we saw very good cost of goods sold performance in the first quarter. It was down 140 basis points, has to do with the mix of the products sold, but also the great work that\u2019s done in our supply chain to be more efficient in manufacturing. We also have as you saw relatively a slower increase in the rate of selling marketing and expenses in relation to the rate of sales increase. So we\u2019re still investing there. But we\u2019re obviously leveraging the business in terms of productivity that\u2019s particularly pronounced our pharmaceutical business.","And then the other income and expense line, we have a lower expectation. Now simply due to the timing there\u2019s a number of activities that we undertake. Each year we look to \u2013 obviously look to further enhance our portfolio by exiting some lower growth categories or brands or products and entering new ones.","And they are always difficult to predict, Josh, and we just think that some of them will move over into 2019. We\u2019re still on track with many of them, but we\u2019ll probably see some more in 2019 than in 2018. And so, we decided it will be prudent to just lower that expectation. Again, completely offset by the stronger performance in the business and improved pretax operating margin as I just mentioned.","Josh Jennings","Great. And I was hoping to just follow-up with a high level question on the medical device business. I understand we\u2019re going to get a lot of details next month. But just in terms of thinking about the executive team\u2019s patience with that business unit, I mean it seems as if recent strategy has been to proven lower growth, lower margin business units with some tuck-ins. Is that how we should think about the strategy going forward? Is continue with internal R&D and continued pruning? Thanks a lot for taking the questions.","Dominic Caruso","Well, Josh, just to put it in perspective, I mean, there are areas within the medical device business that are really very strong, right. So our vision business is doing exceptionally well. Electrophysiology doing exceptionally well, endocutters doing well, our trauma business is back on track. And so having said that we do have areas where we need to improve and we\u2019ll improve in those areas through a number of factors. As we've always done at Johnson & Johnson over the years. A good mix of internal innovation and acquisitions and new technologies, I don't think that's ever been an issue for us. We\u2019ve always been able to do that.","And you will obviously talk more about it on May 16 when you\u2019ll get to hear from the leaders of the business who are responsible for their business both on what's happened in the market and with our products and the enthusiasm they have for the launch of new products and new areas that they\u2019re getting into, so I look forward to joining you for that and we\u2019ll hear a lot more about that than.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Josh. Next question, Rob.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Hi, guys. Can you hear me?","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Hi, Geoff.","Geoff Meacham","Perfect. Good morning, Jon. Thanks for the question and let me also offer congrats to both Dominic and to Joe.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks Geoff.","Geoff Meacham","Just had a few on the pharma segment, so Joaquin, when you look at the DARZALEX trajectory, the growth has obviously been quite good, but how do you think about where adoption trends could go into first-line myeloma? And then in this market how disruptive could the BCMA class do you think could be to the myeloma market?","And then a follow-up more broadly for Dominic, now that you have Actelion deal fully integrated. I want to get your perspective on attitudes towards pharma growth going forward? Are you comfortable with the level today? Do you feel like a bolt-on would be helpful to the tick up growth or is the pipeline kind of set for more of an inflection looking out say 12 to 24 months?","Joaquin Duato","Okay. So thanks for the question and thank you asking about DARZALEX. As you\u2019ve seen this actually been a very rapid uptake. With adoption both in the hospital and in the clinic, to-date in the U.S. we have had already 21,000 patients treated DARZALEX. And as you have seen we are posting a strong growth with 64% in the quarter. Largely this is due to our increasing share in line two in which we had in the first quarter, 24% of new-to-brand, so, really are very positive result. What is going to be the next growth driver? As you mentioned it\u2019s going to first-line. We are expecting the approval of our first-line indication in the U.S. in this first couple of the year and that is the study that we are comparing with BMP. And then we also are expecting that data read of our additional first-line studies, the one with REVLIMID and the one in transplant eligible later this year.","So that body of data in first-line is going to be the driver of future growth of XARELTO or excuse me, of DARZALEX. What is interesting to see is that in every single study that we have done with DARZALEX we have add DARZALEX to different combos. DARZALEX has always in every single one including the ALCYONE has always been able to double the PFS and to triple the MRD showing the synergistic effect that DARZALEX had in every treatment regimen. So we are very positive about how DARZALEX is doing. And we believe that as you mention the next wave of growth with DARZALEX is going to come with adoption in first-line subsequent to the approval that we\u2019ll have in this first half of the year.","Dominic Caruso","And Geoff, I think undoubtedly our strategy in pharma has been very successful for a long period of time which includes a good mix of internal and external development and quite frankly they are picking the right products and collaborating with others in some very important areas like in oncology. So good examples are IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX are two really good examples. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. We just announced the collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb on a new anticoagulant, mechanism of action of Factor XIa. ","So that is been the hallmark of our success in pharma and I think that'll continue. The pipeline is very strong. We\u2019re now -- eight more products we intent to file between now and 2021, each having a billion-dollar potential. Having said that, there maybe times when there's an opportunity to do a great deal in pharma like we did with Actelion. And that depends on the right price with the right partner at the right time. And we think that generates value for our shareholders, we\u2019ll do that. But I would say, we have a very, very good, solid pipeline already and our collaboration strategy has proved to be remarkable and I think that'll continue as the primary way of growing the pharma business.","Joaquin Duato","If we look even forward the next \u2013 the other important event with DARZALEX for the first-line approval it\u2019s going to be the subcu formulation. We have now four ongoing Phase III studies with the subcu formulation and we expect the filing before 2021. So that would create another opportunity for DARZALEX to improve patient convenience and to continue to grow adoption.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the question, Joe. Next question, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Wolk","Good morning, David.","David Lewis","Good morning. Dominic, we\u2019re running out of superlatives to subscribe your tenure. So I would say, congratulations and I hope Joe has big feet. So, Dominic, one for you and then one for Joaquin here. So, we think about the first quarter Dominic as relates to basically the guidance, is first quarter kind of a decent proxy for the year as it relates to growth? So basically if pharma gets better this year, consumer gets a little better and devices is more flattish?","Dominic Caruso","Well, I think the way to think about the first quarter there's a few things that will not continue. For example, in the first quarter we had some timing of tenders in Europe. So you see the very strong pharma performance in Europe that has a lot to do with the timing of tenders in Europe and that obviously doesn\u2019t continue with every quarter. We also had this particular adjustment that we talked about that was negative in first quarter, a catch up on rebates from one of the major payers. And we do expect that we\u2019ll see an acceleration of TRACLEER and PROCRIT generic erosion going into the balance of the year.","At the same time, we expect that medical devices will continue to accelerate as well as consumer. So overall we had some puts and takes in the first quarter. We've increased our overall guidance about a half a point from our current -- from the previous expectations and we\u2019ll update you more obviously as we see second quarter results. But overall I think we're in great shape and I'm pretty confident we\u2019re going to deliver on a good solid year of this year as we did last year.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful. And then two follow-ups from me on the pharma. The first is just on REMICADE. You talked about that being kind one-time, but is that sort of 16% adjusted number decline. Is that a good way to think about that the balance of the year? And then for Joaquin on esketamine, obviously, a key product launch back half of this year, hasn't come up much on the call. I know we\u2019ll see data here in the second quarter, can you just talk about the size of that commercial opportunity and how you think your confidence in that commercial ramp, just given the unique dynamics of this market? Thanks so much.","Joaquin Duato","Thank you for the question on REMICADE, I think that the 15%, 16% that you quoted is a good way to think about the erosion moving forward this year. The related with Esketamine we are very excited about Esketamine, it\u2019s been a long time that we don\u2019t have a new mechanics of action in the treatment of \u2013 treatment kind of depression. As you know Esketamine uniquely has two breakthrough designations, one in treatment of depression and the other one in suicidal ideation. And we are looking forward to be able to file in the second half of this year and you are going to see more data in the phase III, one of the phase III studies at the upcoming APA.","So what is the medical meet here? I mean you know how many people uses antidepressants and you know how many people that is using antidepressants is not getting the right response. So you are talking about millions of patients in this case. It\u2019s one of the categories more used in all the pharmaceutical market, so the commercial and patient opportunity is very very significant and I think it\u2019s one that has been underestimated generally.","This is going to be uniquely if we are able to demonstrate that in the phase III studies which are going to be the most important thing to look after. It\u2019s going to be the first time that a new medicine is able to demonstrate efficacy on top of an active medication. So that has been never demonstrated, so it would be the first time that any medicine is able to demonstrate efficacy on top of an active medication. So we believe that it has very significant opportunity.","It also builds on our expertise in CNS; remember that we are the leading company in schizophrenia with our long-acting therapy franchise which by the way posted double digit growth this quarter. We have a strong equity in the psychiatric community and we have a very good understanding of how to manage site of care issues based on our experience in REMICADE and in orders helping physicians to be able to appropriately administer the medicine at the site of care. So we are very confident on Esketamine, we are very confident also in our capability in being able to translate good clinical data, a potential approval into patient access through our ability to manage site of care market access for this product. Thanks for the questions, David. Rob, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners.","Joaquin Duato","Good morning, Danielle.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Danielle.","Danielle Antalffy","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and Dominic, thank you so much for all you\u2019ve done over the years and I\u2019m very grateful for the relationship that we\u2019ve developed. Joe excited for you and to work with you going forward even more. So, I just wanted to ask a question as it relates to the commentary about the incremental $30 billion now with tax reform and how to think about the approach you guys are going to take between incremental investment in organic R&D versus inorganic capital deployment, does that change the strategy at all or potentially make you get more aggressive on the inorganic front?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, well Danielle just to clarify, so $30 billion invested in R&D and capital investments in the U.S. which is a 15% increase over the prior four year period. And in terms of the mix, I think we will continue to look for productivity from our incredible efforts in R&D particularly in the pharma business where we investment at the higher rates in the industry in R&D.","So I think we\u2019ll continue to maintain that, we\u2019ll continue to do as I said earlier to an earlier question collaborate, and bring on both on our products in pharma as well as cross medical devices, but you know look 50% of our growth over long periods of time has come from acquisitions, have come from external enabled growth and I don\u2019t think that will change going forward. It\u2019s just a matter of the right asset at the right price that will create value for shareholders. I don\u2019t see a major shift in our strategy in that regard.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the question, Danielle. Next question, Rob?","Operator","Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Dominic, congratulations on your timing, it truly was a pleasure working with you and Joe, congratulations on your new role.","Joaquin Duato","Thanks, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen","Two quick questions. One financial one Pharma, so Dominic you guided to 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion of other income in 2018. Did this become a headwind to EPS growth next year or do you expect that to remain at an elevated level via additional divestitures, I think in the past Dominic you said that, that line underlying other income excluding one-time items is $500 million to $600 million is that still the case basically, how do you want us to think about that line going forward.","And I\u2019ll just quickly fit in the pharma question, it\u2019s a quick one. Working on the COMPASS trial, do you expect an FDA panel? Is it possible still to get an accelerated review and how are you thinking about that impacting XARELTO growth? Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, well Larry this 1.5 to 1.7 is lower than our previous guidance as you know and that\u2019s because of timing primarily so some of the activities are going to shift into 2019, so that gives us quite a head start on that line if you will for 2019. And we are going to continue to look at optimizing our portfolio. When we do that, we have these gains and we typically use some of those gains to invest back in the business, so you see a higher, much higher level of R&D investment if you compare it to any prior period when the line is lower in prior period.","So it\u2019s not always just driving earnings, in fact it utilized it\u2019s basically a portfolio decision. We\u2019re investing in new products, with the gains that we get from divesting products. I think that will be the case going forward. I think the 500 to 600 that I mentioned earlier is still a good underlying number for that line, and as I mentioned we\u2019re seen improvements in our pretax operating margin and we expect that will continue to grow as the consumer business ramps back up and the medical device business improves and obviously the continued strength of Pharma, so even if that line is a little bit lower going forward we have the higher pretax operating margin which will drive our earnings growth.","As you know Larry, we generally look to grow our sales at a better pace that\u2019s faster than the markets we compete in, but then we also look to grow our earnings at a pace that slightly faster than the rate of growth in sales, I think will continue to do that through the right mix on the P&L.","Joaquin Duato","So thank you for the question on XARELTO [ph]. We are very also excited about COMPASS and the COMPASS result. As you recall, we presented the COMPASS results at the ESC in August last year and the results were impressive with 24% risk reduction in MACE. We filed in December and we are anticipating potential approval in the fourth quarter of this year. Regarding an Advisory Committee, I cannot comment on that, we don\u2019t know. So what is the market opportunity and the relevance and significance of COMPASS.","As we have discussed with you in the past, this is a population of about 10 million potential patients you know that that those would be lower 2.5 milligram in combination with aspirin [ph] and it\u2019s a new treatment paradigm, so we are very excited about being able to bring this new therapeutic option here.","It\u2019s also important from my competitive perspective. We are the only new oral anticoagulant that has this broad development program called Explorer that contains a reduction in MACE for CAD\/PAD patients but also all indications that I will comment and that will enable us to do a couple of important things. First, have a new grow driver for XARELTO in addition of the existing set of indications. Second, differentiate ourselves from the competition and in that case gain share in the particular anticoagulant market.","And third, as we will be the only one to have this indication we have differentiated those, also have a stronger position vis-\u00e0-vis the payers. So we think it\u2019s a very significant opportunity for us. And as I said this is only part of multiple Phase III indications seeking a study that we have in XARELTO. So COMPASS is one, but if I can refresh your memory there, you know that we also have the MARINER, the COMMANDER studies that will read this year, respectively, in medically ill patients and congestive heart failure that also represent a very significant opportunity to upgrade the standard of care of anticoagulation in these patients.","So overall, the EXPLORER program that is going to start with the COMPASS study it\u2019s going to be a growth driver for XARELTO that is going to put us in a much better position moving forward from that competitive perspective.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the questions, Larry. Rob, I think we\u2019ve got time for one more.","Operator","Yes, it is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Joaquin Duato","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Hopkins","Hey good morning and also let me offer my congratulations to both Dominic and Joe because those statistics were obviously very impressive. Yes, since the device day \u2013 device and consumer day is coming up, I thought I\u2019d ask two quick device questions. One, on the ortho sort of pure pricing numbers that you provided in prepared remarks. I was just curious, are those U.S. numbers and they did seem a little worse. Is there something going on with pure price that\u2019s worth calling out, that was the first question?","And I\u2019ll just sort of rattle off the second one. I was curious at the upcoming analyst day you know how much detail you might be willing to provide or are going to provide on the surgical robotics JV. Will we get a lot of specifics in terms of timelines and seeing the device or is it too early to be specific? Thank you very much.","Joaquin Duato","Yes, so Bob with respect to the price, that was U.S. only, and we provided this quarter pure price. In the past we put it in with mix but then we found out that you and your peers would simply ask for it on the follow-up cost, so we thought it was just little bit more clear. In terms of overall pure price trends, we haven\u2019t seen any deviation from what\u2019s consistently been in place for the past few quarters.","And at the upcoming medical device and consumer day, we will have a dedicated portion of the program on surgical robotics. We\u2019ll talk about the current status of the venture that we have with -- through with Verily. We'll give you as much as we can, a description of the current state of the of the robot. We\u2019ll show you some aspects of it of course, we want to be careful as to the competitive issues that that could raise, but I feel you\u2019ll get a good understanding of where we are, how it works, how it\u2019s different and we\u2019ll also talk about Orthotaxy, the new knee robotic technology that we just acquired, Bob. So that will be a dedicated portion of the session to bring everyone up to date.","Joseph Wolk","Great. So thanks Bob for the question and to everyone who asked the question today. And apologies to those who we could not get due to time, but certainly don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as you need to do follow-up.","I will now turn the call back to Dominic for some closing remarks.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks Joe. And I want to sincerely thank all of you here in the room with me and listening on the phone for the tremendous support partnership you\u2019ve given me and Johnson & Johnson each and every quarter. It\u2019s hard to believe this is the 46th quarter that I\u2019ve done this. So it\u2019s been a pleasure.","I also want take one more opportunity to express my confidence and our guidance for this year, the overall success of our business, and I\u2019m very optimistic about the future of Johnson & Johnson. I look forward to seeing you all on May 16 at our consumer and medical device business review day. Thanks for joining us today and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Joining me on the call today, are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web site at investor.jnj.com. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing fourth quarter and full year results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2014 results and provide a strategic outlook for the Company. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business and review the income statement and provide guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson Web site, as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our Web site.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 and the Company\u2019s subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the Company and on our Website.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web site. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies, this slide lists the acknowledgement of those relationships not otherwise referenced in today\u2019s presentations.","Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, down 0.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2013. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9% and currency had a negative impact of 4.5%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 1.2%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 7.9%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew 3.9%, while both the Asia-Pacific and Africa region and Europe grew 0.6%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products in all regions was partially offset by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying operation of 0.7% worldwide, 10.7% in the U.S. and 3.6% outside the U.S.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $2.5 billion and earnings per share were $0.89 versus the $1.23 a year-ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $1.1 billion for after-tax special items. Fourth quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $42 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.27, representing increases of 1.4% and 2.4% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013.","Now turning to the financial highlights for the full year of 2014, consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2014 were $74.3 billion, an increase of 4.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, sales grew 6.1% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 1.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was approximately 8% worldwide, 11.6% in the U.S. and 5.1% outside the U.S.","Turning now to earnings, 2014 annual net earnings were $16.3 billion and earnings per share were $5.70. For the year, 2014 adjusted net earnings were $17.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $5.97, up 7.7% and 8.2% respectively versus the 2013 results. Free cash flow for the year was strong at $14.7 billion, up $900 million versus 2013.","Turning now to business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2013, unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact. I\u2019ll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.9% with U.S. sales up 2.5%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 0.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestiture, underlying operational growth was 2.1% worldwide, 4.9% in the U.S. and 0.7% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, U.S. Skin Care, as well as Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health outside the U.S. This growth was partially offset by lower sales of Baby Care and Skin Care outside the U.S., due to competitive pressures and prior-year inventory stocking.","OTC sales growth was driven by analgesics and upper respiratory products. Upper respiratory grew 8% worldwide driven by sales growth outside the U.S. Analgesic growth was 16% with growth in the U.S. of 24% driven by share gains, as well as trade inventory build related to the re-launch of products. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was 11%, up from approximately 9.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 42%, up from 34% a year ago. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO in U.S. Skin Care, as well as LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health products outside the U.S.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8 billion increased 13.9% with U.S. sales up 22.7% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.8%, driven by strong sales of new products, as well as core growth products. A major driver was our Hepatitis C product, OLYSIO. Excluding sales of Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 11%, 16% and 7% respectively. Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA as well as XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION and recently launched IMBRUVICA.","Net revenue recorded from IMBRUVICA in the fourth quarter was $92 million worldwide, with $64 million in the U.S. On a full year basis, net revenue was $200 million worldwide, with $144 million in the U.S. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, complemented by increased market share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. U.S. export sales of REMICADE were down due to timing of shipments to our distribution partners. XARELTO sales were up 58% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to 15%, up approximately 0.5 point from last quarter and up over 4.5 points from a year-ago. Cardiology TRx estimated at 23.5% was up over 4.5 points from a year-ago.","INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET sales were approximately $200 million in the quarter, with over $190 million in the U.S. contributing approximately 3.5% to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. In U.S. INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET achieved 4.1% TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 3.3% in the third quarter of 2014. TRx in endocrinologist grew to 10% for the quarter, up approximately 1% sequentially. INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET was the category-leader in new-to-brand share with endocrinologists reaching over 19% at the end of the quarter.","Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer market at over 15% drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was approximately 31% of that market down approximately two points on a sequential basis due to increased competition. Continued strong market uptake and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 95 countries. INVEGA, SUSTENNA or XEPLION, achieved strong result in all regions due primarily to increased market share.","I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.6 billion decreased 4.7%. U.S. sales declined 7.7%, while sales outside the U.S declined 2.3%. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestures, underlying operational growth was 1.5% at worldwide, with the U.S down 1% and growth of 3.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by orthopedics and cardiovascular care products, partially offset by lower sales in vision care. Competitive pricing dynamics negatively impacted growth for vision care in the U.S. This was partially offset by growth outside the U.S with strong results in emerging market.","Orthopedics sales growth was driven by Sports Medicine, hips, spine and knees. The successful launch of MONOVISC coupled with the continued strong growth for ORTHOVISC drove results for Sports Medicine. Hip growth of 5% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Spine grew 3% with solid market volume growth and new product launches partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Knees worldwide increased 3% due to the successful launch of ATTUNE, with pricing pressure offset by positive mix. Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 16% worldwide increase in our BioSense Webster business due to strong growth of the ThermoCool SmartTouch Catheter.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter of 2014. For your reference, there were some notable developments in the fourth quarter which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. Lastly, to assist you in updating your models for the full year 2014, on our Web site you will find annual sales highlights by-segment, as well as adjusted earnings before tax by-segment.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Louise and good morning everyone who has joined the call today. I am really pleased to be reviewing with you the highlights of our very strong 2014 results and a preview of '15 and beyond. But before I get to that, I\u2019d like to start as I often do with just a word on Our Credo. This remarkable document was written 71 years ago by the son of our founder and Johnson & Johnson has long been guided by its principles. And what I can tell you is that this philosophy, this ethos is alive and well in our organization. There is a fixated version of it etched in glass and positioned directly in front of my desk. It\u2019s something we pay a lot of attention to and it challenges our entire Company to ensure that we\u2019re working with the interest of our key stakeholders in mind consumers, care-givers and patients, our employees, the global communities in which we live and work and of course our shareholders.","And as we enter 2015, the business of Johnson & Johnson is very strong and we\u2019re well-position for the long-term. We delivered 31 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases, and 52 consecutive years of dividend increases for our shareholders. We\u2019re one of just three companies to be Triple A rated by all three major credit agencies, which continues to afford us many benefits in the financial markets. Our products are industry and segment-leading with 70% of sales coming from the number one or number two market share position and 25% of our sales coming from products we\u2019ve launched in the past five years. And we reward the shareholders by returning about 70% of our free cash flow over the past decade, which amounts to about $90 billion.","As most of you know, Johnson & Johnson is built around three core businesses and as the chart on the left of the slide shows, our Pharmaceutical segment generated over 32 billion in sales last year, followed by Medical Devices at 27.5 billion and 14.5 billion in Consumer to round it out. We\u2019re the largest pharmaceutical company in the United States and the fastest growing Company among the top-10 globally. We\u2019re also the market-leader in Medical Devices which includes surgery, orthopedics and consumer medical devices, like vision care and diabetes. And we\u2019re a market-leading consumer products healthcare company as well.","And so looking back on 2014 here is a slide I presented last January, that delineated our commitments for the year and I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019ve achieved our near-term priorities and exceeded our financial targets of full year operational sales growth of 6.1%. We successfully restored a reliable supply of the over-the-counter medicines the shelf in the United States and saw strong growth in our pediatric analgesics. And at DePuy Synthes which showed 3% operation growth over the prior-year led by the trauma, hips and knee businesses, we\u2019ve begun to realize the benefits of the scale and breadth of the combined businesses which have contributed to strategic wins in key markets. And by any measure we built on the already strong momentum in our Pharmaceuticals business, driven by the strength of key products including OLYSIO, XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVOKANA and IMBRUVICA. Later, I\u2019ll cover the progress we\u2019ve made against our long-term growth drivers, particularly in the area of innovation.","To set context for our businesses going forward, there are a few points I\u2019d like to make about the dynamics shaping the global healthcare environment. First is the rising cost of healthcare, which by 2020 is expected to account for 21% of the GDP in the United States, nearly 11% in the European Union and 6% in China. And as I travel around the world, it's clear that providing sustainable high-quality healthcare is one of our society's greatest challenges. It's at the forefront of many discussions I have with our associates, government leaders, physicians, hospital administrators and executives at our peer companies. As the world's largest healthcare company, we're working to assume a leading role in the solutions which must be centered on the patient and improving outcomes.","Next, expanding access is an important macro trend impacting how we and others think about the future of the business. Healthcare reform efforts and improving economies are clearly helping more people access affordable quality care, which will certainly help in the fight against cancer, obesity and heart disease. And here in the U.S, we\u2019ve seen healthcare utilization rates increase for the second quarter in a row, both sequentially and versus the prior year. And we estimate that we will continue seeing similar to slightly higher growth rates when all of the fourth quarter numbers are reported. Managing those dynamics demand innovation and new models and are driving considerable health industry consolidation at the health system level, as well as in the med tech, pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, where the M&A activity is back to peak levels last observed before 2009.","The good news is the governments are increasingly recognizing the need to continue to address healthcare needs and are taking steps to reward innovation through FDA and EMEA designations that are helping to speed product review times. And in thinking about all of these dynamics in the marketplace, today I will cover three themes about Johnson & Johnson that are driving our confidence in the future. First, the core businesses at Johnson & Johnson are strong and positioned to continue expanding our market-leadership positions. Next, we have an exciting and deep product pipeline across the entire enterprise. And we\u2019re changing the way we interact with our customers and evolving our structure to be more effective and efficient to drive growth.","Now I am also a firm believer that in order to achieve our goals as a Company, it's important to establish a clear set of priorities for the entire organization. Three years ago, when I first assumed this role we were very focused on excellence in execution and given the progress we\u2019ve made today, we're evolving our approach placing an even greater emphasis on innovation and accelerating growth with continued excellence in execution as a non-negotiable part of the process. So without compromise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments.","In Pharmaceuticals, we'll continue building on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In Medical Devices, the emphasis is on growth acceleration from innovation and also by transforming our go-to-market models that better reflect the reality, the purchasing decisions are increasingly being made at the healthcare system level, as they look to improve the quality of care they provide patients, while controlling cost. And in Consumer, we're expanding our market-leadership in key segments within the over-the-counter medicines, oral care, baby and beauty markets.","Let me take you through the thinking of how we will meet these priorities in each one of our businesses. Let's start first with our Pharmaceutical business. I've got to tell you, I could not be proud of this organization. About six years ago we lost $8.5 billion of sales to patent expiry and this was out of about a $24 billion portfolio in our Pharmaceutical business. Now, a lot of companies have chosen different strategies, but what we said is, first of all we want to be very focused on innovation and are developing differentiated products that will ultimately help fulfill unmet medical needs. We focus on five therapeutic areas, recognizing that we can't be everything to everybody. And we've also said that we want to go where the best science is and have a mix of internal and external innovation, while being completely agnostic about the source. And the results really speak for themselves.","The 14 new products launched since 2009, driving cumulative sales of over $27 billion, six of these products have already crossed the $1 billion threshold. With this we are the industry-leader in terms of research and development productivity and that means per dollar spent compared to the benchmark. And the story is not over, in 2014 we had 20 new line extensions approved and we filed an additional 20. We also started 23 Phase 3 trials and initiated 11 Phase 2 trials. And as currently constituted, our pipeline is poised to yield 10 potential new product filings between 2013 and 2017.","Next, our Medical Devices business is in a very strong leadership position particularly in orthopedics, electrophysiology, surgery and vision care, where there is a lot of innovation advancing the standard-of-care. Many of our platforms are overwhelming market-leaders in their categories and 85% of our sales are from platforms with a number one or number two position. We have 10 different platforms in this business that have exceeded $1 billion in sales, which is quite remarkable when you think about it. And we're growing very well in emerging markets and are capitalizing on the scale, depth and breadth of the portfolio we can offer to governments, large healthcare systems and large payors around the world to add value and help patients and we grew sales in China by nearly 15% on an operational basis last year. We've launched over 50 major new products since 2012 and have more than 30 new filings pending as at the end of the year. So again, this is a very strong business that's well-positioned for the future.","In our Consumer brands, these are the ones that most people know us by. As you can see we're guided by inside driven innovation and have taken a very focused approach to meeting key consumer need space led by our 12 megabrands. And while they are nearly U.S the OTC business continues to operate in their consent decree they are on-track with all of their commitments and the consistent supply of these products are returning to the market. I am incredibly proud of the work that the team has done and based upon recent market-share trends that show consumption is growing at four times the market, with particular strength behind children\u2019s TYLENOL and children\u2019s MOTRIN, the new strategies we\u2019ve implemented within the organization are really paying off.","Now the work that I just described is leveraging the full strength of our enterprise, the product portfolios, the expertise of our research, medical and epidemiological teams and our commercial organizations. Looking longer-term, our strategy for driving growth should be very familiar to all of you by now and I\u2019ll use the balance of my time taking you through some of the elements behind it. So let's start with innovation because in the end without innovation we just can\u2019t be successful that\u2019s ultimately how we\u2019re going to help more patients and consumers and we invested $8.5 billion in R&D last year across our segments to keep us at the forefront. Our approach can be viewed in these four ways. As I\u2019ve said earlier, we want to ensure we have the right mix of internally and externally sourced science and products and we\u2019ve built new innovation models.","We\u2019re also focusing on greater cross-segment collaboration to innovate and focused operationally on building market-leading capabilities that enable us to achieve the highest quality and efficiency standards possible across the world. And the good news is, it\u2019s working. We\u2019ve had about an 8% CAGR over the last 20 years and we\u2019ve invested almost $200 billion in innovation over that span. About 109 billion of that has been internal and about 85 billion has been external, so a pretty fair mix. With that external spend, we\u2019ve done over 120 deals and well over 100 of those are under $1 billion. Of course the larger ones make up more of the value, but what this graph shows is that you\u2019ve got to have those singles, doubles and triples as well as the larger home run type deals to be successful over the long-term. And that\u2019s helped us build a portfolio with 24 brands and platforms that generate over $1 billion and sell the piece.","As an example, our team has done a great job at this in the oncology space. The partnerships we\u2019ve built since 2008 have helped us grow from a $1 billion franchise to over $4.5 billion today and we have around four breakthrough designations in this portfolio demonstrating our ability to identify and develop products that can revolutionize the care of cancer patients. And we\u2019re doubling down on our efforts to ensure we continue accessing new ideas and products at their earlier stages. Building on the legacy of entrepreneurship that the Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation established since its inception by investing over $1 billion in start-up companies, the team made an additional 43 investments with nearly $200 million just last year. Our new innovation centers which are in four innovation hubs across the world have made over 200 alliances in the past few years and at our four no-strings-attached incubators at Janssen Labs, we\u2019re giving small start-ups places to work and access the instrumentation.","I had an opportunity to visit our facility in South San Francisco just last week and that was one of our teams that we\u2019re working with, who says it could have taken them eight years and $300 million to do what we\u2019re enabling them to do in just a couple of years for significantly less, in an environment where they are building a foundation for strong partnerships for themselves and frankly with us as well. As technologies are advancing, we\u2019re seeing more and more opportunities for cross-segment collaborations, bringing together the scientific, regulatory, clinical and commercial expertise from across Johnson & Johnson to improve care. Examples include our EVARREST Fibrin Sealant Patch, which has demonstrated an ability to control problematic surgical bleeding that goes well beyond the current standard of care. Stem cell therapy for Adult Macular Degeneration is another area that we\u2019re very excited about. We think it offers a great complement to our existing vision care platform.","Also while I was in China for the APEC Economic Leaders Summit in November, I announced plans to optimize our expertise on oncology to help the Chinese government fight lung cancer. It's estimated that by 2025 there will be 1 million cases of lung cancer and while China has 20% of the world\u2019s population, they have got about 30% of the cases. So we\u2019re in the process of establishing a China Lung Cancer Center which will adopt an integrated medical approach to transforming the disease we help ultimately into a preventable and curable one, by taking a unique local approach where we have R&D, medical device, pharmaceutical and consumer experts all working together to bring forward new and very comprehensive solutions. This is also a good illustration of the versatility of the types of enterprise-wide solutions we can uniquely offer as Johnson & Johnson and we\u2019re already in talks with governments and other nations to develop similar models to help them attack diseases that are rapidly spreading through their nations.","Now we realize that in order to implement programs like these on such a large scale, we must change the way we work as a Company. For many years Johnson & Johnson has been extremely decentralized and we think that accountability and responsibility is something that we don\u2019t want to lose or compromise. But we also realize that operating a $75 billion global company is different than operating a much smaller one and then making sure we\u2019ve got the right standards and systems in place in areas such as quality, supply chain and finance is essential. So we put in a very ambitious agenda to strike the right balance in our organization. And as I stated last year, we\u2019re aiming to take $1 billion out of our P&L over the next three years and believe that we\u2019ll be an even stronger organization. So all of our commitments to innovate have helped us establish a very strong pipeline for Johnson & Johnson. As you can see in our Pharmaceutical business we have a deep pipeline, and as I said earlier we\u2019re expecting the yield 10 major filings and 25 line extensions between 2013 and 2017.","One of them is esketamine, a potential breakthrough medication for treatment resistant depression as well as daratumumab which is being developed for multiple myeloma. They both have breakthrough designations from the FDA. We\u2019re also excited by ARN-509, a next-generation treatment for prostate cancer, as well as guselkumabfor Psoriasis and sirukumab which is for Rheumatoid Arthritis. And just yesterday, we announced that the FDA has granted priority review of our NDA supporting the three month formulation of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia. If approved, it will be the first and only long-acting atypical antipsychotic that can be dosed just four times a year, adding an unprecedented treatment option to help address the needs of these patients. We\u2019ll keep you apprised of these programs, as their development progresses.","Innovation is also deep in Medical Devices, where we expect 30 major filings between 2014 and 2016, including the ECHELON FLEX Powered Vascular Stapler and our TFN-ADVANCED Proximal Femoral Nailing System in trauma which we\u2019ll launch this year. We\u2019re also innovating medical devices for consumers like the new Calibra 3-Day Wearable Insulin Patch, as well as with our new brand of ACUVUE for use in the beauty and astigmatism and presbyopic segments.","And in our Consumer business, we have 20 key product launches planned for this year, including NEUTROGENA Hydro Boost and LISTERINE HEALTHY WHITE. Innovation though is not just about new products it\u2019s also about new ways of managing. More and more of what I\u2019m hearing from hospital CEOs and from healthcare administrators around the globe, is they want to work with Johnson & Johnson on a less fragmented basis, so we\u2019re implementing different approaches. To take on healthcare in the future, we\u2019re going to take a much more holistic approach and build more holistic partnerships and we\u2019re making it easier for health systems to do businesses with us through customer-focused team leaders that can represent an enterprise view. Again, when you think about the depth and the breadth that we have from orthopedics, to surgery, to the pharmaceutical group, our ability not only to contract, but to fundamentally partner price and work collaboratively in a different construct, it offers us a unique and exciting opportunity to be part of the solution in healthcare as it continue to change around the globe.","We also have a very strong global footprint and 53% of our total sales last year were made outside the United States, with about 21% in the fast moving emerging markets around the world where we see stronger growth rates than what we\u2019re seeing in developed markets. While these markets always represent a certain challenge or a certain risk, we\u2019ve been operating in them for many years and we believe that taking a long-term view is the right way for us, not only in terms of expanding our presence, but also in the way we conduct research and development and the way we embed elements of our supply chain in all the areas of our business, which is an important strength for us overall and which is helping us to drive us to this level of success.","Now while we\u2019ve talked a lot about ways in which we\u2019re building our portfolio, we also think it\u2019s important to make sure that we\u2019re being thoughtful about where we\u2019re going to participate and where we\u2019re not going to participate. Again, you\u2019ve seen some decisions that we made around areas such as drug-eluting stents, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, selecting pharmaceutical and consumer brands. Our approach is to focus on being number one or number two in a particular area, as well as on those businesses or product areas, that we feel have a path to achieving leadership where they will be directly complementary with one of our businesses. Now if a business or product doesn\u2019t meet at least one of those criteria for us, it maybe that it\u2019s better served in someone else\u2019s hands. To be clear, these can be very good businesses with a lot of opportunity such as the U.S. NUCYNTA pain brand, we just announced plans to divest or Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. The point is, that moves like these give us a chance to rejuvenate our portfolio and to focus on those programs that we know are ultimately going to help more patients and grow our business.","One other topic I\u2019d like to talk about before I close regards our efforts around Ebola, now in addition to the privilege of working in healthcare, we have a real responsibility to lead with purpose and to help the global community in times of crisis. Our work to expedite development of an Ebola vaccine is a great representation of our ability to mobilize and focus our resources in a really short period of time to help meet the needs of patients. And because everyday counts, we\u2019ve committed to substantially accelerate the production of our vaccine regimen through unprecedented collaborations among the global health community. Our goal is to bring this vaccine to families and frontline healthcare professionals, as fast as possible. We started our Phase 1 clinical trials and have produced more than 400,000 regimens for use in large scale clinical trials.","As I started this talk, I showed you a slide for my presentation last January, outlining what we expected to accomplish in 2014. So, we\u2019ll remain focused on our near-term priorities and continue to advance our longer-term growth drivers. And I look forward to reporting on our progress next January when we view our 2015 accomplishments.","As I close, I just want to emphasize why I\u2019m so confident in our business and our growth potential. First, our core businesses are strong and positioned to continue expanding their leadership positions. We have an exciting and deep product pipeline across the entire enterprise. And we\u2019re changing the way we interact with our customers and evolving our structure to be more effective and efficient to drive growth. Finally, I\u2019m privileged to work with some of the greatest people in the world and I believe that with the progress we\u2019ve made a sheer commitment to Our Credo and resolve in pursuit of our aspiration to help billions of people live longer, healthier, happier lives we\u2019re extremely well-positioned for the future.","Thank you and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CFO, Dominic Caruso.","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Alex and good morning everyone. It\u2019s a great pleasure to report on our excellent 2014 performance which was driven by the many successes that Alex previously discussed, as well as to provide guidance for you to consider as you update your models for 2015.","Now let\u2019s review some highlights of our full year and fourth quarter financial performance. Turning to the next slide you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year of 2014. At the beginning of 2014 we provided an outlook of our expected financial performance for the year and we saw continued improvement in our results throughout the year. That growth was driven by strong sales results, particularly in our Pharmaceutical business and also good expense management across the enterprise. And so we ended 2014 with full year sales growth of 4.2% with operational sales growth of 6.1%, which exceeded our initial guidance of 4% to 5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures our operational sales growth was a strong 8% for the year. While we did benefit from a significant level of sales of our Hepatitis C products, excluding both of these factors our operational sales growth for 2014 was approximately 5%. I am also pleased to report that our pre-tax operating margin for 2014, excluding the impact of special items, improved by 190 basis points with more than half of that coming from sales of OLYSIO. Finally, our net income margin excluding special items improved to 23%.","Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014. While our total sales change of negative 0.6% reflects a negative impact of currency movements, we\u2019re pleased to report operational sales growth of 3.9%, which as Louise discussed earlier was driven impart by the continued uptake of our recently launched pharmaceutical products. Excluding the impact of Hepatitis C products and acquisitions and divestitures operational sales growth was 5.6% for the quarter.","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. I am pleased to point out that we saw very good operating performance. Cost of goods sold was 40 basis points lower than the same period last year, primarily due to our product mix and cost improvement actions partly offset by currency impacts. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were down as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 as favorable mix of the business was partially offset by investments made in all areas of our business. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was up compared to the prior year, as we continue to make important investments for future growth and we closed a number of exciting licensing deals in the fourth quarter. Overall, our pre-tax operating margin excluding special items decreased 60 basis points in the fourth quarter, as compared to the prior year due to the timing of these investments during the fourth quarter.","Interest expense net of interest income of approximately 122 million was slightly higher than the prior year. Other income net of other expenses was $963 million of expense in the quarter compared to $868 million of expense in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are included in this line item, other income net of other expenses showed a net gain of approximately 103 million for the quarter, versus net expense of approximately 47 million in the prior year.","In the quarter, the effective tax rate excluding special items was 8% compared to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and for the year excluding special items tax rate was 19.3% compared to 17.2% for 2013. This was primarily due to the geographic mix of the results in each of the periods. This effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes the federal R&D tax credit for all of 2014, which we had anticipated would be passed Congress and in fact was late in 2014. This was included in our guidance but not yet in our reported results, therefore the entire full year credit is now reflected in the results for the quarter.","Now turning to the boxed section at the bottom of the slide, during the fourth quarter we recorded several special items that netted to an approximate $1.1 billion charge on an after-tax basis and consisted primarily of the following items; increased litigation accruals, cost associated with the Synthes acquisition which is consistent with what we expected will be incurred as special items throughout 2014 and which we expect to continue through the middle of 2015 as that integration activity wraps-up and some charges for in-process research and development. Together, these special items negatively impacted our fourth quarter results by $0.38 per share. Excluding these special items our adjusted earnings per share were a $1.27 for the fourth quarter, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by Firstcall despite the increased currency headwinds in the quarter which I will discuss later.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. I\u2019d like to start by first providing some context which we believe is important to consider regarding our guidance for 2015. First, as a reminder as we discussed last year and although we took opportunity to invest in the business with the increase in profitability from OLYSIO sales, our earnings in 2014 did benefit by approximately $0.20 per share even after those investments. Also as we did throughout 2014 we will provide a view of our sales growth excluding the impact of Hepatitis C, as well as acquisitions and divestitures, which as you know are both important when considering the underlying base business performance.","Additionally, currency headwinds have increased quite substantially since we last spoke with you in October of 2014, negatively impacting both sales and earnings and our guidance for 2015 to a greater extent that we had anticipated. We know that that some of you have updated your models for currency, but many of you had not yet and even though that have updated for currency have not yet reflected a negative impact that current rates could have if they were to remain at recent levels for all of 2015. And finally, we have decided to exclude amortization of intangibles from our adjusted earnings guidance consistent with the majority of our competitors and which I will discuss in more detail shortly.","Before I discuss sales and earnings, I\u2019ll give you some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast beginning with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the year, we had approximately $14.3 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $33.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $18.8 billion of debt. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I\u2019d suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a gain, ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which includes the anticipated gain from the divestiture of our U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine. As announced last week, we anticipate this transaction to close in the second quarter. This is a higher level of other income and some of you may have modeled and higher than the prior year level and we expect to use this increase in other income to compensate for lower level of income from OLYSIO, which we expect in 2015 as compared to what we had in 2014, allowing for continued investments in our core business primarily in research and development.","Now a word on taxes, our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will also be renewed by Congress for 2015, although that has still not yet happened. We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015 excluding special items of approximately 20% to 21%. If the R&D tax credit is not approved it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015.","Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2015 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models. For sales, our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. We are however expecting the generic entrant for INVEGA in the first half of 2015, as well as biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe in early 2015 and have included the expected impact in our sales guidance.","As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our results in 2014, our operational sales growth for 2015 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, as well as the impact of Hepatitis C would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014 which we noted earlier.","Throughout the latter part of 2014, the euro, like many other currencies weakened significantly versus the dollar and as of last week was lower by approximately 11% as compared to 2014 average levels. As you know, the dollar strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year, then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 5.5% reflecting the recent weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range between negative 3.5% and negative 4.5% for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $71 billion and $72 billion.","Now turning to earnings, consistent with the reporting practices by the majority of our competitors, beginning in 2015 we will exclude intangible amortization expense in addition to special items when providing our adjusted earnings guidance and actual results. The impact of the amortization of intangible assets that we\u2019re projecting is approximately $1.3 billion on a pre-tax basis representing approximately $0.32 per share on an after-tax basis for 2015, compared to $0.42 per share in 2014. The amount for 2014 includes the acceleration of the amortization expense on certain intangible assets which we don\u2019t anticipate for 2015 at this time.","To assist you in comparing our guidance to our models and to our prior year results, I will first describe our adjusted earnings guidance excluding special items as we have done in the past. Then I will update that guidance but also exclude the impact of amortization of intangibles. A significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions, which although hedged is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 50 to 70 basis points in 2015, as compared to 2014. I will of course discuss the translation impact of currency on EPS in a few minutes.","Consistent with our prior year presentation of adjusted EPS excluding special items, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS excluding special items ranging between $6.22 and $6.37 per share on a constant currency basis, up approximately 4.2% to 6.7%, compared to a constant currency sales growth rate of 1% to 2%. Now excluding the impact of amortization of intangibles in addition to excluding special items, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range between $6.54 and $6.69 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 2.3% to 4.7%. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week then our reported EPS excluding the intangible amortization expense of special items would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.42 per share, a much higher negative impact that we provided back in October of $0.15 to $0.20 per share due to the significant strengthening of the U.S dollar during the past several months. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS guidance excluding the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items would be in a range between $6.12 and $6.27 per share, reflecting the significant headwind of currency on EPS, if exchange rates were to stay where they are now for all of 2015. At this early stage in the year we would comfortable with your models reflecting the mid-point of this range.","So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided and reflecting on the context I shared with you earlier, I would like to make a few key points; although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2% we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of Hepatitis C and acquisitions and divestures our operational sales growth at the mid-point of our guidance would be 6% for 2015, as compared to 5% for 2014. We expect that the higher level of other income in our guidance for 2015 will replace the lower level of income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014, allowing for continued investment in the business particularly in research and development as we continue to build our pipeline. The negative impact of currency exchange rates in 2015 as compared to 2014 will be much more significant to both sales and earnings that many of you have modeled. And we expect that this additional negative currency impact to be more significant in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year.","On a constant currency basis our operational EPS growth and our guidance is expected to range between 2.3% and 4.7%. And finally going forward as we noted today, we will be reporting our adjusted earnings per share to exclude intangible amortization expense, as well as special items consistent with the majority of our competitors. So in closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our strong results for 2014 and we have the financial strength and breadth to execute on our near-term priority and to continue to deliver solid results, while also continuing to invest for long-term growth and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.","Thank you and now I\u2019d like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the program. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. To assist you with updating your models with comparative 2014 adjusted EPS excluding intangible amortization and special items we have posted a reconciliation by-quarter to the Web site. We will now open the call to your questions. Lhea, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Let me ask two to Alex. Alex let me just start off with the nearly 14 billion in net cash that you have that\u2019s close to the largest for J&J in recent years but you\u2019ve been relatively, you\u2019ve done relatively small deals since taking over as the CEO. Is there any color you can provide on your appetite to do a larger deal and your priorities for M&A? And then I have one follow-up question for you.","Alex Gorsky","Larry consistent with our strategy, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities frankly that help us better fulfill unmet medical need and so if we start with our pharmaceutical area I think over the past several years we\u2019ve done a really nice job of identifying compounds early on in that development, things like ZYTIGA, things like ibrutinib, bringing them in, putting them through a very rapid and extensive clinical development program and then of course having successful launches. And as we've experienced 14 new product launches since 2009. So we think in the pharmaceutical area that kind of approach to sourcing new technology and new compounds is definitely a successful one.","If we look to our Medical Devices, of course our big focus over the past in making sure that we're making the most of the significant investment that we made in Synthes. And I think we made a lot of headways I outlined during my presentation and in fact I think we were one of the first companies to really look hard at spaces like orthopedics and recognize that consolidation was very likely to occur and so we were able to do that in a way where we feel we got a very good portfolio fit. And as we\u2019ve managed through that transition over the past several years, we feel that we're in a very good position now particularly as many of our competitors are just starting to go through some of those consolidation initiatives. But even in this space we continue to look for new options, new innovations. There is number of spaces, we\u2019ve identified areas such as orthopedics, such as surgical, such as vision care in particular to be significant priorities for us and we continue to look in those spaces.","If we look to consumer, our top priority over the last several years frankly has been on remediating our over-the-counter brands, particularly here in the United States. And I really commend the team for the great work they have done. The McNeil Group has basically completed the major steps, the consent decree so they are on a very good path, they are re-launching brands you see it in our results for the quarter. But here too we continue to look for ways to innovate, continue to look for ways to add scale and expand in the appropriate way. And of course while we're doing that we're also making sure that we're being very disciplined and decisive about businesses that we're choosing not to participate in. And I think we made a number of moves over the last several years that also has allowed us to continue to invest, but has also been healthy for the shareholders at the same time.","Lawrence Biegelsen","And then Alex I know this may seem like an overly simplistic question, but over the past 15 years J&J\u2019s pharma business has gone through three, roughly five year cycles with the first five being strong, followed by a deceleration due to patent expiration, followed by another five strong years or so. And when one looks at the pharma business one can't help but see increasing competition to key products like ZYTIGA and STELARA, as well as the biosimilar competition that you highlighted on the call which will slow your overall pharma growth. So my question is how confident are you that you can break those five year cycles we've seen over the past 15 years and why? Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","And look I am very proud of our Pharmaceutical business, and frankly the work that they have done over the past five or six years to address as you highlighted the significant patent expiry challenge that we experienced and that we successfully navigated our way through. When you think about it, we lost about $8.5 billion to patent expiration several years ago and we took a determined strategy that frankly was different than a lot of our competitors where we decided to focus on five major therapeutic areas where we had capabilities and frankly where we still felt there was a lot of unmet medical need. We got very agnostic about the sourcing of our research. At the end of the day we wanted the best molecule, the best science where we felt we could make the biggest difference and then of course it was about how do you build robust clinical development programs and then ultimately have benchmark commercial and reimbursement teams to make sure that you are maximizing all of those compounds. And if you look at the track record as I mentioned earlier, 14 compounds since 2009, six of those have reached a $1 billion and again these are compounds that are really making a difference for patients.","But at the same time, we have made a very strong commitment to make sure that while we were launching those, we were also investing in the future. And here I really want to commend our scientific team, our business development team because if you look at our near-term pipeline I think it's quite encouraging. We've got things like ARN-509, another approach in androgen receptor inhibitors that we think will be a great compliment with ZYTIGA in the not too distant future. To complement an already very strong immunology franchise with REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI, we have got sirukumab an IL-6 in patients for RA and guselkumab an IL-23 that's an antibody for psoriasis both of those are progressing very well through development stages as well.","We have got a very interesting compound fulranumab an anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritic pain. We have been in pain for some time, but we think this will be a definite new approach for patients and we've also got esketamine, you have heard some of the data on that. It\u2019s the first NMDA antagonist and these are from patients with treatment-refractory depression, a really difficult condition with high rates of suicidality. And we see very good results, again it's early, we have more work to do but we're quite encouraged. So if we add that to the very strong platforms and you\u2019ve heard earlier in my presentation that we\u2019ve had over 20 line extensions approved in 2014 of our existing compounds, we\u2019ve submitted at least that many more that we\u2019ll see approved over the next several years. And when you look at some of the areas where we\u2019re currently participating, be it prostate cancer, be it Type 2 diabetes and some of the other areas such as thrombosis we\u2019re seeing many of these areas growing at double-digits and areas like XARELTO, I think we\u2019ve penetrated perhaps a third of the warfarin market. So we think there is strong growth opportunities in our core business, we think we\u2019ve got exciting line extensions and we think we\u2019ve got a great coming pipeline of Phase 3 and Phase 2 compounds for the future.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung","Alex, you spent a lot of time highlighting the successes that you\u2019ve had in pharma which we would agree you\u2019ve done a great job and seemingly finding kind of secret sauce there in terms of both external and internal innovation. I am wondering if you have any thoughts on how translatable that formula is over to your medical device business, which has continued to -- you struggled to grow above market and maybe could talk about if there are any learnings there that could be translated over to Medical Devices and what it will take either internally or externally for you to get that Medical Device business growing above market?","Alex Gorsky","And first of all, clearly we acknowledge our Medical Device Group has faced challenges that many of the businesses have over the past several years and we\u2019ve got some very promising and I think very strong stories in our Medical Device Group and when you think about our EP business BioSense Webster and the growth rate that this experienced, I think we\u2019d now -- we have about 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth for that business, a continues and constant stream of innovation, ultimately really helping patients in growing our business, it's impressive by almost any measure. I think we\u2019ve also started to see some of our other core businesses come back and grow. We think about the Medical Device market probably growing in the 3% to 5% range, it's been consistent with our longer-term projections. Of course our goal is to outpace that growth because we want to gain share vis-\u00e0-vis innovation, the way we work with customers in our broader portfolio.","If I look across other areas, we\u2019re starting I think to see signs of a strengthening orthopedics performance by DePuy Synthes. For example we saw hips up around 4%, knees up 3%, trauma growing at the high 4s, almost 5% and we think our share performance has been very good in all of those different areas. We saw energy also on a full year basis come back over 5%, even our Suture business is growing over 3% on an annual basis. So we think those are strong performers and can continue. And then of course we have some businesses that we\u2019re working hard on, areas such as diabetes which as you know was challenged by the price setbacks, our Vision Care business is facing challenges in the marketplace, but they have done a lot of good changes recently and we think they are well-positioned for the future.","But as we look even longer-term, clearly we\u2019re trying to take pages from the innovation playbook that you might say our pharma group is built on and apply those in other areas. So whether it's in our clinical development programs, the way we monitor safety, adverse event reporting, those are areas we\u2019re spending a lot of time. We\u2019re doing more and more through our innovation centers that we\u2019re recently opening and utilizing JJDC on how do we better source early start-up innovation. Again in the pharma as well as the device but even our Consumer businesses going forward and of course we\u2019re looking at ways also to partner with customer in new unique ways. So, we remain confident in our Medical Device businesses, we\u2019ve got some very strong businesses, we\u2019ve got -- we realize there is others that we still have more work to do, but we think long-term they offer a significant opportunity for patients, for us and for our shareholders.","Derrick Sung","I was wondering Alex also if you could follow-up a bit on your comments on healthcare utilization. You\u2019d mentioned that now you're seeing a couple quarters of sequential uptick in healthcare utilization. Can you perhaps break that down a bit by geography and give us your outlook and also what you're seeing in the U.S. versus Europe versus the emerging markets and how you -- what you see the drivers are for utilization as we look out to 2015 and beyond?","Alex Gorsky","As you know because of our presence in pharmaceuticals, as well as devices and even consumer it gives us a pretty good lens to understand what\u2019s going on fundamentally in the market. So let me start in the United States where you probably have the clearest and the most tangible data and here we\u2019re encouraged, we think we\u2019ve got about three quarters now in the positive, when I say in the positive I mean somewhere between 2% and 3% when we\u2019re looking at hospital admissions, surgical procedures, physician office visits still appear to be negative. So I think it's too early to declare complete victory yet, but generally I would say we\u2019re encouraged by some of the signs that we\u2019re seeing and if we can see the fourth quarter, the full results coming out for this year and have a third quarter then of increasing results that would be a positive.","I think one of the areas of challenge for us has been Europe. There remain obviously a lot of concerns economically in Europe. We have some businesses frankly that are doing quite well. We have others that are challenged. I think it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. We continue to see good growth in China on a full year basis. We saw over 10% -- double-digit growth in China and close to that in the BRIC regions although obviously with Russia, that\u2019s been particularly challenged over the last year given some of the things that we faced. South America a little bit more with Venezuela. Brazil has been a little bit mixed. We saw some challenges on our Consumer segment and some of the other areas. We haven\u2019t felt that as much, but I think that\u2019s a global sense that we give you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","So Dominic let me start with you if you don\u2019t mind, so I just want to walk through the kind of approach to numbers this year, so you have starting point for on a cash EPS basis of $6.39 for 2014, but then you lose $0.42 in FX let\u2019s call it $0.20 from OLYSIO, but then the other income step up from '14 to '15 adds extra $1 billion gains of about $0.30, is that how to think about it? And then and if that\u2019s right it would still seem to imply relatively conservative underlying EPS growth outlook of about 1% to 3% so is there anything I\u2019m missing there?","Dominic Caruso","I think the impact of the higher other income and expense line I mean you have to think about that as utilizing the tax rate that\u2019s predominantly U.S. versus our blended tax rate I would say that the impacts lower than $0.30 a share and closer to $0.20 to $0.22 a share. Just think about a $1 billion at a 35% tax rate and 6.50 and do the math on that, so I don\u2019t think you get the 0.30 on that, so I would adjust that a little bit. And then I would just give you maybe another macro observation Mike and that is that if you -- I know that not everyone has updated their models for all of the moving parts here, but I think if you -- when I look to consensus at about 6.14 and then I consider the fact that we should add back to that $0.32 of this amortization expense and then reduce it by what I\u2019m using as about $0.24 which is the difference between $0.42 that I just discussed and the midpoint of what we provided as an estimate back in October between $0.15 and $0.20 so that call that 0.18, so an incremental $0.24. So 6.14 plus 0.32 minus 0.24 gets you to in the 6.20 range. And so we\u2019re thinking that that\u2019s about apart from the expectation on currency about where everyone had sort of expected us to come out.","Mike Weinstein","But with the let me fast forward then into 2016 so, we should assume that that level of other income benefit fade in 2016, so is that a bit of a headwind as we\u2019re trying to update our model going from '15 but to '16?","Dominic Caruso","Well I think that as Alex has talked about and I\u2019ve mentioned in other calls and you all have asked us about, we\u2019re continuing to review our portfolio. We expect that we will continue to make choices of that areas we\u2019re going to play in and areas we\u2019re not going to play in. Where we want to invest and where we think others certain assets maybe better in the hands of others. And when we do that and we divest certain businesses as a result of that analysis, we tend to use those divestiture gains to basically benefit shareholders. So we either use it to invest in other more promising activities that we think will give us a better boost in long-term growth or in fact we deliver a higher level of earnings as a result and of course as we did with OCD, if there\u2019s any dilutive impact of that on a go-forward basis we would then adjust for that with share buybacks and alike. So I would say that, I wouldn\u2019t take '15 as sort of an abnormal number and I wouldn\u2019t just say would fade into '16, it all depends on what choices we make when we evaluate our portfolio going forward.","Mike Weinstein","Let me ask one if I can sneak in one bigger picture question so if I pick up your noise from OLYSIO the underlying growth in the business is accelerating in your guidance for 2015, could you just comment on that so what businesses are you assuming get better between pharma and medical devices and consumer?","Dominic Caruso","Yes well overall I would say that the growth rate in pharma ex-OLYSIO will be slightly softer than it was the prior year as these products have now ramped up in the marketplace. So the medical device business overall and the consumer business are expected to have better growth prospects in '15 than we saw in '14.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Two questions for Alex. First, Alex can you describe your commitment to your cardiovascular device business? And the reason I\u2019m asking is that there was something written up a few months ago that J&J maybe thinking about selling the interventional cardiology business but not the electrophysiology business, so commitment to Cardiovascular. And then as a follow-up, what is your commitment to the Triple A rating, in other words how sacred is the Triple A rating? And the reason I am asking that is because as your competitors are getting bigger and bigger is better according to some of your competitors, if J&J were to see a deal that was larger but it would sacrifice the Triple A rating, would J&J do such a deal? Thank you.","Alex Gorsky","Look Glenn I think that if you ask me about cardiovascular my response is that, we think cardiovascular is an important area. We have done very well over the last several years in our EP business as I mentioned earlier. And I think by any standard if you look at the way they have been able to advance the standard of care, if you take a look at the new technology, the innovation rollouts and frankly the execution of that business it has been superlative in just about every mark, and we\u2019re really proud of that. We made decisions in other areas of the cardiovascular, such as our decision on drug-eluting stents several years ago. We\u2019ve continued to look at emerging areas in cardiovascular, but I think overall we want to participate in areas where we\u2019ve got technology that we think can really make a difference for patients, where we think the markets are promising for the future in terms of reaching more patients, expanding share, volume growth, some pricing stability. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate our portfolio to make sure that we\u2019re consistent with our strategy and as it relates to cardiovascular.","If we talk about our Triple A, look we\u2019re proud of the fact that we\u2019re only one of the handful of companies that still have Triple A rating. It gives us a lot of financial flexibility. As an organization when you realize that we literally have almost no covenants, and the way that we\u2019re able to manage our business for an enterprise of our size and frankly for the sustainability of our performance over a very long period of time, we think that\u2019s important. However, what we would also say if we came upon technology that we felt was truly transformational that opened up new patient segments for us, new opportunities that is one factor that we would consider as we think as we would think about different acquisitions or different opportunities. So it\u2019s one among many factors, it is very important to us, but it\u2019s not the only factor that we would judge a strategic option by the future.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Halford, Jefferies.","Jeff Halford","So we are seeing quite of contracting pressure in some areas of pharma. I just wanted to get a bit of color from you whether XARELTO is a product that you are potentially starting to get any more serious discussions with Eliquis becoming a much more penetrated within the U.S. market? And then also just INVOKANA as well just what the situation is like there? Just from a contracting perspective. And then second just give a bit more color on what kind of impacts you have expected within your guidance for REMICADE within Europe from biosimilars? And then just lastly if you can just give us a bit more color on the increase in the litigation accrual you described in your release? Thank you.","Alex Gorsky","Let me start off with the first one and then I\u2019ll ask Dominic to chime in on the other couple of questions. And first of all, we take a very broad look in the very early stages of our compound development on what potential impact or scenarios we could face regarding pricing and reimbursement, and so it starts very early with the science. And as I mentioned earlier in my commentary about our pharmaceutical strategy, we think taking a very high innovation approach in pharma is the right approach and it certainly has been the one most successful for us. And so part of it starts with selecting compounds that we feel have a strong probability of differentiation versus current standards of care and we think that\u2019s certainly the case with XARELTO and INVOKANA. Secondly it really gets in your clinical development programs. And if you look at the XARELTO clinical development program that we had, I believe we had more than 60,000 patients as part of our plan, extensive studies as you know we have got more than five indications for that, literally at launch or very soon thereafter once-a-day dosing. And so as part of our development program and the labeling we had a very comprehensive approach. And we think that that clearly played a strong role in its rapid launch uptake.","And I think the same for a drug like INVOKANA. If you take a look at the comparative labeling that we have versus Januvia regarding HbA1c reduction, regarding weight loss, other parameters, that\u2019s enabled us to have a very differentiated and strong dasia to share with decision makers, payors around the world. So as a result what we think now not only have we seen strong acceptance but we have seen good formulary uptake. XARELTO for example in the United State is available on I believe more than 90% of the commercial as well as Medicare and Medicaid programs. We see the very strong uptake with INVOKANA, I think it\u2019s somewhere around 70% or 80% even in most cases. And we\u2019ve had good success outside of the United States as well. And so we think it takes again a very good clinical development program, strong labeling, very strong reimbursement and commercial expertise. And so that\u2019s the way we think about those compounds. We haven\u2019t seen additional pressures as of late but we certainly see competitive pressures. But we feel very good about our compounds that we\u2019re frankly still in the launch stage of and their potential for future growth, Dom?","Dominic Caruso","Yes Jeff, with respect to REMICADE in Europe as you know we don\u2019t provide specific product sales guidance on any product and particularly with REMICADE in Europe as you probably know Merck is our partner for distribution in Europe and the countries affected by biosimilar competition in the beginning of February 2015. So I think the question is best posed to them. One thing I would say though is that we have a view on how biosimilars are likely to unfold in the marketplace which is unlike how typical generic chemical compounds unfold in the marketplace. And our best experience there was with PROCRIT and Eprex in Europe. So using that as a guide, we felt pretty comfortable updating our guidance to reflect our expectation of that, but we won\u2019t give very specific guidance on any product in particular.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Dominic, I just wanted to just go back and reconfirm the other income commentary. So you are including the gain from NUCYNTA and going forward you said it would be likely that we would continue to see these gains on the sale of asset divestitures. Is that correct?","Dominic Caruso","Right. And so we did include that in this year\u2019s guidance and in response to Mike\u2019s question where he said would it fade off in 2016 I commented that consistent with our review of our portfolio and making decisions on where we\u2019re going to invest and where we\u2019re not, if we decided to divest other assets as part of that review then we would have similar type transaction gains in the particular year. And we would highlight them to you as we\u2019re doing today.","Kristen Stewart","And this year $0.20 to $0.22 just for that after-tax?","Dominic Caruso","I think if you look at the change in our guidance on other income and expense compared to what you all have modeled it\u2019s about $1 billion after-tax of 35% gets you to about $0.20-$0.22 per share impact versus current models.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then just kind of I guess more business operational. Can you just talk a little bit just about the surgery business you highlighted it has being a key area of focus within Medical Devices with some new products coming up. Can you just refresh us on your stance on robotics and what products you have within the pipeline that you\u2019re most excited about in 2015?","Alex Gorsky","Look, we\u2019re excited about the broad area of surgery and as you know we break it out both by specialty surgery, as well as surgical care. And what I would start within specialty surgery, there is a number of areas that I think are great opportunities one is certainly energy. We\u2019ve had a number of new launches this year that I think have resulted in about over 5%-5.2% full year growth rate in that franchise. We think there is a lot of opportunity going forward. We also saw very good performance from our Mentor business this year it grew it almost 9% after a couple of years of a lot of challenges. It came back strong and so we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve seen there.","And finally our bio-surgery business, which is the one that we also think can really revolutionize the way bleeding is controlled intraoperatively. We saw over 8% growth in it for the quarter, so by and large that segment of our surgical business is doing well. There we\u2019re continuing to address some issues at ASP but our team has made a lot of headway there so we\u2019re confident about that platform as well going forward. If I look more broadly in our other surgical business, we saw suture grow over 3% which was nice year-on-year growth in that particular area. We think that\u2019s a good pre-cursor of what you see generally across all of surgery in the ENDOPATH area or ECHELONFLEX portfolio is also being introduced and is doing better. Clearly in certain areas there we\u2019re facing pricing pressure. But overall, we think that the surgical area both in specialty as well as more general surgery offers a significant opportunity for us.","Kristen Stewart","And with respect to robotics?","Alex Gorsky","Regarding robotics, look as Gary mentioned during last year\u2019s review of our Medical Device space, we think the areas of robotics visualization particularly if some of those components become more inherent to the instrumentation of themselves. We do think that they can offer opportunities. We\u2019ve got several partnerships there as we speak. And we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to think about how that\u2019s going to impact surgery going forward.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Alex more a kind of a high level question on international if we think about the last three years '13 growth rate\u2019s a little slower than '12-'14 growth rates looks slower than '13. Even the second half '14 was slower than first half '14. Given you\u2019re kind of focused on global reach can you just describe why international is decelerating, is it emerging markets and what\u2019s the strategy to turn that around? And then I have a quick follow-up?","Alex Gorsky","Look there is a lot of different moving parts so let me talk about it. I think first of all let\u2019s talk about Europe, in Europe we saw contraction initially then Europe actually performed better. As I mentioned earlier in the guidance going forward we\u2019re watching it closely and even there you\u2019ve got Southern Europe versus Northern Europe. We continue to see Northern Europe performing slightly better than the rest of Europe it\u2019s been impacted in the most recent quarter by Russia in a significant way. So that\u2019s a watch out although we have had some of our businesses such as our consumer group do relatively well in Russia. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching closely. China we continue to see pretty solid growth for our businesses our Medical Device business is the most significant in that they may continue to see good growth there. Our consumer group has had some other challenges that we don\u2019t think necessarily are related to the macroeconomic environment and frankly they have to do with some of our own products and ingredients. But we think that we\u2019re on a better path there. And then if I look to South America we\u2019ve been most challenged there, in Venezuela. Brazil definitely we feel there was some slowdown in the back end of the year. And we\u2019re just going to have to watch it closely as we head into 2015.","Dominic Caruso","David just one thing to remind you about when you said it slowed down further in the back of '14 compared to first half of '14 just a reminder that the divesture of the OCD business would have impacted that comparison as well.","Alex Gorsky","Yes.","David Lewis","And maybe just a quick one for Dominic and then a strategic one for Alex if I can sneak that one in, Dominic just I know it\u2019s hard with all the moving pieces do you have any sense of what you consider the underlying operating margin expansion to be for the business in 2015? And then Alex just strategically just thinking to your comments in the slide deck this morning is it safe to interpret your comments that within pharmaceuticals, oncology probably sees an increase relative investment over the next couple of years relatively to historical periods? Thank you I\u2019ll jump back in queue.","Dominic Caruso","Sure David just in terms of operating margin expansion in '15 just to set the stage for you, remember we expanding our operating profit margin by 190 basis points in 2014. So we\u2019re already at a pretty high level and we wanted to continue the investment and we said we would use the divesture gain that\u2019s included in our OI&E number for NUCYNTA to offset the lost profitability on OLYSIO and by doing that we\u2019re going to maintain the level of investment that we now have achieved. So an incremental operating margin expansion in 2015 would be very modest.","Alex Gorsky","And David I would say we are really focused on all five of our therapeutic categories. Oncology is certainly an exciting one and when you look at the science and what\u2019s happening there we think that there is a lot of opportunity to better address need for patients. We think there is a lot of very interesting science, but also when we look at immunology when we look at infectious disease, when we look at neuroscience, as well as broader spaces in cardiovascular and diabetes, we think that all of those offer significant potential for us.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Wise, Stifel.","Rick Wise","Alex maybe as a start a little more detail with diabetes if you would it\u2019s been underperforming asset maybe just broadly what do you need to turn around and let me touch on a couple of points. Remind us when you had received the price cuts, Vibe approved and launching here we\u2019ve heard great things about it in Europe. Is that going to be a good product feed for what we expect to see in the U.S and maybe you had a picture of the caliber patch? Remind us when you hope to file and get that approved and launched in the United States?","Alex Gorsky","Diabetes is clearly one of those areas Rick where you know and we would add several conversations on this. There are 350 million Type 2 diabetics around the world and so many of them not in control. There is a lot of unmet need. But we also realize it\u2019s been a very challenging market particularly in the areas of the part of the market that we\u2019ve been in for the last several years. So Louise is going to get the exact date when we lapped it.","Louise Mehrotra","The price changes went into effect about a year ago June. But you\u2019re still seeing the impact of them and you saw them earlier in the year and you\u2019re still seeing some of them.","Alex Gorsky","And look for a very significant portion of our market we saw over a 70% price reduction and as you know whenever that happens in one of your businesses you frankly have got to reframe that entire business. And I think all of the companies involved in SMBG have gone through that kind of transition over the last year and a half. If we look at the underlying fundamentals things such as volume share, we\u2019ve actually done a very good job. We\u2019ve done a very good job in managed care contracting. So as a result we\u2019ve been able to keep our volumes up, our costs under control. But nonetheless that business is completely had to reshape itself and there are still in the process of I think getting it stabilized. We are excited about the Vibe approval. We think that\u2019s going to represent a real nice breakthrough for patients over in Europe we\u2019ve had strong results. We\u2019re putting together the launch literally as we speak, so we\u2019re excited about that. We think Calibra could be a very nice opportunity very unobtrusive way to have insulin delivery. And it looks right now by the year -- backend of the year 2016 we should have more on that. So again overall diabetes is an area that we feel strongly about and by the way this is the same team that had a very significant role in the launch of INVOKANA as well. And we think the relationships that they have built with the endocrinologists have been quite important for us in the long success of that brand as well. So it's an area that we're interested in but clearly one that's changed and we still have more work to do to make sure we understand the best path forward.","Rick Wise","And Dominic just one question for you, the $1 billion cost reduction program it sounds like the new one -- newly incremental one if I understood you over three years. Just help us briefly where did that come from, what operating lines does it affect and is it incremental or you reinvested? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","We actually talked about it last year at this time as well, so it's not a new program, it's just the same program we discussed and we're confident that we will get about a $1 billion over the next three year period. It's in the area of IT, finance, HR all the functions that support the businesses, how we perform those services, where we perform those services and as Alex mentioned earlier some more standardization and commonality across the businesses through shared service environment. You\u2019ll see it across the SG&A line in particular but we would always look to see what the right balance is of investing versus delivering those cost savings of course we do expect pricing pressure to continue so this was a good hedge against that as well Rick.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Just a follow-up to an earlier question I think from Jeff on INVOKANA and XARELTO some of the contracting issues. Just curious about the specialty care markets so certainly the TNFs and you are going to see obviously a lot of discussion on pricing and primary care and have seen but are you seeing anything more in the specialty care areas specifically in autoimmune how has that changed kind of over the last six to 12 months from what you have seen before?","Alex Gorsky","Alex here, we haven't seen any significant changes over the last six or 12 months. And again we've got a lot of experience in those areas with REMICADE, SIMPONI, and STELARA. And I think the team has done a nice job in managing the overall value of pricing and reimbursement issues but we haven't seen any noticeable changes in that environment.","Vamil Divan","Okay. And then just one follow-up if I could is on the tax side. We had the lower rate this time and you mentioned for '15. How should we think about just longer-term tax planning, I mean is the range you are giving now, what would you kind of assume going forward are there other steps that can lower your longer-term rate?","Alex Gorsky","Well I think Vamil we're always doing prudent tax planning and I think the ultimate change in tax rates would come from hopefully corporate tax reform being implemented. In which case if you project that I would then project a slightly higher effective tax rate and of course the utilization of all U.S cash et cetera without penalty is a great benefit that arises from that. So I can't give you a long-term projection but you have seen that we've been sort of in the 20% range for quite some time and that I think it's a solid place if you just want to model it for now.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. And we will take our final question from Danielle.","Operator","Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy, Leerink Partners.","Danielle Antalffy","As we -- so appreciating all the headwinds that are impacting growth in 2015, how do we think about sort of medium-term growth for '16-'17. And what's in the pipeline to return the Company back to growth this is sort of following-up on Larry's question Alex on specifically the pharma company and going through a few years of strong growth and a few years of decelerating growth. What's in the pipeline that gives you confidence that 2015 is sort of a one-off where you observe headwinds from OLYSIO specifically and then of course FX?","Alex Gorsky","Look I would say first of all, we think that there is significant growth left in our core brands. And as I mentioned earlier whether you look at the penetration that you have within a particular therapeutic category for Actavis the new novel mechanisms in against warfarin for example. If you look at the penetration of the SGLT2 versus other options in diabetes and frankly the growth rates of the market in areas such as prostate cancer or some of the leukemias, we think there is a lot of growth opportunities just from reaching more patients. Number two, it's about getting additional indications and line extensions. And so I think our team has done also a very nice job there in continuing to reinforce introducing new data, new information, new approaches, that whether it's combination therapies, whether it's something like our three month version of Paliperidone that we just announced that we know in a condition such as schizophrenia could have a tremendous impact if you can keep compliance high on just four injections a year. We think I in that core business it gives us a very solid opportunity with the line extensions.","And then of course if we look beyond that, some of the compounds that I mentioned earlier, we think ARN-509 will be a great complement with ZYTIGA and we\u2019re learning more and more about that and we\u2019re becoming increasingly confident as we gather more data. In immunology, our IL-6 and IL-23 with Sirukumab and Guselkumab will be great additions to a portfolio where we\u2019ve already got three compounds and we know very well clinically, we know very well commercially as well as from a reimbursement perspective. And finally, Esketamine, while still early, we\u2019re very encouraged by the data, we really are encouraged by the fact that we\u2019ve seen whether we\u2019ve received breakthrough therapy designation as well as Daratumumab in pain. So we think those in addition to our line extensions and additional indications that we\u2019ll be gathering, remember we filed more than 20 different line extensions over the course of 2014. We have 11 compounds in Phase 2 development, I think we\u2019ve got 50 compounds in early development more than 100 in discovery in addition to the ongoing licensing flow that we were able to build this year, I think it gives us a lot of confidence in our portfolio going forward.","Danielle Antalffy","And then if I could just follow-up really quickly with the question on the device side of things, so obviously we\u2019re nearing a close of one of your competitors or two of your competitors emerging and a mega transaction here making a big bet on breadth and scale across the hospital and bundling et cetera. So just wondering how you guys are planning to respond to that, how you think the environment could change from a purchasing perspective at the hospital level with the Medtronic Covidien deal once it closes?","Alex Gorsky","Yes I guess what I would say Danielle is we wouldn\u2019t respond to that necessarily, I think we initiated probably some of it with our move several years ago, when we started down this path ourselves. And we\u2019ve been pretty steadfast on our strategy one it's about innovation and that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to invest in innovation in all of our core Medical Device businesses. We do think that having scale in the right areas is also important as payors, and as hospital systems want to deal with you differently. And then it's about having also a very good geographical presence so that you can expand globally. And we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to add the right new technology or the right business to ours and that\u2019s the path that we\u2019ll stay on.","Alex Gorsky","Okay. Alright everybody thank you again for joining today\u2019s call and together with Dominic and Louise I look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress over the course of the year and I am sure we\u2019ll be talking on several different occasions. So please note that we\u2019re going to be hosting a pharmaceutical business review for analysts on Wednesday, May 20, 2015 right here in New Brunswick and then it will include a review of our overall strategy for continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline much of which I talked about today. So I look forward to seeing many of you there. Enjoy the rest of your day everybody. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 5%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 0.6%.","On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., grew by 6.5%, Asia Pacific, Africa region grew 5.3% and Europe grew 4.1%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products made strong contributions to the results in all regions. Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisition, underlying organic operational growth was 10%.","Turning now to earnings; net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.51 versus $1.33 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $449 million for after tax special items. Second quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $456 million for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.66, representing increases of 11.3% and 12.2% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represents operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the translational impact of currency. I will begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.7 billion increased 3.6% with U.S. sales down 0.5%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 5.8%. Excluding the impact of net divestitures, worldwide growth was approximately 6% with U.S. growth of approximately 5%. ","Major drivers of the results were over-the-counter products, skin care, baby care, as well as international sales of oral care and feminine protection products, partially offset by the divestiture of the North American Sanitary Protection business.","OTC sales were strong due to analgesic growth of nearly 17% worldwide and nearly 25% in the U.S., driven by market share gains as we continue to return products to the shelves. Upper respiratory products, digestive health and antismoking products also made strong contributions to the results.","Skin care results were driven by share gains for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO with new product launches supported by robust marketing campaigns, category growth, as well as an increase in trade inventory levels. Baby care results were driven by strong sales across the number of categories. International oral care results were driven by strong results for LISTERINE due to new product launches and successful marketing campaigns.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.5 billion increased 21.1% with U.S. up 36.6% and sales outside the U.S. up 6.9% driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. A major driver was our recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and EU and SOVRIAD in Japan. Excluding sales of the hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 10.5%, 15% and 6.5% respectively.","Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products; STELARA, REMICADE and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA, as well as XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA\/XEPLION, INVOKANA, PREZISTA and recently launched IMBRUVICA. Partially offsetting the growth were lower sales of ACIPHEX and CONCERTA due to generic competition and INCIVO with competitive entries.","The strong results for immunology were driven by double-digit market growth complemented by increased market share for STELARA and SIMPONI. We continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. XARELTO sales were up over 90% compared with the same quarter last year and grew over 13% on a sequential basis. Total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anti-coagulant market grew to over 13% with cardiology TRx estimated at over 23%.","The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market and estimated market growth of nearly 11.5%. ZYTIGA has captured approximately 34% of that market. Continued strong market uptick and progress on reimbursement drove the strong results outside the U.S.","ZYTIGA is approved in more than 90 countries. Increased market share drove results for INVEGA SUSTENNA\/XEPLION and PREZISTA. INVOKANA sales contributed over 2.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate and for the quarter achieved 2.3% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 1.8% in the first quarter of 2014. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 7% for the quarter, up approximately 1% sequentially.","I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment sales of $7.2 billion increased 0.9%. U.S. sales declined 1.4%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. Growth was driven by orthopedics, cardiovascular care and specialty surgery, partially offset by lower sales in diabetes care, vision care and diagnostics. Lower price primarily related to competitive bidding continue to impact the diabetes care business in the U.S., while reversal of the noted customer inventory build from the first quarter and competitive pricing dynamics impacted growth for vision care.","Excluding OCD and diabetes care, worldwide growth was approximately 2%. Orthopedic sales growth was driven by trauma and hips. Trauma was up 7% worldwide with sales outside the U.S. up 11% due to a successful tender offer as a result of our comprehensive portfolio offering. Hips growth of 5% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Knees worldwide increased 1% with the U.S. flat and 4% growth outside the U.S. Increased sales due to the successful launch of ATTUNE were partially offset by price pressures across the region and softness in the U.S. market.","Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 14% worldwide increase in our BioSense Webster business due to new catheter launches and continued market expansion. Specialty surgery results were driven by energy and bio-surgery outside the U.S. with new products driving market growth and market share. There were some notable developments in the second quarter which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. Alex, Joaquin and Paul will provide some additional commentary in their remarks.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson second quarter of 2014. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Well, thank you very much, Louise and thanks to all of you who are participating in today\u2019s call, welcome. It\u2019s a very dynamic time in the healthcare industry led most importantly by significant advancements in the care of patients and consumers. Treatment options have never been greater. Today hepatitis C and certain cancer treatments are more promising than ever and while diabetes and heart disease which we are unfortunately still seeing rates increased, they are much more manageable for the patient with oral medication that are increasingly convenient to take.","That being said, all of us in healthcare realized that there is still so much more work to do to improve the lives of patients around the world. It is encouraging to see that healthcare reform initiatives are taking hold around the world which will enable more people to see a doctor or to have procedures they needed, it may not have had the means to do so in the past. Over the past several years, we have been discussing with you how Johnson & Johnson has been taking a consistent series of steps to ensure we are best positioned to serve the needs of patients and consumers in this dynamic and rapidly evolving environment.","I would like to begin our discussion today by reviewing some of these issues. Much as we had anticipated the medical devices landscape is evolving as innovations, scale and breadth become more important to meeting the needs of the customer. At that time we noted that due to market dynamics in segments like orthopedics, the industry would likely need to consolidate, which was one factor that led to our acquisition of Synthes. In the larger device space, what the industry is now realizing is the companies like Johnson & Johnson with larger portfolios are better able to partner with hospital systems and managed care organizations to find the right balance of innovation, value and service.","And as we are all observing, there are many dynamics happening in the pharmaceutical industry as well. We noted several years ago that a focused portfolio, consistent investments in R&D and overall increased productivity in our development capabilities would be the key to driving our innovation. Since making the decision to focus our portfolio on five therapeutic areas where our expertise and the opportunity to make a significant difference aligned, our pharmaceutical business has been exceptionally productive with 14 new compounds launched since 2009, making it the fastest growing of the top 10 pharmaceutical businesses in the U.S., Europe and Japan.","These innovations and indeed the innovations that we\u2019re making in each of our segments enables us to meet the growing demand for health care products and services and creates new opportunities to address unmet medical needs. I want to now briefly review our perspective on where we see health care today. As I mentioned in January, the worldwide market is immense with an overall spend of over $8 trillion. At $2.4 trillion, products account for nearly 30% of the spend, growing at about 3% to 5% a year. ","In medical devices, we\u2019re still seeing that utilization rates in the U.S. remain depressed both in admissions and surgical procedures but we continue to believe that as the economy recovers and healthcare reform gains momentum, utilization rates will increase. In terms of prescription rates in the first half of the year, trends have modestly continued upward versus 2013 with the U.S. Rx volume increasing through May by approximately 1% over the prior year. And global growth and GDP forecast remain above 3% on stronger momentum in advanced economies such as the U.S. and Europe, while key emerging economies including Brazil and India continue to be challenged. ","Given the positive demographic trends we\u2019re seeing globally in the underlying strength of our businesses, we remain confident about the long-term growth prospects of the health care market and with our comprehensive and diverse portfolio of consumer health products, medical devices and pharmaceutical, Johnson & Johnson has a distinct competitive advantage in meeting the needs of patients.","We re-implemented the strategic framework, a very disciplined and focused approach to evolving our position as the world\u2019s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Grounded by our credo, we identified four growth drivers which by now all of you should be very familiar with, creating value through innovation, global reach, local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. We are executing against these growth drivers and capitalizing on our scale and breadth across Johnson & Johnson to ensure that we\u2019re effectively positioned to drive and sustain strong global growth over the long-term.","Now in the near-term, we also have clear priorities for the businesses including achieving our financial targets. As announced earlier today, we had record sales in the quarter of $19.5 billion which is a 9.4% operational increase as compared to the second quarter of 2013. These strong results reflect a continued success of our new product launches and progress we made in achieving our near-term priorities.","In our Medical Device and Diagnostic segment, we are leading the industry with the largest most comprehensive business in the world. And while combining businesses with overlapping products and different business models can be disruptive, our integration over the past two years of DePuy and Synthes which we mentioned earlier has gone well. Given that we\u2019re largely through it, we set a strong foundation for capturing the full growth potential we envisioned at the onset and we\u2019re pleased with the revenue and cost synergy we\u2019ve begun to realize.","And despite the market pressures, we remain optimistic about the future in this segment and are seeing strong performance in many of our MD&D businesses. In hips, we experienced strong operational growth at 5% in the quarter and continue to complement this growth with new product introductions such as the recently launched CORAIL Revision Hip System in both the United States and Europe. We also continue to see solid growth in trauma at 7% for the quarter which is built on the strength of our portfolio and the positive impact of a tender we were awarded in the Middle East as a result of our comprehensive offerings. ","In our global surgery business, we continue to see progress in many areas including consistent double-digit growth of our BioSense Webster electrophysiology portfolio. We also have a steady cadence of new product offerings exemplified by the recent FDA approval of our supplemental PMA with the SEDASYS System which we anticipate introducing into the U.S. market in the latter half of 2014 as well as the launch of the HARMONIC ACE +7 Shears with advanced hemostasis, the first purely ultrasonic device with a 7 millimeter sealing indication; it\u2019s really a great technology. ","And as you heard at our MD&D Investor Meeting in May, our strategy for sustainable long-term growth is driven by building on the strong market leadership positions we hold on the majority of our key platforms, as well as the contributions we anticipate from our recently launched products and future pipeline which includes more than 30 major filings planned by the end of 2016, many on which we have already made good progress since our presentations in May.","Finally, in-line with our emphasis to tighten the focus within our MD&D portfolio, we\u2019re creating value through divestiture opportunities and completed the divestiture of our ortho clinical diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group which Dominic will discuss in his remarks. OCD plays a very important role in health care and we\u2019re confident that it is well positioned to continue serve in the interest of patients, customers and employees.","Turning now to our consumer business, where growth is closely tied with GDP trends, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of the business and executing the strategy we outlined last summer. We have successfully exited a few business categories recently, enabling us to focus on delivering above market growth in our core business. And we anticipate greater opportunities to expand the business in the future as global economies recover and the middle-class continue to grow. ","Our consumer brands are important for the equity of Johnson & Johnson and consumer health care truly is strategic for us with the potential to serve the 2 billion additional consumers who are predicted to join the growing middle-class in emerging markets. We made significant progress in this segment over the last few years and have plans for the coming years to accelerate the growth of this business through new innovations, brand building and strategic collaborations, working off with foundation that starts with deep consumer insights. ","As part of our strategy, we have defined 11 key need states where with our expertise we can make a difference to consumers and grow our business. We are also focusing on 12 mega brands including LISTERINE, AVEENO, TYLENOL and JOHNSON\u2019s Baby to ensure they are exceeding consumers\u2019 expectations around the world and the strategy is working. We are capturing share in these and several of the other key categories. For example, we have seen strong growth in our oral care business outside the U.S. at 7% operationally. Our skin care and baby businesses are both up 7% operationally in the quarter. ","And we are also developing innovative collaboration models with retailers across the globe where we are working to create an unparalleled experience for shoppers in OTC categories like cold and flu, by sharing insights and developing ways to reduce complexity for consumers and drive visibility for our offerings. In our U.S., OTC business, we continue making good progress in restoring brands to the shelves, delivering above market growth and continue to meet each of our obligations under the consent decree. ","While we still have work to do, our goal is to ensure all of our U.S., OTC products are available every time a consumer is reaching for them. And I\u2019m confident that we are on a good path to meet that goal. Turning now to our pharmaceutical business and as results show the current business is very strong, driven by new innovative products that are clearly addressing the unmet medical needs of patients worldwide and the future is bright with the continued advancement in our pipeline. By any measure, our performance has been outstanding in this segment and we are leading the industry on numerous fronts. ","Clinical through commercial and later this morning you\u2019ll hear more from Paul and Joaquin, who I am pleased to have joining us on the call later today. ","You\u2019ll recall that in the late 2000s, our pharmaceutical business faced significant patent expirations as products worth roughly $8 billion went off patent. We have to rethink that business model and really focused on areas where we could make a difference. We needed to streamline our organization and made tough choices to gain efficiencies and reduce headcount in developed markets by nearly 25%. But through our diversified business model, with consumer and MD&D continuing to grow during this time, we were able to continue to invest in our pharma business. ","We are also continuing to invest in R&D in our five therapeutic areas at approximately 20% to 21% of sales and we have put those dollars to work with plan to file more than 10 new drugs and 25 line extensions between 2013 and 2017. Additionally, we are complementing that investment with smaller scale acquisitions and early stage licensing agreements surfaced through our innovation centers. For Johnson & Johnson, this model has been an excellent source of value creation. And I am delighted that Paul Stoffels, Joaquin Duato are joining the call today to provide an update on their tremendous work. ","A little over a year ago, we created the Johnson & Johnson Research and Development Management Committee led by Paul. This group brings together the senior most R&D leaders across Johnson & Johnson to foster cross-sector collaboration and deliver transformational new medicines and medical devices. Under Paul\u2019s excellent leadership our enterprise R&D leaders are harnessing our deep internal expertise and platform capabilities throughout the organization to develop customer focused solutions that combine our capabilities and expertise across our portfolios. ","And the commercial pharmaceutical strategies led by Joaquin, are delivering outstanding results in very competitive global markets where we\u2019re continuing to gain share and we\u2019re also securing reimbursement and access at accelerated rates. The teams they have put in place have positioned us for continued success for many years to come in our pharmaceutical sector. I am please now to turn the call over to Paul and Joaquin.","Joaquin Duato","Thank you, Alex, and good morning everyone. Paul and I are delighted to speak to you today about our continued success at our pharmaceutical group. When we look at the pharmaceuticals market, we\u2019re very optimistic about the future with an estimated 4.5% growth anticipated through 2017. While we recognized we\u2019ll continue to experience headwinds, we also see numerous positive drivers, including changing demographics and substantial unmet medical needs. ","As a result, there is significant opportunity to improve the lives of patients by bringing transformational medical innovations to the market. As Louise mentioned, we\u2019re reporting 21.1% operational growth in the second quarter of 2014. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of growth including the six consecutive quarters in double-digits. Without our hepatitis C products, our growth in the last quarter was 10.5%.","I am often asked, Joaquin, is this just a lucky run or is there something more to it. After facing significant challenges in the early 2000, we made a number of strategic changes to our business including building key development manufacturing market access and commercial competencies and focusing our innovation to produce a consistent stream of differentiated new products. These changes are directly responsible for the success we\u2019re seeing now and we believe position us to continue to succeed in the future. ","Specifically with our focus on the five strategic priorities that you see on this slide, I will speak to you about the first two of these priorities and then hand off to Paul to cover the remaining three. When we look at our commercial performance, the first thing to note is that our success is global. We are the fastest growing top 10 global pharmaceutical company in the U.S., Europe, and Japan by a significant margin.","Key to the success has been both the sales of our core growth products and the sales of new products. Regarding our core growth products, you can see that REMICADE, VELCADE, and PREZISTA all continue to deliver strong growth. 2013 REMICADE sales were 6.7 billion, which were 9% higher than 2012. In the second quarter of this year, sales grew at 8.7%. This is a product that has been in the market since 1998. VELCADE remains a backbone of multiple myeloma treatment, delivering 6.2% growth in the second quarter. ","Finally PREZISTA is the number one HIV protease inhibitor in the U.S. and Europe and we\u2019re pleased to note the recent approval in Canada of PREZCOBIX, our fixed dose combination with Gilead\u2019s cobicistat with a file for approval also in the U.S. and in Europe. We have achieved remarkable success with our new products. As you can see on the left, worldwide sales of new products launched since 2009 have already generated $5.9 billion of revenue this year and represent nearly 40% of our second quarter sales. ","In the United States alone, our cumulative sales of new products launched since 2009 is more than our next two closest competitors combined. I would now like to spend a few minutes speaking about the specific products that have driven this performance. ZYTIGA is the most successful oral oncology launch in history. It is now approved for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer in more than 90 countries. And the metastatic castration sensitive registration trial is on track. As you can see ZYTIGA continues to hold significant market share in U.S., gaining 1.2 points versus the first quarter this year. ","Worldwide, we generated second quarter sales of $562 million, representing more than 40% growth year-over-year. Nearly 60% of the sales in the quarter were outside the U.S. As for B-cell malignancies in the last year we launched our oral oncology drug IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration with Pharmacyclics with a worldwide license agreement for a 50-50 profit split. IMBRUVICA is launched in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma in patients who have received at least one prior therapy. ","Both indications are based on an overall response rate and improvement in survival or disease related symptoms has not yet been established. Moving forward, we\u2019re pursuing a global regulatory strategy for IMBRUVICA in all major markets with European MCL and CLL decisions expected later this year. IMBRUVICA has been investigated in a number of global chemical trials across potential indications.","In immunology, we are proud to note Janssen was the number one company in total U.S. sales in 2013. This was of course driven by REMICADE, which I mentioned earlier and by STELARA and SIMPONI. STELARA is the fastest growing biologic in psoriasis in major markets, including number one new-to-brand share in the U.S. This is in large part due to STELARA, key psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis approvals and because we are able to demonstrate the five year safety and efficacy of STELARA through real-world trials and registry data. For SIMPONI its ulcerative colitis indication is approved in 43 countries and I\u2019m pleased to note that the IV formulation for rheumatoid arthritis has launched in the U.S. and in Canada. Both of these products have seen robust growth this quarter more than 40% and 60% respectively.","Turning to XARELTO, we have established a highly competitive position in the U.S. with six FDA approved indications and more than 1.6 million patients treated. XARELTO is a number one novel, oral anticoagulant among U.S cardiologists. This is impart due to the fact that XARELTO has broad market access with more than 90% coverage of insured patients and the lowest co-pay of any branded novel anti-coagulant. And also because XARELTO offers a strong customer value proposition with once a day dosing convenience. As a result, we are reporting strong sales of $361 million in the second quarter, up more than 90% year-over-year. In the last quarter alone, we saw a sequential growth greater than 13%.","Another example of our innovation is INVOKANA, our SGLT2 inhibitor we launched recently in collaboration with our Diabetes Care franchise. INVOKANA is a once daily medication offering improved glycemic control, reduction in body weight and reduction in systolic blood pressure. These are all extremely important factors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. INVOKANA is approved in 45 countries and our fixed dose combination with metformin, VOKANAMET is approved in Europe. We expect the FDA decision for this fixed dose combination in the third quarter.","This year alone we have had seven major launches of INVOKANA and have received key reimbursement approvals in the U.K., Switzerland and the Netherlands. As you can see, we are number one in new-to-brand share among U.S. endocrinologist in a very competitive landscape. As Louise mentioned, INVOKANA contributed more than 2.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate.","In schizophrenia, we continue to provide medicines and solutions to improve patient care. In the U.S. we are pleased to note that the FDA granted priority review of INVEGA SUSTENNA One Month for schizoaffective disorder with a PDUFA date in November. We also recently leveraged a first of its kind real-world clinical trial with INVEGA SUSTENNA to support the filing of a sNDA. It includes data for the label demonstrating significant delayed time to relapse in schizophrenia compared to oral antipsychotics.","The chart on the right shows the strong launch performance of INVEGA SUSTENNA outperforming Abilify Maintena which in the second quarter resulted in sales of $394 million, representing a 34.4% growth year-over-year. The last example I will discuss is our recently launched hepatitis C treatment with brand names OLYSIO, GALEXOS and SOVRIAD. We continue to see significant market potential in the hepatitis C area and estimate nearly 97% of the infected population in G7 countries remains untreated.","As you are aware interferon free treatment options represent a significant advance for patients. OLYSIO is approved for the use in interferon free treatment in combination with other medicinal products in Europe in genotype 1 or 4 patients who are interferon ineligible or intolerant. In the U.S. the FDA granted priority review of our sNDA based on the COSMOS trial data for the use of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir, currently marketed at Sovaldi by Gilead with a PDUFA date of November the 6.","In-line with the AASLD and IDSA guidelines, we have seen very strong adoption in the first half of this year with second quarter sales totaling $831 million. Moving forward we recognize there will be increased competitive activity with the entrance of new interferon treatment options beginning later this year and thus we expect the current run rate is unlikely to continue into 2015. We are planning studies to evaluate simeprevir with other agents to offer physicians and patients increased flexibility. ","Turning now to emerging markets, our strategy is focused on a strong innovative brand growth through targeted capability building and novel access models. In particular, we are harnessing innovation. One example of this is the opening of our Shanghai Innovation Center expected in October this year. We\u2019re also improving local manufacturing capacity by building factories such as our state-of-the-art facility in Xi'an, China and through technology transfer to local organizations. ","Finally, we\u2019re pioneering new business models through public-private partnerships, leveraging the strength of our Johnson & Johnson organization to improve access to our medicines. As you can see, we have had remarkable global success. This success is the direct result of a strategic choices and changes that we made to our business years ago. Going forward, we\u2019re focused on two critical success factors to maintain our momentum. First, we will continue to leverage our world class capabilities in clinical development, regulatory manufacturing, market access and commercial, to promote the ongoing success of our new products. ","In total, six of these products have each sold more than $ 1 billion in the last four quarters and two more are on track to reach this threshold. As you saw on the previous slide, several have robust growth rates of 40%, 60% and even 90%. Second, we are deeply committed to sustaining long-term growth and Paul will now tell you more about how our total emphasis on innovation has built a strong pipeline of transformational products that we believe will catalyze the next wave of growth for our business. Paul?","Paul Stoffels","Thank you Joaquin and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure today to discuss with you our pharmaceutical R&D strategy which is focused on delivering transformational medical innovation and create the cycle of success that positions us for continued growth in the future. Our vision to enter R&D strategy has not changed. As a leading healthcare company, we believe that by focusing on transformational innovation, medical need and differentiation, we can make a significant difference in the world and build a sustainable growing business. ","We have some of the world\u2019s leading scientific and medical experts who bring deep insights to select and prioritize the best science, internal or external, to tackle those diseases. We have established unparalleled global development capabilities and have set industry benchmark for timelines for filing submissions and productivity and also for speed to market. We launched 14 new products in the past five years in major markets around the world, including three new molecular entities or NMEs that we launched since our pharmaceutical\u2019s update in May last year; OLYSIO, IMBRUVICA and SYLVANT, that strategy is delivering. ","In the last update at a Pharmaceutical Analyst Day last May, we told you that we anticipated to filing more than 10 potential NMEs and more than 25 significant line extensions between 2013 and 2017. We are on track to deliver. Since last May, in addition to launching three new products, we have received 20 additional approvals for line extensions in major markets. The significant line extensions approved are SIMPONI for ulcerative colitis, SIMPONI ARIA for rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S., IMBRUVICA for previously treated CLL, VELCADE for multiple myeloma retreatment combination therapy and transplant, OLYSIO for treatment of experienced patients, STELARA for psoriatic arthritis and VOKANAME fixed dose combination with metformin immediately release formulation for type 2 diabetes in Europe. ","Our winning formula has been consistent. First, we believe in focus. We focused on the few key disease areas where we can really make a difference and we prioritize our investments in those areas. The disease area focus has allowed us to attract the world\u2019s leading scientists and medical experts and build a great depth of expertise in those areas. Second, our experts select and source the best science and technology through our own internal research or by accessing the best science externally through partnerships, collaborations, licensing and acquisitions. ","Third, we leverage the present scale of our global development organization. Our global capabilities have allowed us to simultaneously develop, file and launch drugs across the globe with industry-leading efficiency, quality and success rates. And finally, one of our key success factors has been our ability to accelerate cycle times and achieve industry-leading timelines for regulatory submissions. I will focus on each of these success factors next.","Our focus on innovation is a critical aspect of the strategy. We focus our research in five therapeutic areas and within those areas we focus on specific disease areas where there is a high unmet need, where there is transformational science that we can leverage and where we have deep expertise and capabilities that we can bring to bear. Today, we\u2019re focused on 18 disease areas and in each of these areas we have leading expertise and know-how to select the best science thereby increasing the probability of success. We have also entered into the exciting area of immuno-oncology where there is promising new signs and has established several collaborations. ","This slide shows our entire end-to-end strategy on one page. Build a rigorous approach to sourcing innovation, to global development, and the key characteristics of a strategy that sets us apart. In addition to the deep internal expertise within our therapeutic areas, we have strong research capabilities in biomarkers and world-class capabilities in our centers of excellence in small molecules, bio-technology, vaccines and diagnostics. We complement this with external innovation. We access early innovation to our J&J innovation centers in London, Boston, San Francisco and Shanghai. Today we have over 100 projects in discovery and about 50 NMEs in early development.","In addition, we have more than 300 collaborations externally and over 50 companies located in our incubator. To access innovation in the early development stage, we leverage venture capital to invest in exciting growth opportunities, explore new areas and accelerate assets. In late-stage, we access innovation via traditional licensing, partnerships and acquisition example of which include our recent deals with Genmab on multiple myeloma, with Aragon on prostate cancer, with ViiV Healthcare on HIV and with Vertex on influenza A.","As I mentioned, we have world-class global development capabilities. We have built strong medical and scientific teams with disease area, clinical and regulatory expertise. We are increasing the value of our R&D portfolio by optimizing outputs, time, cost and quality. Our 24x7 development operations, speed-to-market and global execution make us a partner of choice in the industry.","These capabilities along with our market access and launch excellence, represent some of our key strengths and differentiators. They have enabled us to simultaneously file and launch our products globally, generate compelling value evidence and deliver successful launches of our products in multiple markets. And the flexibility and commercialization models with partners and our ability to collaborate and leverage our strength and capabilities, enable us to achieve industry-leading success and growth. A deep understanding of the innovation landscape is key to our ability to source innovation. ","Our experts define an innovation strategy, conduct a holistic scan of the innovation landscape and prioritize all accessible opportunities, internal or external to select the best assets. Here you see a bulls eye chart of the innovation landscape for B-cell malignancy. The inner circles represent later stage products and the outer circles the early stage preclinical products. We take this rigorous approach to evaluating and sourcing innovation in each of the disease areas.","Our development organization continues to deliver. We have a flexible R&D operations engine which can pivot from execution of mega trials to execution of trials for rare diseases and today is supporting about 75,000 patients across 400 clinical studies annually. These capabilities have accelerated our speeds to market. They have enabled a successful execution of notable comprehensive and large clinical programs which are outcomes-based and use adaptive study designs. We have round the world, round the clock capabilities in all aspects of the clinical development and a critical path culture that enables the speed while maintaining quality.","Our fourth critical success factor has been our ability to accelerate cycle time. Because of our focus on medical need and differentiation, of the last 10 new NMEs we launched, five received priority review status. In addition, we received breakthrough designation for five indications with three of our products. Today, average cycle time from database to submission is about two months better than industry median making us the leader in time to submission. These capabilities have enabled us to have industry-leading NME success rate with fastest cycle times. Compared to our competitors, we have a higher development success rate resulting in more NME approvals per year.","Looking to the future, we have an exciting pipeline. On the left you see the three NME approvals since May 2013 and the number of significant line extensions approved since last May. In the middle you can see some of our key NMEs which are under clinical investigation as potential treatment for key unmet needs in a variety of areas.","Daratumumab, the first anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, a compound with breakthrough status which we licensed from Genmab; ARN-509, an androgen receptor inhibitor for pre-metastatic prostate cancer which came to us from the acquisition of Aragon; FGFR kinase inhibitors for solid tumors discovered in a collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals; Sirukumab, the first anti-IL-6 therapy for patients with RA and other autoimmune diseases; Guselkumab, the first anti-IL-23 antibody for psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune diseases; Fulranumab, an anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritic pain licensed from Amgen; and Esketamine, the first NMDA antagonist for patients with treatment-resistant depression also with breakthrough designation.","And VX-787, a first-in-class influenza A specific oral polymerase inhibitor, a compound we recently licensed from Vertex. We also have a number of key line extensions in development including for key products such as XARELTO and INVOKANA. We have Paliperidone","Palmitate three-month formulation, the first three-month long-acting injectable treatment for patients with schizophrenia. And ibrutinib the first BTK inhibitor oncology drug for the treatment of several B-cell malignancies. ","Our people are driven by a sense of purpose to care for the world. At times we develop a product just because it is a right thing to do. We have the privilege to serve in health care and we also have a responsibility. One example of this is SIRTURO the first therapy with novel mechanism of action against TB approved by the FDA in more than 40 years. SIRTURO is now approved in U.S., Europe, Russia and Korea and the file is under review in seven other countries.","We have established multiple product development partnerships and through our agreement with the Global Drug Facility, we are making SIRTURO available to critically ill patients in 130 countries. We also established a collaboration with the International Partnership for Microbicides for the development of TMC120 for prevention of transmission of HIV, which is now in large scale clinical testing. We are providing access to products by not enforcing patents on PREZISTA in Sub-Saharan Africa and least developed countries and by licensing of HIV products to generic producers. And finally to a vaccine unit, we also make critical vaccines available to children around the world and we\u2019re developing new vaccines for polio and HIV.","In summary, we are in an extraordinary cycle of success. We have world-class commercial capabilities driving our growth. Our accelerated emerging market performance is sustaining a momentum. Our focus on innovation, medical need and differentiation sets us up to deliver future growth. We have a leading R&D pipeline with differentiated therapies addressing major unmet needs in significant markets. Our innovation is delivering growth and our growth is sustaining our ability to invest in innovation. We believe our business is well positioned to succeed for the long-term. Thank you and now, let me turn it back to Alex.","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Paul and Joaquin. I hope you can see why we\u2019re also proud of the Pharmaceutical segment and very optimistic about our future growth in this area. So, I would now like to turn it over to Dominic Caruso for more detailed review of our financial performance.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks, Alex, and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve heard on the call, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress and strong results thus far in 2014 and we\u2019re well positioned for continued growth in this dynamic health care environment. I\u2019ll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the second quarter as well as the recently completed OCD divestiture. I will then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of the year.","Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2014. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. We are pleased to report adjusted net earnings of $4.8 billion in the quarter which was up 11.3% over the second quarter of 2013. And adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.48 a year ago, up 12.2%, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call.","These results were driven by strong operational sales growth of 9%, primarily from our recently launched pharmaceutical products including hepatitis C treatment OLYSIO or SOVRIAD which is the brand name in Japan. The net impact of our hepatitis C products including OLYSIO, SOVRIAD and INCIVO contributed approximately 4% to the worldwide operational sales growth. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude certain charges for the following special items. Cost associated with the continued integration of Synthes and additional reserves for litigation expenses.","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I am pleased to point out that we saw a very good operating performance this quarter. Overall, our pretax operating margin increased 230 basis points and a major driver of that increase came from sales of OLYSIO. Cost of goods sold was 30 basis points higher than a same period last year, primarily due to pricing dynamics and the impact of the devaluation of the Japanese yen partly offset by positive mix of the business. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 200 basis points lower as compared with the second quarter of 2013, due to the growth of new products in our pharmaceutical business and overall good management of cost primarily in our MD&D business.","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was down compared with the prior year, primarily due to timing of various R&D programs, as we expect to continue to make important investments for the future. Interest expense net of interest income of approximately $100 million was slightly higher than prior year. Other expenses net of other income was $226 million in the quarter compared to $172 million in the same period of last year. Now excluding the special items that were included in this line item, other expenses net of other income was actually a net gain of $194 million compared to a net gain of $394 million as prior year reflected the gain we recognized on the sale of our shares in Elan Corporation.","This year, the net gain reflects the divestiture of our K-Y brand partly offset by some asset write-downs. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.1% compared to 20% in the same period last year, due primarily to geographic mix of the results in each period. Early in the third quarter, we completed the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics to the Carlyle Group for approximately $4 billion subject to customary adjustments. ","On an after-tax basis and we will record a net gain of approximately $1 billion which we will treat as a special item in the third quarter results. Since we will no longer recognize sales or earnings from this business going forward, we plan to buy back shares with the cash proceeds to mitigate the EPS impact on future earnings. Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2014. Before we discuss sales and earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast; beginning with cash and interest income and expense. ","At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $14.5 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $31.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $17.1 billion of debt. For purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million which is consistent with our previous guidance.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2014 reflecting other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $450 million to $550 million, which is lower than our previous guidance.","And now a word on taxes; our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by congress, although that has not yet occurred. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014 excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5%. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year.","Now turning to guidance on sales and earnings. As we have done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in April. For sales, our assumptions remains consistent from earlier guidance that PROCRIT will not have biosimilar competition in 2014 and for INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not anticipate generic entries for these products this year.","Further, our guidance now reflects the divestitures of OCD and the net incremental sales of our hepatitis C products. Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis between 4.5% and 5.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014, again on a constant currency basis, for approximately $74.5 billion to $75.3 billion which is lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the net impact of the adjustment for the divestiture of OCD and incremental hepatitis C product sales.","Our underlying operational growth in 2014 guidance excluding the hepatitis C products and OCD for the full year is approximately 4%. As you know we are anticipating that OLYSIO will face significant competition from new hepatitis C products later in the year, the full impact of which is difficult for us to predict at this point. And while we\u2019re not providing guidance for 2015, this will certainly pose a headwind next year. ","We\u2019re also not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 0.5%; plus under this scenario we would expect reported sales growth to range between 4% and 5% for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $74.1 billion to $74.9 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance, again now adjusted for OCD and hepatitis C products as noted earlier.","Moving on to earnings; there are factors to note about foreign currency fluctuations that impact real economic transactions as opposed to only translation. As we have discussed in the past, the devaluation of the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. Dollar is expected to have a negative impact on 2014 gross margins of approximately 60 basis points or negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.11. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact of an official devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar or any other currency. ","Our 2014 guidance reflects the strong performance we saw in the second quarter. The second half impact of the divestiture of OCD, a lower level of net gains at other income and expenses and our plan to continue investing in future growth. Given those factors, we suggest that you consider full year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items of between $5.80 and $5.87 per share on an operational or constant currency basis. ","","Again while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS of currency exchange rates would have remained where they were as of last week for the balance of the year then our reported EPS excluding special items would be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share due to exchange rate fluctuations. We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS excluding special items in the range between $5.85 and $5.92 per share or a growth rate of 6% to 7%; this is higher than our previous guidance. And as a reminder, our earnings include intangible amortization of $1.4 billion on a before tax basis or an impact of approximately $0.38 on EPS.","As you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating margins will show a stronger improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels than we previously expected. This is due to the strong performance of our business primarily driven by new product launches including the significant benefit from OLYSIO this year.","In summary, we are very pleased with our strong results through the midpoint. Our strong performance in the second quarter has allowed us to offset the negative earnings impact that will occur in the second half of this year from the recently completed divestiture of the OCD business. Although we expect to see lower other income and expense gains and along with our intent to invest in future growth, we are very comfortable with an overall increase in our earnings guidance.","And now I\u2019d like to turn things back over to Louise for that Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. Jennifer, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Good morning. Quickly for Alex and then also for Joaquin or Paul. Alex I\u2019m going straight from M&A for you, but for big picture I just might kind of your view on GDP growth in developed markets. It sounds like in Medtech we\u2019re seeing a bit of a disconnect maybe in consumer as well, it is a growing to your GDP, we\u2019ll be improving. What's your view in the near-term and long-term that the correlation may improve or get better as you look at your forecast?","Alex Gorsky","Yes. Matt, this is Alex. Thanks a lot for the question. As you know trying to predict these things out of the future is always a bit of a challenge. But as we\u2019re experiencing right now and as we discussed earlier in the discussion, we\u2019re seeing hospital utilization rates specifically admission, surgical procedures, lab procedures and even primary care physician visits, they remained somewhat subdued. And we\u2019ve seen this trend for several quarters now. Long-term of course we see the offset to that in demographics, increasing middle class increasing access to care under the Affordable Care Act as drivers for us. So we remained optimistic because we don\u2019t think that there is a fundamental reason for the underlying demand or disease rights to change, but that's not something that we\u2019re certainly watching.","If we look across to Europe, we continue to see some challenge in areas. But overall, we would say that the impact in Europe has moderated somewhat and we continue to see good solid growth in the developing markets. I mean overall we had about 10% growth on an annual basis so far in BRIC and we expect that to continue into the future as well. So, I mean I think that's the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now. But it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re going to continue to watch closely.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Thanks Alex. And a quick one for Paul or Joaquin, you gave us a lot of data on the pharma, the pipeline in the near-term, can you just say broadly on the R&D because you\u2019re still spending a lot of money as a percent of sales even though the overall pharma growth has accelerated. Can you say of the five therapeutic areas is oncology and immunology getting the lion\u2019s share of that in the current run rate?","Paul Stoffels","Yes absolutely. Especially oncology is getting the lion share of that, we have several new director oncology therapeutics; Daratumumab, ARN-509, ibrutinib with all of the line extensions, as well as now immuno-oncology where we have several collaborations and a lot of internal research ongoing, as well as efforts in biomarkers in establishing diagnostic biomarkers approach to get to a much better patient outcome. So that is definitely the largest. As well as immunology where we still continue to focus on several new products; Guselkumab and we have also there a number of new oral therapies in development. So, those two continue to be the focus of the organization with significant resources.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Thanks Paul.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Dominic, I just want to start with the quarter and with the guidance revision I think one of the questions people have is why didn\u2019t J&J raise guidance by more than they do at this point. So I wonder maybe we could spend a minute on that, but the quarter itself was $0.11 above this rate consensus you raised by $0.05 in the low-end, $0.02 in the high-end and you\u2019re observing $0.05 of dilution from OCD, it looks like each of them, the other income gain assumed for the year by the $0.04, anything else that I am missing there and maybe just want to comment on the decision to raise guidance which you did?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, sure Mike, thanks. Just a couple of points, I mean we did of course exceed street estimates for the quarter by $0.11. As you know, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, we provide annual guidance, and when we spoke to the investment community last quarter we were confident that our strong operating results would help absorb the OCD dilution in the back half of the year within the range we have previously provided. So let me just walk down the items that you\u2019ve mentioned. We did exceed analyst estimates by about $0.11. Almost half of that will be used of course to offset the OCD lower earnings in the back half of the year. As you pointed out, other income and expense gains will be lower than we expected this year. That\u2019s another $0.03 or $ 0.04. Currency was a minor adjustment. If you look at our overall guidance, we therefore after absorbing this $0.11 that we just described, we do think that overall guidance is up about four pennies. If we think about the midpoint of our guidance, last time it was about 585 the mid-point now it is about 589. So we feel good that despite this reconciliation that you just walked through, the business will continue to perform well and therefore we are comfortable raising the guidance for the balance of the year.","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Okay, and let me ask one product question if I can and the reason, during the quarter there was a new patent issue for ZYTIGA, that I was hoping you could just comment on your current expectations where generic competition for ZYTIGA industry historically assume that would come in late 2016. Can you update us or your thoughts on that topic?","Joaquin Duato","Thank you. This is Joaquin. You are correct. Our expectation is that ZYTIGA patent will go until December 16, that is the composition of matter with a five-year data exclusivity under Hatch-Waxman extension.","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan"," ","And Joaquin the notice of allowance on the three-four patent; does that seem like taking it all in terms of timing?","Joaquin Duato","Not at this point. We are now working and understanding what the impact of this notice of allowance is. As a matter of patent use, so at this point we remain -- we have our position that I described before.","Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan","Thanks Joaquin.","Louise Mehrotra ","Thank you, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Just first, just starting the quarter, Dominic, I was wondering if you could call out, or help us think through a little bit about the margin contribution of OLYSIO and impact of the Japanese Yen, so we can get a better sense for kind of what the underlying operating margin of the business might being moving forward excluding kind of those items.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Derrick. Well, overall, including the negative impact of the Japanese Yen to gross margins which was said was about 60 basis points for the year. Obviously, we saw most of that in the second quarter. The overall pre-tax operating margin improved about 230 basis points despite that headwind. And I would say about two thirds of that improvement is attributable to OLYSIO. That\u2019s how we frame it.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, and that\u2019s something that -- when we think about sort of next year moving forward, how much of that should we think about perhaps not being sustainable?","Dominic Caruso","Well, I would say, it\u2019s a little -- as I mentioned earlier, Derrick, it\u2019s a little too early to predict. I mean, we know that new competition is coming, but at this point it\u2019s premature to speculate on it. Obviously, when we speak to you in January about our guidance for \u201915, we\u2019ll make that much clear then.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks. And then a specific pharma product question. I was wondering if you could comment on the impact of biosimilar competition to REMICADE. So next year in the European markets, the major European market, should start seeing some biosimilar competition. What are your expectations there? Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you were seeing in these few markets where you are already seeing that biosimilar entrant? And then in the U.S., one of the competitors has talked about filing for a biosimilar REMICADE before the end of this year with potential FDA approval for next year. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how secure you feel about your IP position in the U.S. for REMICADE?","Joaquin Duato","Thanks for the question. And the biosimilars area is something that we watch very closely. As you know, biosimilars are not identical to their innate or medicines and therefore the contingency in which they will prescribe will be different than the situation we have in a small molecule. At the same time, developing and manufacturing and commercializing biosimilars has different costs. I mean they need to prepare a full clinical dossier and manufacturing biologics is an expensive and complex process. And commercializing them will have also additional cost.","So we expect biosimilars to behave as lower cost brands. And from that perspective, biosimilars wouldn\u2019t have the type of impacting erosion that you see with generic and small molecules. A good example of that is what happened with Epoetin Alfa in Europe. We lost the patent years ago and we remained a leading Epoetin Alfa product in Europe despite of the biosimilar that had been launched, now what is our part in landscape today, you refer to the U.S. in our two key markets in the U.S., our patent would expire in September 18 and in our key European as present 80% of European sales in February 15. Our strategy regarding biosimilar remained the same. We are going to clearly work with the regulatory authorities to ensure patient safety in this area as far as the conditions in which these products have to be developed and have to be prescribed that include naming, which we think it\u2019s important, that includes to what extent indications should not be extrapolated and that includes also obviously interchangeability, so that\u2019s the first point that we\u2019re working globally in order to ensure patient safety.","The second point is that we have an extensive safety real-world evidence database with regards to REMICADE, it\u2019s been used already prescribing 2 million patients, it was launched in 1998 and we believe that is a factor that this is we consider when they prescribe. And the third one is that we continue to invest in immunology as Paul described, we think there is a still unmet medical needs there and we\u2019re going to work in different mechanic or fractions such anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-23 in order to try to address these unmet medical needs.","So that\u2019s our strategy and now impact so far of biosimilars in the countries that have been launched like Korea or some European countries in which we are not patent protected. The impact has been very-very limited and the price erosion has also been limited. The discount in which these products have been launched averaged about 25% to the branded price, so that\u2019s the situation today as far as the biosimilar to REMICADE. With regard to your question of the U.S. and the patent of REMICADE in the U.S., we feel very strong about the strength of patents and we continue confirm that our patent as we see today will expire in September 18.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Two for Alex, so Alex, this is one of the best quarters you posted in many-many years I think. I doubt 10% organic growth and 12% EPS growth is the sustainable long term, so what are your financial goals for J&J long term? And how should investors think about kind of what\u2019s realistic for J&J over the next few years? And I did have one follow-up for you Alex.","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Larry. Thanks a lot for the question. As we articulated back in January, we see that longer term the overall healthcare market growing somewhere in the rate of 3% to 5% and we definitely try to manage for the long-term, and so while quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year we may see some fluctuations. We think generally speaking as we put in all the ups and downs going forward that\u2019s probably a pretty reasonable estimate in consistent with what a lot of surveys would show. Our goal is that we want to always exceed the market growth i.e., we want to be bringing new innovations to market, we want to be competitive in the way we gain share.","So we always aspire and shoot to exceed what the market growth is, and we said in terms of our overall profitability and bottom line performance that a company of our size and our of our scale should consistently strive to grow our bottom line at or slightly faster than our top. So that\u2019s really our long term strategy, but as you\u2019ve acknowledged at the beginning of the question, we\u2019re very proud the performance that we\u2019re posting as of now. And certainly it\u2019s led by our pharmaceutical group that really by any measure has done exceedingly well starting by bringing a lot of great new therapies that were helping patients, but also driving our business.","But I also think if you look across the balance of business, our consumer as we noted while up 3.5 operationally, if we netted out for divestitures growing at almost 6%, and if you look at the strength of some of underlying brands skin care, baby care, North America OTCs, all very solid high single digits taking share across the boards that we\u2019re pleased with that. And even in our MD&D while clearly we a few areas that had been challenged such as the pricing in the diabetes market, the OCD divestiture, and some investments we\u2019re making in other areas we think if we net out for divestitures in some of those extremes, we\u2019re probably up at about 2% with clearly a path to growth faster going forward. So that\u2019s the way we see it over all Larry.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s very helpful and into good segway into my follow-up, so you\u2019ve talked about consolidation, the need for consolidation in the med-tech industry earlier in your remarks, so can you talk about the implications of the Medtronic-Covidien merger for the industry J&J and how do you use the J&J MD&D business evolving over the next few years? Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","Sure, and thank you. Larry, as you think back to about three years ago when we announced the Synthes acquisition I think 2.5 to 3 years, part of the strategy rationale that we made at that time was that we, we definitely saw consolidation in the future simply because of the number of different participants you had in the market. The pressures that we expected going forward and as a result of that we believe proactively sought out and conducted the Synthes acquisition, which we\u2019re pleased with the way that it\u2019s going, and we have achieved our sales as well as our margin, goals that we have set for ourselves along the way and in fact I think, after the last couple of years of going through disruption which you would anticipate in a merger of that size, I think now we\u2019re really poised for solid growth going forward. ","And so, what I would say is at that time we had predicted to that in fact it would happen, I think the other aspect, of course, we looked at areas like our cardiovascular business and drug alluding stands. And we saw a lot of market pressure ahead both in terms of volume and pricing. We therefore made a difficult decision to access that market, but nonetheless we think that that was the right decision to make base upon the overall dynamics. ","So, if we look at ourselves today, we think we\u2019re clearly the broadest medical device company. We think we\u2019re well positioned, particularly when you consider areas like general surgery, like orthopedics we have not only brought, but also deep offerings that gives us solid market positions across the number of different platforms. We realized that in cardiovascular we\u2019re subscale, we have a very strong EP business that\u2019s growing at 14% we also estimate innovations but by continuing frankly to monitor and watch that market as we see what happens in some of those segments. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad place to be. And certainly we\u2019ll continue to evaluate our options going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from line Matt Miksic, Piper Jaffray.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. One for you Alex, just on your conversation around emerging markets; I appreciate all the additional color and the update. I was curious given the traditional strategies for penetrating this market and I\u2019d say over the last several years are you still evolving whether it\u2019s promotion and penetration with diagnostic for commercializing prior generation or lower costs. Therapeutic that might fit better to these markets. The local innovation approach or what sales team like comes if (ph) -- like a customization approach as you look at some of these emerging middle markets, I\u2019d love to understand a little bit more about how that\u2019s going and maybe when we\u2019ll start to see some of the fruit of those efforts? And then I have one follow-up.","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Matt, look as you know what I think that there been several phases to growth in emerging markets and I think historically we have taken a lot of our technology from the developed markets and we\u2019ve basically appealed to the higher segments in the emerging markets. And obviously try to adapt those products based upon the commercial model, the distribution system that exists in that particular area. But more and more we\u2019ve realized that our approach is and sometimes actually the unmet medical need is different and so developing the underlying capability or product acquisition, developments and commercialization unique to that entity is something that we\u2019re focusing on. So that\u2019s a major driver behind our innovation center that we focused in Shanghai. We do have R&D centers in both Shanghai and Beijing. I think we\u2019re still in the earlier phases of some of the projects that we have coming out of those, but clearly it\u2019s our goal to develop a much more customized approach for those particular markets. That being said, we still think that there is good opportunity in some of the premium segments across all three of our sectors. So we\u2019ll continue to work those very hard as well.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Great, and then as it may be a little off script here but either its Louise or Dominic, I'd love to understand one of the comments you mentioned on your orthopedic market and your knee business, pricing pressure I think you mentioned in the market softness. Given that you had introduced the rotating platform version of Atune this spring and it seemed like that\u2019s the business that should be firing on at least most cylinders. Can you give us any more colors as to why it came up flat and what we can expect going forward?","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Matt, this is Alex again. Let me take a shot at that first and then Louise can certainly add any colors necessary. But as you know we\u2019re one of the first companies to report in this space. So it\u2019s always a challenge to predict exactly how everyone is going to come in, but as we look at our business we think that we\u2019re maintaining share or slightly growing, what we\u2019ve seen is somewhat of a more cyclical trend towards particular knee procedures, we think shifting more to the back end of the year. And if you think about last year and a very robust growth that we saw in Q4 about some of the ways now the patients have a greater responsibility providing their co-payments upfront with the procedures, but that does result in more of a second half of the year affect than early in the year. Again, let me put the caveat in but we can\u2019t say that was certainly, because we\u2019re coming out early on the reporting, we\u2019re going to watch it closely but from what we\u2019re hearing from our people in the field. We don\u2019t think that there is significant share shifts taking place. We continue to get really good feedback on the Atune as it continues to be rolled out. And as you can see from the performance of our hips up 5%, trauma up 7%, you know the core of our business and our teams, we believe are performing well. So that\u2019s our position at this point in time.","Louise Mehrotra","I think you covered it very well. Next question please.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Co.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just first for Dominic, you commented two thirds of the 230 basis points of margin expansion a quarter was contributed by OLYSIO, it means about 75 basis points to 80 basis points from the rest of the business. But can you just comment on relative contributions from the pharma medical device unit and consumer units was each a contributor? And then how should we think about our operating margins for the device unit excluding Ortho-Clinical, how much improvement can we expect post divesture going forward?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, sure Josh. Well obviously the pharmaceutical business that drove most of our growth this quarter is our best performing business in margin, so obviously they are major contributor. The other two businesses also contributed, I mentioned the lower cost in the MD&D business in particular. I think going forward, it\u2019s difficult to predict for each business because as we develop our plans, we will balance off investment opportunities for each business with appropriate, whether the R&D programs or product launches et cetera. So I can\u2019t give you a specific as to what to expect from each for the business going forward. But for MD&D, the margins ex-OCD should definitely improve, because that was a business that had margins lower than our overall MD&D business.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.","Great, thanks. And Louise, sorry if I missed this, but did you comp the growth of the spine unit and then can you download us on pricing mix for spine in the quarter?","Louise Mehrotra","Okay, so the spine unit in the U.S. this is operational growth. In the U.S., it is down 2%, O-U.S. it is up 4% for a worldwide growth up 1% for the total. And in terms of pricing in spine, spine in terms of price in the U.S. only, I don\u2019t have it for the worldwide. The U.S. is down 5% in price with a positive mix of about 1.44% and net for about 3.5% down. Okay, next question please.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel","From a point of optimization, you obviously have made a lot of moves here with acquisitions since you took over acquisitions and divestitures. And I assume you\u2019re going to continue to optimize and refine the portfolio but is there a lot more to come, are you down to a near term, how should we be thinking about it?","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Rick thanks a lot for the question. Rick, we\u2019re going to continue to stay very active, particularly where we see great areas of unmet medical need where we think we can contribute and really bring value to the marketplace. I think there are opportunities across all of our segments. We\u2019ve been active as Paul noted earlier in some of the partnerships, in development programs that we\u2019ve been able to bring together in our pharmaceutical group. And we think if there, our agnostic approach of internal versus external sourcing is actually really have been a driver. At the end of the day, we went at that science and I think clearly we are seeing the results of that approach with the success that we\u2019re experiencing. But we are certainly not slowing down, we continue to be very active particularly in the five therapeutic areas where we are targeting. ","I think if you look across MD&D, there too, we continue to see opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, given our decision several years ago in cardiovascular, we\u2019re going to continue to watch that area very close to augment potentially onto our EEP business, which has done very well. ","And we continue to look for other ways in orthopedics as well as in global surgery. Again, where we see great technology that\u2019s either a complimentary fit, has platform potential or may give us an opportunity for vertical integration. And in our consumer segment, another area that we\u2019re very committed to, here too, we see opportunities. We think that we\u2019ve done a very nice job over the past several years of focusing on really what are the key growth opportunities that we have in that segment, and as a result, we\u2019ve done several smaller divestures. We think that\u2019s allowed us to be more focused, more effective, more efficient. But here too, we certainly see opportunities to gain additional scale across different areas of that portfolio. So we\u2019ll remain active, but I think in a strategic level, that\u2019s the way that we are currently thinking about it.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Thank you for that. Just a follow-up question on diabetes. Diabetes particularly in U.S. remains challenged, but it was a little less challenged this quarter expected. Are we close to a turning point, when do you think that we get back to even if you will on that and maybe can you follow-up with a little discussion about the vibe rollout, when will we see the full O-U.S. launch and where are you in the U.S. with filings and launch? Thank you very much.","Alex Gorsky","Yes, a couple of things. One is, we remain committed to the diabetes space and I think as you know, the significant I think it was 72% price reduction took place in the United States occurred in the first half of the year, so we do expect to be lapping that. If we look at the underlying dynamics of the market, I\u2019d like to commend our team because we continue to see very good performance in SMDG both in the U.S. as well as outside. Also with our insulin pump business, Animas, we\u2019ve seen proving performance. We do have Viario under review by the FDA, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re projecting an approval time at this point, but we certainly think that that's going to offer a nice addition for patients as well as for physicians. And the other important dynamic, Rick is that our diabetes business has also been involved in launch of INVOKANA. And when you consider the strong relationships that we\u2019ve had for a number of years with the endocrinologists, part of our early success with INVOKANA has been because of the way we\u2019ve been able to bring a broader more comprehensive offering to those specialists and frankly that's better for patients that's better for the physicians and better for our business.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Two questions; one, how should we be thinking about OLYSIO trends in 2015, it looks like OLYSIO probably this year is going to sum around $2 billion. Should we think next year closer to $1 billion, I know you\u2019re talking about a decline I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how we should model the decline for 2015 that's my first question.","And then second, SG&A came in as a ratio well below our expectations, I\u2019m sorry, way better than our expectations. We\u2019re thinking SG&A ratio somewhere in the 29% to 30% in the quarter it came in at 28%. I don\u2019t think that's a realistic run rate, so maybe help us think about SG&A spend for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, Glenn. Let me comment a little bit on OLYSIO then ask Joaquin to comment as well. Obviously you saw an uptick in OLYSIO sales in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. We had $800 million in the second quarter. And we noted that we expect competition coming soon at the latter part of the year. So obviously for the second half of the year, we will have competition for OLYSIO that we did not have in the first two quarters. So in terms of modeling, we do expect that the current run rate is not really a sustainable run rate going forward. Joaquin anything else to add to that?","Joaquin Duato","Not really to what you mentioned was big competition coming in and different fee regiments coming into the market in the later part of this year. So it sounds like that the current run rate is going to continue. That said we see OLYSIO a very relevant player in hepatitis C moving forward too. And we continue to invest in different clinical trials and clinical data to prove additional flexibility for patients and physicians.","Paul described before that the study that we are doing in Phase III with 12 and 8 weeks in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients in combination with sofosbuvir and we plan to continue to do different studies with different treatment regiments to add additional flexibility. Paul?","Paul Stoffels","The focus on shortening therapy, as well as increasing Q rates for patients by using multiple different combinations and we are investing significantly in next stage studies.","Dominic Caruso","Hey Glenn, just to follow-up on your question about SG&A, we don\u2019t give line specific guidance, but it is true that this particular quarter we saw 200 basis point improvement in SG&A compared to last year. And most of the 230 basis point improvement in pre-tax operating margin was a result of that. And I mentioned earlier that that was also two-thirds driven by OLYSIO.","So I think this quarter is a relative low SG&A quarter relatively speaking, but it is an area that we constantly strive to keep an eye on because quite frankly we\u2019d rather invest more in R&D. So if we can spend more in R&D and get more productive R&D investment, we would look to offset that with some lower SG&A spend going forward.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Thanks for taking my question. I have some pharma-directed questions taking advantage of Paul and Joaquin\u2019s presence. I know you guys talk about your commercial execution and I know you spend a lot of money modeling complex markets like the prostate market. Could you just comment briefly with regards to any particular hurdles you anticipate with Aragon 509 as it may be difficult to show mortality benefit in a short trial? And secondly how bigger that market be if you the combined prostate market when you are able to penetrate in the prostate, the pre-metastatic, but high risk category? That's my first question. Thanks.","Joaquin Duato","So let me start with the size of the market and may be a good example is how ZYTIGA is doing today. About 60% of the ZYTIGA sales today are already in the pre-chemotherapy setting. Now how big the non-metastatic setting is going to be because as you know we started the trial with ARN-509 in patients with high rising PSAs and noted metastatic is going to be bigger and mostly likely we\u2019ll have a longer duration of treatment.","It\u2019s difficult for me to give you an exact dimension of that market, but it will be certainly bigger in terms of the number of patients and the duration of therapy than the metastatic market in each marketing where there is a significant unmet medical need and we are pleased to see that we have been the first in starting a Phase III trial in that legal setting.","Paul Stoffels","And to add to that, we see very exciting results on the combination of ARN-509 in ZYTIGA we brought it on Board to get to better combination therapy and better outcomes and that is clearly visible in the ongoing clinical work. So we expect a significant improvement on the outcome for our combination therapy and as the basis we\u2019re building the future on for prostate cancer franchise.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","And my follow-on question has to do with INVOKANA, just schematically how big an accelerator do you think it will be to have the combination of metformin in INVOKANA a single administration?","Alex Gorsky","That\u2019s a great question. We are very mainly pleased with the launch of INVOKANA. As Alex mentioned, it\u2019s been the most successful launch in type 2 diabetes since JANUVIA. And we\u2019re now the leading oral anti-diabetic in type 2 among U.S. endocrinologists. The combination of metformin is a very relevant one. The most relevant combination we have that combination approved in Europe with the name of VOKANAMET and we\u2019re expecting a response from the FDA with the PDUFA date in August. So we think it\u2019s going to be an important element for physicians and we\u2019ll have a significant impact in our business moving forward.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","So, two good questions. First, Alex, I wanted to give you an opportunity maybe to break a tie (ph) here. At the Analyst Day, we heard two messages in MD&D, at least we did. In the morning we heard from a lot of your non-orthopedic segments that there was not significant benefit to scale, and in the afternoon we heard a totally different message from Michelle which is that scale really does matter and do you think scale is going to be a driver of share, can you talk a little bit about your breadth and depth in MD&D? And I wondered if you just help us out your view on scale driving share in medical devices, what is that view and why you think we heard different messages from some of your senior business leaders in the morning sessions versus the afternoon sessions just surely focused on orthopedics?","Alex Gorsky","Well, David, I am not sure that the messages were that inconsistent overall. And the way that I would answer that is we do believe scale and size and depth and breadth is going to be important across MD&D. And that has to do with evolving customers right now. I mean when you think about the healthcare landscape going forward whether it\u2019s hospital systems in the United States whether it\u2019s governments in Europe or in the developing markets, we see the opportunity for broader partnerships to be something that customers are both wanting and something that we can definitely provide.","Now I think there is not just one flavor, I think it depends on the system, it depends on the specific customer as to what kind of partnership they may want to have, and I think there could be certain opportunities where a customer might look, might desire to look just across the orthopedics portfolio or perhaps the general surgery area to doing a different kind of partnership or other systems who might be a bit more mature might look for something broader across the entire portfolio. So I think that\u2019s likely the difference in messaging that you\u2019ve heard between some of our global surgery and orthopedics, but overall we do think that we see that as a long-term dynamic and something that will be important and frankly one where we\u2019re positioned very well.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you, Alex, and maybe just a follow-up for Dominic. Dominic just given the strength you\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year specifically OLYSIO. I guess, we\u2019re a little surprised that there hasn\u2019t been sort of more aggressive reinvestment of that upside, is that, what we\u2019re probably going to see here in the back half of 2014, as you think about next year as we head into this year many investors are focused that if there was going to be in OCD related dilution you would offset that with probably more aggressive buyback activity. As we head into \u201915 is it likely we see a more aggressive buyback activity to offset some of the OLYSIO headwind? Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","So couple of comments on the impact of OCD, for this year the OLYSIO benefit does in fact help us absorb the lack of OCD earnings in the back half of the year plus we\u2019re investing in the back half of the year. So our margins overall will not be as significant as you saw in the second quarter because we do intend to invest in the back half of the year for future growth while still overall providing higher earnings that we previously estimated. The share buyback that we talked about regarding the proceeds of the OCD, divestiture we will do that but that \u2013 we\u2019ll see that impact in \u201915 of course because the ability to have an impact of a share buyback this late in the year in \u201914 is very small but that will help us offset the dilution in \u201915, David.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. We\u2019ll take two more questions with respect to everybody\u2019s time. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for taking the question. One for Alex and a follow-up for Dominic. Just wanted to be clear on what you\u2019re seeing with cardiovascular, I know you\u2019ve said that you have great asset and certainly this quarter shows it was Biosense Webster, are you still very much committed to cardiovascular in more a waiting and watching mode to make the right move or are you more in a decision of trying to figure out whether you are committed to cardiovascular?","Alex Gorsky","Kristen, thanks a lot for your question, and let me first of all compliment our EP business and the cardiovascular group for the performance this past year. I believe now we\u2019ve got over 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and when you think of the new technologies like Cardo and others, it\u2019s resulted in great, frankly advancements for patients as well as great growth opportunities for our business. And I would answer your question saying yes, we remain committed to cardiovascular. That being said, we know that we have to be very thoughtful about where we are going to compete and how we might expand our position in that particular market. So as you said, we are doing a watchful waiting. At this point, we continue to watch the other segments, new technologies as they come in seeing what kind of opportunity they may present and we think we will be well positioned going forward based upon how those dynamics evolve.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Perfect. And for Dominic, I was wondering could you just talk a little bit about the pricing and Louise has mentioned surgery. Can you just talk specifically about overall orthopedic pricing if that\u2019s intensifying? And then I think for the first time I\u2019ve seen you mention competitive pricing dynamics was envisioned, can you maybe just expand upon there or any other pricing trends within surgery business as well.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, sure. I\u2019ll let Louise give specifics on orthopedics pricing, but we did see a continual trend by the way, it\u2019s not really new, a continual trend of negative pricing across the medical device space in orthopedics in surgery. We\u2019ve also seen various competitive pricing dynamics even in the vision care business and we\u2019re comparing this now to last year. So we do see increased competitive pricing dynamics and the market is looking for a lower pricing of products. And in orthopedics in particular this quarter we saw it, and Louise if you have in particular the impact for orthopedics.","Louise Mehrotra","So in terms of hips in the U.S., we are seeing a very similar trend of price mix change. So the price is down about 4% but there is a positive mix. So it brings it down to about 3.5%. And in terms of knees, we have in terms of in the U.S., the price down about 2.6% but there is a nice positive impact of mix of about 1.5%, so for a net about 1.1%.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","And trauma?","Louise Mehrotra","Trauma is a net price. So net price and mix together positive about 2.2 and that\u2019s a small negative in the price about 1% and a positive in the mix of about 3%.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Final question please.","Operator","Our final question comes from James Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jay Olson - Goldman Sachs","Hi, Dominic. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the taking the questions. Couple of quick ones. The first with regard to the Synthes tender and trauma. Can you just help us understand the dynamics behind winning these large tenders and specifically, can they be replicated in other regions? And then how do you prevent these large tenders from being driven by price. ","Dominic Caruso","Yes, thanks Jay. Again building on the earlier question, we do think this is an opportunity where our breadth and scale is helpful particularly when customers are prepared to deal with a broader offering and this case we are able to provide it. We have definitely benefitted from that and we expect that to continue and other areas of the market continue to transform. And I think regarding how do you keep that from becoming just a pricing issue, I think it has to do with one of the level of innovation that you are bringing forward; two, what\u2019s the overall partnership and solution that you are building with that particular customer that we think would be instrumental in helping us keep good solid growth going forward.","Louise Mehrotra.","Thank you very much. And some closing remarks from Alex.","Alex Gorsky","So thank you very much everybody and I hope you all agree and as you can see that the diversified business and strategy that we define in our strategic framework that we discussed with you earlier are in fact delivering very strong financial strategic and operational performance and will continue to be the basis to fuel our growth going forward.","I couldn\u2019t be prouder the people of Johnson & Johnson and a big difference they make in living up to the mission of our credo, it\u2019s on behalf of the billions of patients and consumers we serve around the world each day.

This is Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the first quarter of 2017. Accompanying me on the webcast is Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. ","Thank you for joining us today. Our results for the first quarter were consistent with our expectations and aligned to the guidance we provided in January. As you have likely seen in this morning\u2019s press release, we are updating our 2017 guidance to include Actelion assuming closing of the transaction in June. The public tender offer for Actelion is nearing completion and has been declared successful based on the number of shares tendered, subject to satisfaction of remaining closing conditions. We sought regulatory approval in seven jurisdictions and have satisfied requirements in six of them with antitrust approval by the European Commission pending. Dominic will provide further insights on the transaction as well as the impact on all elements of guidance in his remarks following my commentary on results for the company and the three business segments. ","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and accompanying schedules. ","Please note that this morning's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2016 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are all available at investor.jnj.com. ","A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. ","After prepared remarks from Dominic, the remaining time of today\u2019s webcast will be made available to answer your questions. We anticipate today's webcast to last approximately 60 minutes. ","Now on to the results for the first quarter of 2017. Worldwide sales were $17.8 billion for the first quarter of 2017, up 1.6% versus the first quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, sales were up 2% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4%. ","In the U.S., sales were up 0.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.6% as the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported- OUS results by 0.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 1.2% worldwide, declining 0.7% in the U.S. and increasing 3.4% outside the U.S. I will provide the same reference for each segment. ","Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus $1.59 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.83, representing increases of 3.8% and 5.8% respectively, compared to the same period in 2016. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7.5%. Dominic will provide further detail regarding earnings in his remarks. ","I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly business segment sales performance beginning with consumer, highlighting items that build upon the slides that are currently being presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2016 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. ","Worldwide consumer segment sales totaled $3.2 billion, growing operationally 0.8%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, total adjusted operational sales growth declined 2.3% worldwide. As an overarching theme across most consumer franchises, the first quarter results were negatively impacted by global category slowdown, as commented to a numerous reports published in recent weeks by consumer staples analysts and peer commentary highlighting higher gas prices, retailers reducing inventory levels and delayed tax refunds among many factors for slower growth. That slowdown is reflected in results for five out of the six categories we compete in. ","Additionally, after several quarters of higher consumption for many of our products, we did see that moderate primarily in baby care and wound\/other. Finally, we did see macroeconomic conditions such as high unemployment, high inflation, and low consumer confidence impacting our performance in the Latin America region.","Switching to specific platforms. The beauty franchise includes the acquisitions of Vogue, NeoStrata and La Lumiere Light Mask which in total contributed approximately 13 points of growth for the franchise. Vogue sales globally totaled $98 million for the quarter. While worldwide and U.S. market shares remained relatively flat compared to the same period of 2016, the U.S. beauty market is estimated to have contracted by a little more than 1%. Aveeno Adult and NEUTROGENA were each down approximately 1 point. ","The OTC franchise grew 1.5% but when accounting for divestitures, the adjusted growth was approximately 2.4%. Both adult and children's TYLENOL outpaced the respective categories and adult TYLENOL has ascended to be the number two branded product. Growth for the franchise was negatively impacted by approximately 4 points due to unfavorable comparisons for ZYRTEC and RHINOCORT brands in the U.S. where promotional inventory builds were experienced in the first quarter of 2016. ","Concluding the consumer segment, oral care was impacted by the market contracting versus the first quarter of 2016 by approximately 3%. Worldwide market share is flat. However U.S. market share is down by about a half point compared to Q1 2016. ","Regarding our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.2 billion grew 1.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational adjusted sales growth was 2.2% worldwide. As we commented to in the first quarter of 2016, favorable prior period price adjustments or gross to net contributed approximately $200 million to the first quarter 2016 results in the U.S. This is a comparative headwind for the first quarter 2017 growth rate of 2.5 points which when added would take the worldwide pharmaceutical growth rate to 4.7%. On a product basis, the negative impact on U.S. growth rates is approximately 13 points for STELARA and 4 points each for XARELTO and REMICADE. ","In oncology, DARZALEX continued its strong performance with worldwide sales of $255 million as it\u2019s experiencing strong adoption following mid-year 2016 launches outside the U.S. DARZALEX maintains its leadership in line 4 plus multiple myeloma and we are seeing accelerated adoption in the U.S. for the multiple myeloma one prior line setting pursuant to the approvals of dose indications late last year. ","IMBRUVICA in the U.S. gained approximately 8 points of market share across all lines of therapy based on the fourth quarter data and the CLL market is estimated to have grown approximately 20%. Outside the U.S. we continue to experience strong uptake in the G5 countries. Negative ZYTIGA growth in the U.S. was the result of higher utilization of independent patient assistance foundations, a dynamic that has carried over from the fourth quarter of 2016. ","In immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 5%. STELARA in the U.S. gained 0.6 points of market share in psoriasis versus the first quarter of 2016. We are very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease following the launch late last year of this new indication as more than 6000 patients are utilizing STELARA for Crohn's treatment. ","REMICADE in the U.S. when accounting for the 2016 prior period price adjustments referenced earlier was modestly higher with volume growth, partly offset by increased discounting. The REMICADE export business continues to see the impact of biosimilar competition in Europe. ","INVOKANA, INVOKAMET sales in the U.S. were negative due to lower price. In addition to increasing discounts for managed care contracting, there was also an impact from channel mix with a higher composition of sales now occurring in the Medicaid channel. For XARELTO, total prescription market share is up more than 2 points versus a year ago, as warfarin share is down to 51% versus 58% in the first quarter of 2016. We are seeing some higher discounting in managed care and government channels for preferred access physicians. ","We equalize annual costs associated with the Medicare coverage gap, also known as the donut hole, over each quarter throughout the year. The timing of when these costs were assigned to each brand in 2016 had an impact for year-on-year comparisons. Taking this into account, coupled with the impact from last year's favorable prior period price adjustment previously referenced, growth for XARELTO for the quarter was approximately a positive 2%. ","In neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate long-acting injectable portfolio achieved strong results in all major regions due to increasing market share. CONCERTA in the U.S. is experiencing negative price due to the re-entry of generic competition. Other neuroscience was impacted by the 2016 divestiture of the Noramco API business which accounted for $60 million of lower sales. ","I\u2019ll now turn our attention to the medical device segment. Worldwide medical devices sales were $6.3 billion, growing 3.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.7% worldwide. ","Vision Care results now include the Medical Optics business which we acquired from Abbott in a transaction that closed on February 27. The one month of sales totaled $124 million for that business. The contact lens business grew approximately 5%, continuing its trend of market share gains through new product introduction, namely OASYS 1-Day products globally and variants of the DEFINE lens outside the US. ","Hospital medical device growth of 2% was driven by our priority platforms which as a reminder we consider to be electrophysiology, endocutters, energy, knees and trauma. Combined, that set of businesses grew operationally 6.5%. Electrophysiology grew approximately 17% worldwide as atrial fibrillation procedures continued to grow, estimated at 11% for the quarter in the U.S. and 14% outside the U.S. Strong adoption of newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters continued. This business has grown double digit percentages in 29 out of the last 30 quarters. ","Within the advanced surgery category, endocutters grew 10% primarily driven by GST and PBS growth globally. Energy growth of 6.9% was driven by the inclusion of the Megadyne acquisition and strong OUS performance from new products in China and Europe. ","The specialty surgery business was down compared to the first quarter of 2016 driven by U.S. declines in the aesthetics and advanced sterilization businesses. Within orthopaedics, knee growth was driven by continued uptake of ATTUNE outside the US, particularly in China and the Middle East Africa region. Trauma, including sales from the acquisition of Biomedical Enterprises was flat versus a year ago. Growth in hips was generated by continued uptake of the CORAIL primary stem system in the U.S. and the launch of the GRIPTION platform in China. ","Pricing pressure continued across the major categories in orthopaedics but was partially offset by favorable mix. For the quarter in the U.S. net price in hips was negative 2.1%, knees negative 1.7%, positive 0.2% in trauma and positive 2.8% in spine.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's 2017 first quarter. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred in the first quarter. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. ","Dominic Caruso","Thanks Joe and good morning everyone. As Joe has outlined for you, our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter as part of the full year guidance that we provided in January. Though we had some challenging dynamics and difficult comparisons regarding sales this quarter, we remain on track to achieving our full year sales and earnings guidance. ","Since Joe walked you through the sales results for its business, I would like to add some overall commentary on those results, discuss our operating performance and what we expect for the balance of the year. ","We continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers as our CEO Alex Gorsky described for you on our last conference call. In our pharmaceutical business we saw a very little impact in the first quarter from biosimilar competition to REMICADE in the U.S. ","Joe mentioned some of the comparative challenges we encountered this quarter but adjusting for those factors and the impact of divestitures, we grew at 4.7% operationally which we believe is at or even slightly above projected market growth rates. Our newer products in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience continue to deliver solid growth, and we have one of the best pipelines in the industry. We look forward to providing an in-depth review of that pipeline at our upcoming pharmaceutical business review meeting on May 17. ","In our consumer business, we saw category deceleration in Q1 across many of the markets we compete in, along with continued macro-economic factors in Latin America and Asia which impacted growth. Many industry reports suggest that the consumer category will rebound in the near term and we believe we will be well positioned to grow above market through geographic expansion of current products, the acceleration of our recent acquisitions, and the introduction of new products which are expected to generate approximate 2 points of incremental growth going forward in 2017. ","And in medical devices, our Vision Care business had solid growth from recently launched products and our newly acquired Surgical Vision business is growing at over twice the rate it grew in the first quarter of 2016. In our hospital medical device group, we saw our priority growth platforms that now represent approximately 40% of our sales deliver solid growth of approximately 6.5% operationally, while some of the core categories did experience slower growth. ","As you know we have been managing our portfolio through divestitures and strategic acquisitions, including several new products and technologies in faster areas of growth such as our recently announced acquisition of Neuravi, a novel technology for ischemic stroke and we expect new products to accelerate our growth for the balance of the year by 1.5 to 2 points. ","Our guidance from January also included the expectation that our adjusted pretax operating margins should be stable to slightly higher in 2017. We were pleased to see that our disciplined expense management delivered on this expectation in the first quarter with a 50 basis point improvement in our adjusted pretax operating margin to 33.4%. And while we expect investment levels to increase throughout the year, we continue to expect that we will maintain to slightly improved adjusted pretax operating margin for the full year. ","Finally, as Joe pointed out earlier we have had many positive developments concerning the steps needed to close the Actelion transaction and we expect to complete our acquisition of Actelion by the end of the second quarter. As a result, in a few minutes I will provide 2017 guidance for you to update your models that includes the expected impact of Actelion on our full year 2017 results. ","But first, I'd like to highlight some key points regarding our first quarter operating results. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2017. As we\u2019ve mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 2% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, it was 1.2%. If you direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items. ","As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2017 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of approximately $616 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: intangible asset amortization expense of $244 million, a charge for the continuing restructuring of our hospital medical device business of $121 million, and the AMO acquisition related cost of approximately $251 million. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.83, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 5.8% versus the prior year and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.86 or up 7.5% over the prior year. ","Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 20 basis points, primarily due to manufacturing cost improvements which were partially offset by transactional currency impacts. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.6% of sales, or 20 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to cost management. ","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.6% and in line with the prior year as we continued to advance our promising product pipelines. Interest expense, net of interest income, was higher than last year due to higher debt levels. Other income and expense was a net gain of $160 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $40 million in the same period last year. There are no significant items in this line in either the current or the prior year periods. ","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.5% compared to 16.3% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. The first quarter rate is lower than the annual effective rate we provided in January and likely lower than many of your models as the timing of the benefits associated with stock based compensation tax accounting primarily impacts the first quarter as we described last year. ","Turning to the next slide, I\u2019ll now review adjusted income before tax by segment. On our 2016 year end call we commented on our segment results adjusted for income tax \u2013 adjusted for earnings before tax versus the prior year. Now that our competitors have reported their results for 2016, I'd like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2016 adjusted income before tax was 31.7% compared to 26.7% weighted average for our competitors. ","In the first quarter of 2017, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 120 basis points versus the first quarter of 2016 driven by higher operating profit, some favorability in other income. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, medical devices at 31.6% is lower than the previous year primarily due to unfavorable transaction currency within cost of goods sold. Pharmaceutical margins improved from the prior year by 400 basis points primarily driven by lower manufacturing costs and favorable product mix. And consumer margins improved to 20.2% now estimated at benchmark levels while still making the necessary investments to deliver future growth. ","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2017. Today we will be providing guidance that assumes we close on our acquisition of Actelion by the end of the second quarter. Before I move to that guidance, I would like to reiterate our guidance from January which remains unchanged without the impact of Actelion. As a reminder, that guidance was as follows: we expected operational sales to increase 4% to 5% for the year; this would result in sales for 2017 on a constant currency basis of approximately $74.8 billion to $75.5 billion. ","Our operational sales guidance for 2017 on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was expected to reflect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Our adjusted EPS guidance expected a range of $7.05 to $7.20 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 5% to 7%. ","I will now provide our complete full year of 2017 guidance now, including the expected impact of Actelion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $7 billion of net cash which consists of approximately $39 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $32 billion of debt which reflects our cash position following the close of Abbott Medical Optics and our recent debt offering. As a reminder, we plan to complete our share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter. ","Also, by the end of the second quarter we expect that we will have closed on the Actelion acquisition at a purchase price of approximately $30 billion. Therefore for purposes of your models and assuming no other significant uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $600 million and $700 million. ","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corporation divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2017 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion which is consistent with our previous guidance. And for taxes, our guidance today does not include any assumptions about potential tax reform measures. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2017, excluding special items, is approximately 19% to 20%, also consistent with our previous guidance. ","Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2017 now includes the expected impact of Actelion and already had included the impact of Abbott Medical Optics, which closed in the first quarter, as well as the expected impact of REMICADE biosimilars which we consider to be at risk due to ongoing patent litigation. In addition, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PROCRIT, PREZISTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. ","We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2017 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 5.8% and 6.8% for the year. This would result in sales for 2017 on a constant currency basis of approximately $76.1 billion to $76.8 billion. This is higher than our January guidance as it now includes the expected impact of Actelion. ","Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro as an example as of last week at $1.07, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1%. Plus under this scenario, we expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 4.8% to 5.8% for total expected level of reported sales of approximately $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion. ","And now turning to earnings. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range between $7.12 and $7.27 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 6% to 8%, an increase of $0.07 over our January adjusted EPS guidance. If currency exchange rates for all of 2017 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share due solely to currency movements. Therefore we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted earnings per share ranging from $7 to $7.15 per share or a growth rate of between 4% and 6%. As it is still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. ","Our estimate of the immediate positive impact to adjusted earnings from the anticipated second quarter closing of the Actelion transaction assumes we will exercise an option related to one of the R&D programs in the R&D spinoff company Idorsia later this year, which will increase our R&D expense for 2017. At this early stage we remain comfortable with our estimate of a positive first full year impact to adjusted earnings per share of between $0.35 and $0.45 per share. We will of course update you further on this estimate when we provide full year 2018 guidance. ","So in closing, we are raising our operational sales and EPS guidance to include the expected impact of our acquisition of Actelion and we remain optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely: we are expecting operational sales growth of between 5.8% and 6.8%; we continue to deploy good cost management and expect to maintain or slightly improve our pretax operating margins. Our operational adjusted earnings per share growth in our guidance remains strong in the range of 6% to 8% consistent with our goal of growing earnings faster than sales. And our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our near term priorities. ","And we're pleased to continue seeing significant milestones in our pharmaceutical pipeline and are confident in the continued growth expectations for that business. In fact, we look forward to discussing this with you in more detail at our May 17 pharmaceutical business review day. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn things back over to Joe to open up the Q&A portion of the call. Joe?","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Dominic. Manny, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin ","Thank you. Dominic, just a couple questions for you -- I'm just trying to get my head around the new guidance and you did a nice job explaining all the pieces, but -- so this quarter you beat by $0.10, but for the full year you're only raising guidance by $0.07 and that does include the impact of Actelion. You did mention that this is just a half year impact, so even if I assume that you wouldn\u2019t experience the full half-year impact -- even if I assume that the synergy impact is back-half weighted and assume that you only benefit from, say, a third of the synergy, I am still coming up a little short. Perhaps it is this R&D expenditure that explains the difference but that would seem to be -- that might explain only part of the difference. So if you could just walk through again the different pieces -- I'm surprised that the guidance didn't come in above given your original Actelion guidance but again I'm sure that there are timing issues in this R&D expense, that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up question on REMICADE; thinks. ","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Hi good morning, Jami. Well, just a few things. So regarding our first quarter results of $1.83, that's about $0.06 higher than current estimates. You could break that down between $0.03 or $0.04 related to a lower tax rate than is in the Street\u2019s models for the first quarter and the balance related to basically good cost management. ","With respect to that tax rate, we did not change the tax rate for the year. So the lower tax rate in the first quarter compared to what is in many of your models really is just timing related to the stock based compensation accounting which is mostly reflected in the first quarter. So -- and through the balance of the year we do expect some increased investment which would offset some of that favorability in expenses in the first quarter. ","Regarding next year for Actelion, in the first full year 2018 we\u2019re still confident with our $0.35 to $0.45 per share. If we look at this half year, it\u2019s a couple things going on. First of all, you're exactly right. I mentioned the R&D -- the option we have with respect to one of the R&D programs in the spinoff company and we're assuming that we will exercise that option which will impact our R&D expense in the latter half of the year as a cost, that's worth about $0.08, we gave guidance that's about $0.07 higher related to adding Actelion, let's call that $0.15 for half a year of Actelion assuming that the option wasn't exercised, and that's just slightly lower than the half a year at $0.35 or so for next year and that's because all of the synergies related to the transaction really ramp up in 2018, not in the early stages of the integration in 2017. So hopefully that clears things off. ","Jami Rubin ","Yes, that\u2019s definitely helped. So the $0.35 to $0.40 is really a second -- the first full year?","Dominic Caruso","That's correct. ","Jami Rubin ","That's not including \u2013 I mean the original press release said first full year which was from the time you closed, so \u2013 ","Dominic Caruso","So, yes, the $0.35 to $0.45 is 2018\u2019s estimate.","Jami Rubin ","Okay, that's helpful. Just second question on REMICADE, the impact from biosimilar is, as you said, very minimal. What are your expectations for the remainder of the year? And then lastly, I am curious your thoughts, Dominic, on prospects for corporate tax reform and repatriation, just given some of the dysfunction in Washington. Thank you very much. ","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well for REMICADE we saw very little impact in the first quarter. Of course, it's early because the product just launched at the end of last year. As you know there is no interchangeability, so we certainly don't expect that decisions will switch patients, they may start new patients on therapy. But with the long history that we have of REMICADE\u2019s efficacy and safety, we believe patients will move slowly to switch to a biosimilar and we've incorporated that planned utilization in our guidance for the year and hasn't changed from the time we gave guidance in January, which is well before we saw any impact in the quarter. ","With respect to tax reform and what we expect to happen, I was actually just in Washington last week and one of the things that I think is very clear is that the House has a plan that they want to move forward which includes the border adjustment tax, that has not yet been adopted by the Senate, although everyone agrees that some innovation in the way jobs will be created in the U.S. is important and I would say the grand summary from my takeaway was that both the House and the Senate are waiting for guidance from the White House on whether they prefer the border adjustment tax or whether they have another vehicle that they would like to implement. And while everyone is waiting for that, things have in fact stalled as you said, but I am confident that we're talking about the right things, we're talking about a lower U.S. tax rate, we're talking about a territorial system and we're talking about some innovation and some incentive for job creation in the U.S. And that latter point is the one that's up for discussion waiting for some clarity and preference from the White House. ","Joseph Wolk","Manny, next question. Maybe before we take the question, I just want to make sure in the last dialogue there was a reference to $0.35 to $0.45 and $0.30 to $0.40, just want to for clarity for your models, it's $0.35 to $0.40 for the first full year of Actelion. Next question, Manny please. ","Operator","Next question is from Mike Weinstein of JP Morgan. ","Michael Weinstein ","Thanks and maybe just to add to that, Joe, the $0.35 to $0.40 is a net number that assumes a certain level of reinvestment back into the company \u2013 so Actelion -- right on a gross basis?","Joseph Wolk","That's correct, Mike.","Dominic Caruso","That's correct Mike; that's correct. ","Michael Weinstein ","Dominic, I think what would be helpful is, is you\u2019ve made a number of comments about both consumer and pharmaceuticals and I think that it would probably be helpful to help -- give your perspective on what you saw this quarter that you think was one time in nature and what you think that -- what you think will persist over the balance of 2017, for both of those businesses?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, with consumer I would say that what was a little bit more pronounced in our expectation was going into the year was the level at which the category growth that we compete -- the categories that we compete in decelerated. That of course then turns into inventory destocking, if you will, by the various trades. That's a phenomenon that we think is not long lived, because obviously eventually as consumption either picks up or even continues at a reasonable pace, inventory will need to be restocked at the trade, so we'll see some corrections to that. ","Plus, with respect to our own business, we have a number of new product launches, very few of them hit the first quarter, they're all scheduled that now second quarter, third and fourth and those as I said earlier could impact our total growth rate by an incremental two points of growth going forward. So we don't think that the first quarter results for consumer will continue at that pace that we just saw; we think they will improve throughout the year. ","With respect to pharmaceuticals, I mentioned that we were pleased to not see much of an impact in REMICADE biosimilar, there may be some additional impact as we go through the year but nothing's changed our estimates for that, it's all baked into our guidance. We did see -- we did see some pricing dynamics particularly in the cardiovascular metabolic space, so INVOKANA and XARELTO. Those are competitive markets, lots of entries in that market and therefore the payer dynamics are more competitive there. So we saw some lower pricing there; that's also baked into our estimates for the quarter, so not something dramatically different than what we expected. ","Michael Weinstein ","Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, but a couple of items, just to follow up. So one, I wanted to get some clarity on your view of the upcoming IPR decision on ZYTIGA, this is on the 438 patent. Does the outcome of the 438 IPR have any impact on your 30-month stay? Our impression is no in that regardless, you wouldn't see generic competition prior to October 2018?","Dominic Caruso","That's correct, Mike. That's our position as well, that whatever the outcome is of that hearing it will not impact the 30 month stay. ","Michael Weinstein ","Okay, then last item. On the upcoming presentation of the CANVAS trial, there's been some discussion on the Street about the study in which you may or may not know about the results of the trial today. Is there anything you want to add relative to just the change in expectation of that study?","Dominic Caruso","Well, we\u2019re going to unveil the results of that study in June at the ADA meeting, so it\u2019d be premature to comment there. Joe, do you have anything else to add?","Joseph Wolk","No, that\u2019s currently the only scheduled release date at this point in time. ","Operator","Next question is from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch ","Thank you very much for taking the question. Could we take a look at the big picture med-tech, what you are seeing as it relates to the usual suspects of volume, price and how we\u2019re entering the year?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well couple things, I mean in terms of our med-tech business, as you know we have a focus on certain priority platforms that are about 40% of our business, and I said earlier they're growing about 6.5%. And that does have some pricing pressure in it, so the volume seems very good there. Overall med tech or let me just call it hospital procedures and overall volumes in the U.S. hospital setting seem to be relatively flat, not much growth from quarter to quarter, so relatively stable but no inflection point in growth for sure. ","And with respect to products in our core platforms, those products are generally more susceptible to more significant price impacts. Joe, anything else you want to add to that?","Joseph Wolk","Joanne, one way we typically answer these questions around utilization trends, and so this day that lags a little bit but in the fourth quarter for hospital admissions it was up almost a percent; surgical procedures were down about a half percent, and lab procedures were up a percent. We see anywhere based on our very preliminary estimates for the first quarter of 2017 they were from flat to 1% up across all three of those categories. ","Dominic Caruso","But I would say no significant acceleration or change in the pricing dynamics that we've been seeing. So steady as she goes with respect to slightly negative price across the industry. ","Joanne Wuensch ","That's very helpful. Can we turn off to some of your portfolio management? Specifically last quarter you talked about your diabetes franchise being evaluated on strategic basis, and then also early comments on the AMO integration. Thank you. ","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, with respect to diabetes, we continue that process, we're evaluating various options for that business, whether it be partnership or outright divestiture or whatever is best in terms of giving that position -- giving that business the best position to succeed and obviously getting -- if we were to divest it getting the right return for our shareholders. ","With respect to the AMO acquisition, it's going really really well, I mean it just obviously was integrated in February, we welcomed the AMO colleagues to Johnson & Johnson. They are very important part of now a complete health offering that we have at Johnson & Johnson, coupled with the ACUVUE brand which obviously has great recognition, the innovation that we already know about and know how to do well both in manufacturing and lens technology. I think this is going to be a fantastic acquisition for us; it's off to a great start and quite frankly before we acquired them in the quarter they were doing really well with new product launches growing at a rate that was double the rate that they were growing at last year's first quarter. So we're very pleased, it's off to a great start. ","Joseph Wolk","And just for clarity, as folks look at the schedules that we provide, the AMO business will be split into two categories. The consumer solutions business will be put in with the contact lens portion of the business and surgery will be carved out on its own. So for the quarter we had $124 million recognized in sales from the AMO acquisition, $115 million of that was in the surgery category.","Operator","The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen ","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic, can you please confirm that the $1 billion from \u2013 or tell us if the billion dollars from the Codman neuro business divestiture if that\u2019s included in the current guidance or not and if you will include it in operational EPS in 2017? And second, Dominic, you maintain a 3% to 3.5% underlying growth, but I think you did about 1.2% in Q1. So what gets better in Q2 through Q4 and do you still expect the medical device and consumer division\u2019s growth rate to accelerate in 2017 over 2016? I think you said that on the Q4 call. Thanks and I just have one follow up. ","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, Larry, we have a number of plans with respect to various divestitures. We announced Codman because it was the most significant of those that we have plans with, but the basket of all of those is what we have included in our earnings guidance for the year of 1.1% to 1.3% in the other income line. So it'll be part of that other income line and not excluded from our earnings. And as you know we always take the opportunity to reinvest those gains back into the business. So we don't expect that it will have that much of a significant impact on overall earnings as our -- as I mentioned earlier our investment levels will go up, the system was recognizing those gains. ","Couple things with respect to medical devices and consumer, as I mentioned earlier we do expect product launches in the remaining part of the year, adding about 1.8% growth in the medical devices and about 2% growth versus the current levels to consumer. In medical devices we also had some tough comparisons in the first quarter. We still had some inventory destocking and distributor issues in China which obviously won\u2019t repeat going forward in the year. And likewise in consumer we have as I mentioned this category deceleration which we think will improve throughout the balance of the year. We currently expect that consumer will do about the same as it did last year and if the deceleration in the category growth continues further, then we expect that it would do slightly less. Medical devices about on par now with next year but I do think that it will be at or very close to the market growth rates for the industry overall. ","Joseph Wolk","The headwinds in the first quarter, Larry, to be aware in the medical devices, we had approximately 0.4 less selling days, if you will, it's obviously not selling days but procedure days. So that was worth about 60 basis points. And then also in consumer you had about a 50 basis point impact due to some remaining affects from India demonetization as well as Article 94 in China. ","Larry Biegelsen ","That's helpful. Guys, on your ortho, hip and knee, your recon business is doing well but the spine continues to struggle. You talked about product gaps there. What are those product gaps? How do you address them? And trauma, that was also soft; when do you expect that to bounce back? Thanks for taking the questions. ","Dominic Caruso","So with trauma, let me take that. With trauma, that's the business that we saw this inventory destocking issue with changes in distributors in China as I mentioned earlier. So that was an impact in the first quarter that we don't expect to continue. Spine, some product gaps there that I would point to are expandable cage and we just did acquire an expandable cage, so we expect we will have a good offering in that particular segment of the market as well. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. ","Matt Miksic ","Thanks good morning and thanks for taking the question. One, on the recent acquisition that you announced, Neuravi and sort of backing up and looking at your med device strategic activity over the last year or so. This is, I guess, maybe the third or fourth, this is the latest in a series of these kind of smaller acquisitions, putting AMO aside. And I just wonder if some of those in AFib, some of those in surgery, this one of course I don't believe lines up with the current field force or call points that you have. But Dominic, it could be helpful maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how this fits in with your strategy, whether these kinds of things or what we should expect going forward? And if there's anything in particular about Neuravi, whether it's data or a buildout that we should know about? And then I have one follow up. ","Dominic Caruso","Well, Matt, thanks for the question. In our neurovascular or neurosurgery business, we obviously have sales presence. And as you recall we announced that we have an offer to divest the Codman neurosurgery business. What we're talking about with Neuravi is the piece of the Codman business where we already have sales force in place, dealing with the ischemic stroke as opposed to hemorrhagic stroke which is dealt with in the other part of the business. And this is consistent with our strategy of moving our portfolio to the higher growth areas of any category. And so you're right to point out that we've been doing this quite often, we've been divesting slower growth areas or areas that we think are better off in someone else's hands and investing in higher growth areas and new technologies. This particular ischemic stroke treatment from Neuravi is already on the market in Europe and expected to be approved this year in the U.S. and it provides for faster blood flow and more accurate retrieval of the clot within the neurovascular system. So we're very excited about it. ","By the way, our entire medical device business has largely been grown by these smaller tuck-in bolt-on acquisitions with technologies that advance the standard of care and with our scale in distribution we're able to do much better with that asset in our hands than in the hands of the previous owner. ","Matt Miksic ","That's helpful and then one follow up on some of the pharma comments that you made. You talked a little bit about some pricing pressure in competitive markets. You of course have put out through recent report on transparency in pricing, and just wondering if you could comment at all on any changes we should be thinking about in terms of whether it is more competition like this and pressure related in that way or whether it's a different sort of pricing -- price increase profile for your portfolio pharma; any kind of color you can lay out for us in terms of what we should be dialing in or thinking about some of the changes in rebate and pricing in pharma?","Dominic Caruso","Well, overall, Matt, we have an innovative portfolio in pharma and the innovation comes with greater patient outcome and therefore evidence that supports the pricing for the products. That's the vast majority of the portfolio in oncology, immunology, neuroscience. In certain parts of the portfolio cardiovascular and metabolic in particular, that's a little bit more crowded; it's not a specialty focused, more primary care focused. And that's where the payer community has more influence over rebates and the like. I don't think that we're going to see a dramatic change in our pricing methodologies, it's all evidence based. We look at it annually and as you know from our last report that you just mentioned, the difference between list price and net price is pretty dramatic and we think that that will continue. And so we've had modest price increases on a net price basis and we think that'll be the case going forward. ","Operator","The next question is from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Bob Hopkins ","Thanks very much for taking the question. So two things, the first on devices and then on pharma. And then on devices, it\u2019s sort of a follow up to some of the things that have been asked in terms of the leadership changes on the divestitures and acquisitions.","I was wondering, Dominic, if you can just give us a sense as to kind of where are we in the process? Should we expect kind of more strategic activity in devices? Is it a potential for larger transactions in devices given kind of the level of activity and changes at the top in devices over the course of last year, would love to get an update on kind of where we are in your process?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, couple things, Bob. The restructuring was announced more than a year ago, I guess January of 2016. So we've been in the process of restructuring the medical device business. We've been making changes in the portfolio well before any leadership changes were announced. I think that will just continue; it's not going to dramatically change as a result of any leadership changes; that's a strategic point of view that we have on various markets. But I don't think that'll change. ","I don't think any one particular leadership group will have an influence one way or another over whether we do larger or smaller transactions, are all individually analysed. We're very disciplined about it, they have to be strategic, they have to return a weighted average IRR that's higher than our weighted average cost of capital. So none of that changes just because of leadership changes. I don\u2019t think that you should expect any dramatic change there. I would expect a continual improvement in the business over time all of which has been started over a year ago. It takes time to improve a business that's so widespread and diverse as our medical device business but we're making good progress. And I would just reiterate that we expect it to have nearly a billion dollars of cost improvements in that business achieved by 2018 and we're well on our way of doing that. So I don't expect any changes there as well. ","Bob Hopkins ","So I guess just in terms of the potential for larger transactions in devices, how would you kind of comment on that? And then the other quick -- and I just want to get your view on -- and this is just a quick question on the pharma growth. The difference between the 2.2% that you mentioned in terms of the pharma growth this quarter and the 4.7% I think you said, I know it has a lot to do with pricing but maybe you could just kind of break that down as many pieces you're willing to give?","Dominic Caruso","With respect to larger in devices or larger in any business it's really the same for us, it's not really focused on any one business being more focused on larger or smaller, has to do with whether or not it's an area of strategic importance for us, whether the asset is one that we think we can grow better in our hands than in the hands of the previous owner, and whether we're going to get a return for our shareholders that's commensurate with the risk that we have by putting our shareholders capital to work. So really doesn't vary in devices, consumer, or pharma in any regard with respect to whether one business would be more likely to have a larger versus smaller acquisition, depends on each individual transaction and we're really agnostic, although I will say in medical devices are history has been a great deal of bolt-on acquisitions and now and then a pretty large acquisition, the largest one we did was Synthes now five years ago or thereabouts. ","With respect to your question on pharma, 2.2% versus 4.7% \u2013 the 2.2% growth is pharma ex acquisitions and divestiture impact and the 4.7 pharma growth has to do with simply adjusting for the $200 million of purchase price adjustments that were recorded in the first quarter of 2016 -- their prior period adjustments I should say were related to Medicaid rebates, managed care rebates that were late in reporting into us and therefore we've recorded all those in the first quarter of 2016, they had nothing to do with 2016, they're all from prior periods. So we excluded that in the calculation of the 4.7% to give you an apple to apples underlying growth rate for the pharma business; hopefully that's clear now. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dane Leone of BTIG.","Dane Leone ","Thank you for taking the questions. So when you think about the Actelion merger and just the general strategy in pharma, several times on the call have come up and just different trends in pricing and have better markets are -- just curious could you just kind of reiterate the strategy in terms of going more into a cardiovascular space even though you know there's more differentiation. Just in general to the comments of cardiovascular metabolic being more competitive and having more of an effect on pricing especially in the US, how you see Actelion fitting in and kind of the diversification of portfolio?","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Dane. Well, in the cardiovascular space with respect to Actelion, I mean that's not primary care, it's more specialty based. So therefore it's consistent with our overall strategy of being focused in specialty, pharmaceutical areas more so than in primary care. So I don't see the same kind of pricing dynamics in the specialty area that you do in the primary care area. Hopefully that\u2019s clear. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. ","David Lewis ","Dominic, I just wanted to come back to consumer and a quick follow up. Just the things you mentioned the consumer this quarter all seem largely either transitory or tied to the broader industry. But the big thing we talked about this quarter in consumer has really been accelerating e-commerce risk. And I wonder if you sort of talk about that, do you see e-commerce as an accelerating risk to the JNJ businesses or do you think that your brands are frankly more durable? And also about the 20% margins, you've got there dramatically faster than you ever expected. So strategically from here is the focus to get to 25% margins or reinvestment and I had a quick follow up. ","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, a couple things -- e-commerce is not a risk, it's a real obvious trend in industry where we're well positioned in getting better positioned. Our brands are iconic in nature, they do still have quite an appeal to a mass audience and you see us continuing to advertise for example with Neutrogena, and Aveeno and Tylenol. So we think those brands still hold up well in more classic marketing although we're very present in e-commerce and products like Vogue and others that we\u2019re acquiring in the consumer brand in the consumer space specialty kind of brands fit really well in the e-commerce strategy. ","With respect to the second part of your question, could you just repeat that again please?","Yeah, well, a couple things, I mean obviously we were on a long plan to improve the margins in this business but I think as Alex often mentions first things first. So now that the business has worked through the issues that it had in the OTC. business although it's still under a consent decree, I just want to remind you we are focused on cost improvement programs and while at the same time investing. So there's no particular focus or goal to get to one particular pretax operating margin number. We expect it to be competitive with the industry which it now is but we're obviously going to take the opportunity to invest when we can especially as I mentioned we're launching new products this year. So we're going to make sure we invest behind those launches and make sure they do exceptionally well right out of the gate. ","End of Q&A","Joseph Wolk","Great, thank you David. And thanks for everyone for their questions and apologies to those we couldn't get to today. I will now turn it back to Dominic for some closing comments. ","Dominic Caruso","Thanks Joe. Well as I noted earlier we're confident in our guidance for 2017 and we're optimistic for the future. I would like to take this moment to recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their important contributions and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for your time this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year and I hope to see you all at our pharmaceutical business review meeting on May 17. Thanks and have a great day. ","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen and this concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. And it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2012. Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This call is being made available through a broader audience via a webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.","I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the first quarter for the corporation and highlights for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the first quarter financial results and discuss guidance for the full year of 2012. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour. Included with the press release that was sent to the investment community earlier this morning is a schedule showing sales for major products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These are also available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release.","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2011 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.","Last item. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2012. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were $16.1 billion dollars for the first quarter of 2012, down 0.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. On an operational basis, sales were up 1% and currency had a negative impact of 1.2%. In the U.S., sales decreased 5.1%, impacted by generic competition for LEVAQUIN and CONCERTA. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 6.4%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.3 points. The strong growth in the regions outside the U.S. was primarily due to the success of new product launches and the impact of the amended agreement with Merck regarding REMICADE and SIMPONI. I will discuss these items in more detail in the segment commentary. The Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 23.3% operationally, while Europe grew 4.5% operationally. The Asia-Pacific Africa region grew 1.2% on an operational basis.","If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $3.9 billion compared to $3.5 billion in the same period in 2011. Earnings per share were $1.41 versus $1.25 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the accompanying tables on the non-GAAP measures, 2012 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after-tax net impact of a currency adjustment related to the planned acquisition of Synthes, partially offset by costs associated with the acquisition. First quarter results for 2011 were adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of litigation expense and a few ASR Hip recall costs. Net earnings on an adjusted basis were $3.8 billion and earnings per share were $1.37, up 1.5% versus the first quarter of 2011.","I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. For the first quarter, cost of goods sold at 30.4% of sales was 90 basis points higher than the same period in 2011 primarily due to the ongoing remediation work in our OTC business and unfavorable mix, including the impact of the Crucell business. First quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses at 31.1% of sales were down 20 basis points due to cost-containment initiatives across many of our businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.2%, 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to the timing of milestone payments. Interest expense, net of interest income of $130 million, was up $26 million versus the first quarter of 2011 due to a higher average debt balance.","Other income net of other expense was $611 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $13 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense was $494 million in 2012 compared to $359 million in 2011. 2012 results include the gain related to the divestiture of Bystolic while 2011 results included the gain related to the equity investment in Crucell. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 22.8% in the first quarter of 2012, in line with the 2011 rate.","Turning now to business segment highlights. Please refer to the supplementary sales schedules highlighting major products or businesses for the first quarter of 2012. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the first quarter of 2012 of $3.6 billion decreased 2.4% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales decreased 0.6%, while the impact of currency was negative 1.8%. U.S. sales were down 2.2%, while international sales grew 0.4% on an operational basis. Baby care products declined on an operational basis by 1.4% when compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to lower sales of lotions and powders, partially offset by stronger sales of wipes. ","Sales in the oral care business increased 0.7% on an operational basis with U.S. down 4.9% and international sales up 4.7% on an operational basis. Strong international sales of LISTERINE from recently launched products were partially offset by lower U.S. sales of floss. For the first quarter of 2012, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals decreased 0.3% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2011. Sales in the U.S. were down 4% primarily due to supply constraints on certain products, partially offset by the return to the market of other key products and the impact of the acquisition of full ownership rights to certain digestive health products.","McNeil-PPC is operating under a Consent Decree covering the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Fort Washington and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McNeil continues to operate the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras and Lancaster. As we previously discussed, production volumes from these facilities continue to be impacted by additional review and approval processes. We expect this to continue throughout 2012 and most of 2013. The Fort Washington manufacturing site is not in operation at this time. We anticipate it will be ready for the FDA to begin their certification review process for this facility in late 2013.","Sales outside the U.S. were up 1.7% on an operational basis due to the recent acquisition of the DOKTOR MOM and RINZA brands from J. B. Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals and the successful launch of new smoking cessation products. Our Skin Care business grew 2.1% on an operational basis in the first quarter of 2012 with sales in the U.S. up 6.3% and sales outside the U.S. down 1.7% on an operational basis. Strong sales of Neutrogena in the U.S. due to the success of new product launches were partially offset by lower international sales. A softer market in certain regions has impacted the international sales.","Women's health declined 8.2% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. were down 25.6%, while sales outside U.S. were down 1.7% on an operational basis. The sales decline this quarter was primarily due to the impact of divestitures of certain brands. Wound care\/other sales increased 3.3% on an operational basis compared to the same period last year due to new product launches. That completes our review of the Consumer segment. And I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceuticals segment.","Worldwide net sales for the first quarter of $6.1 billion increased 1.2% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 2.6% with a negative currency impact of 1.4 points. Sales in the U.S. decreased 10.8%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 19.6%. The loss of marketing exclusivity for LEVAQUIN in June last year and the May 2011 supply and distribution agreement with Watson Laboratories, Inc. to distribute an authorized generic version of CONCERTA in the U.S. negatively impacted worldwide Pharmaceutical operational sales growth by approximately 9 points and U.S. growth by approximately 14 points. Positively impacting sales growth in the quarter were sales related to the February 2011 acquisition of Crucell and the impact of the amended agreement with Merck, partially offset by divestitures. Excluding the items mentioned, the underlying worldwide operational growth was approximately 9% with similar results in both the U.S. and outside the U.S.","Now reviewing sales for our major therapeutic areas. Immunology products achieved strong double-digit operational sales growth of 20.5%. Growth in the U.S. of 1.2% was impacted by lower export sales to Merck. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2011 as a result of the agreement reached with Merck, we began selling REMICADE and SIMPONI directly into certain international territories. We therefore recorded lower export sales related to those territories and higher international sales. Excluding the change in export sales, U.S. immunology sales increased over 13% led by STELARA, up 22.9%; SIMPONI, up 20.8%; and REMICADE, up 11.9%. With these strong results, we expanded our U.S. market leadership in immunology.","International sales of immunology products tripled versus the first quarter of 2011 due primarily to the sales related to the territories we regained from Merck, complemented by the very strong growth of STELARA. Sales of infectious disease products declined 17% on an operational basis. Excluding the generic impact of LEVAQUIN, which I previously mentioned, infectious disease sales increased over 40%. Major contributors were the successful launch of INCIVO for hepatitis C, the continued momentum in market share growth for PREZISTA for HIV and additional sales of vaccines related to the February 2011 acquisition of Crucell. INCIVO contributed nearly 5 points of the growth to the total international Pharmaceutical sales results. ","Neuroscience product sales decreased 4.3% on an operational basis impacted by generic competition with CONCERTA, as I mentioned, as well as products such as RISPERDAL, TOPAMAX and RAZADYNE. The long-acting injectable antipsychotics RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA achieved double-digit operational growth due to an increase in combined market share. Sales of oncology products increased 38.5% on an operational basis due to the very strong results for ZYTIGA and VELCADE, partially offset by lower sales of DOXIL\/CAELYX related to manufacturing issues at our third-party supplier. ZYTIGA is currently approved to treat chemo refractory metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved sales of $200 million split evenly between the U.S. and outside the U.S. On a sequential basis, reported sales increased approximately 30%. VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma, for which we have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world outside the U.S. Operational sales grew 29.3% due to the timing of tender business and strong growth in use in the frontline setting. ","DOXIL\/CAELYX declined over 80% on an operational basis in the quarter. As we previously discussed, based on the update last December from our third-party manufacturer about its estimated time frame for restoring manufacturing operations, we do not anticipate DOXIL\/CAELYX to be available until late 2012. Restoring a reliable supply of DOXIL\/CAELYX remains our most urgent priority. We continue to pursue a variety of options to bring a consistent supply of DOXIL\/CAELYX back to patients and physicians as quickly as possible. In addition to longer-term solutions, we are pursuing a shorter-term option to restore supply ahead of the late 2012 time frame. Other Pharmaceutical products declined 7.9% on an operational basis due primarily to divestitures and lower sales of ACIPHEX\/PARIET and EPREX due to the impact of generic competition. ","I'll now review the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment sales of $6.4 billion grew 0.5% operationally as compared to the same period in 2011. Currency had a negative impact of 0.8 points resulting in a total sales decrease of 0.3%. Sales in U.S. were up 0.2%, while sales outside U.S. increased on an operational basis by 0.7%. Excluding drug-eluting stents, worldwide sales increased approximately 2% on an operational basis. ","Now turning to the MD&D businesses, starting with cardiovascular care. Cardiovascular care sales were down 23.5% operationally, with U.S. down 27.3% and sales outside U.S. down 21.2% operationally. The decision in the second quarter of 2011 to exit the drug-eluting stent market and the decline in market share for endovascular stents negatively impacted sales this quarter. This was partially offset by strong sales for Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, which achieved operational growth of 12% in the quarter. The impact on disposables utilization due to the breadth of the installed base of CARTO 3, complemented by the success of the new THERMOCOOL catheter launches made strong contributions to the results. ","The diabetes care business achieved operational sales growth of 6.6% in the first quarter of 2012 with the U.S. business up 13.2% due to new product launches and favorable mix. The business outside U.S. grew 0.2% operationally, with strong sales in the emerging markets offset by pricing pressures in some of the developed markets. The diagnostics business declined 1.1% on an operational basis in the first quarter. Sales in the U.S. were down 4.5% due to lower donor screening sales due to competitive pressures and the implementation of selected testing guidelines for Chagas' disease. Sales outside the U.S. were up 2.5% operationally, driven by the continued adoption of the VITROS platforms. General surgery worldwide sales grew operationally by 1.4% with the U.S. down 0.5% and sales outside U.S. up 2.6% operationally.","The success of the new product launches SECURESTRAP and ECHELON FLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler were partially offset by lower sales of mechanical products due to the continued shift to minimally invasive procedures and low-cost competition and lower sales of pelvic floor repair products. Infection prevention grew 13.4% on an operational basis, with U.S. growth at 22.1% and growth outside the U.S. of 6.5% on an operational basis. Growth was driven by increased market share due to the larger installed base of STERRAD systems. Orthopedic sales were flat when compared to the same period in 2011. Sales in the U.S. were down 3.5% due to the impact of the divestiture in December 2011 of surgical instruments and continued pricing pressure partially offset by positive mix. The orthopedics business outside the U.S. grew by 4.1% operationally due primarily to strong growth in Asia. ","Operationally, hips were up 1% worldwide, driven by 3% growth outside the U.S. attributed to heads, cementless stems and acetabular products. In the U.S., hips were essentially flat. Knees worldwide increased 2% on an operational basis, with U.S. up 2% and operational sales outside U.S. up 1%. Worldwide spine was down 3% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 8% due to continued pressure on price. Sales outside the U.S. were up 5% operationally. Specialty surgery achieved operational growth of 9.9% in the first quarter of 2012, with the U.S. sales up 10.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 9.3% on an operational basis. Incremental sales from the acquisition of SterilMed, strong sales of biosurgery products and new product launches were the major drivers of growth this quarter. ","Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care business achieved operational sales growth of 4.5% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 8.2%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6% on an operational basis. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses. That completes highlights for the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2012. ","Before I turn the call over to Dominic, I would like to discuss the Arkansas judge's decision last week regarding RISPERDAL, awarding $1.2 billion in penalties against the company. Many of you have asked about this matter, so I would like to provide the following context. During the entire period at question, Arkansas Medicaid spent a total of less than $10 million of state funds on prescriptions for RISPERDAL. The state acknowledged that RISPERDAL was a very important therapy for patients and that the state did not intend to interfere with physicians prescribing RISPERDAL to treat their patients. We firmly believe the imposition of the penalties was excessive, not justified by the evidence presented at trial and will not be upheld on appeal. If our motion for a new trial is denied, we will appeal. The company has not established an accrual with respect to the judgment. We continue to stand fully behind RISPERDAL, which helps millions of patients around the world who suffer from the debilitating effects of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. I will now turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?","Dominic J. Caruso","Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone. I would like to provide some comments this morning about our first quarter results, highlight some recent business and pipeline developments and provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2012. There continues to be multiple external factors that have resulted in significant headwinds, such as the macroeconomic conditions, governmental budgetary actions and regulatory and industry trends. However, we continue to see significant opportunities in health care, and we are well positioned as a global leader to capitalize on these opportunities based on the strength of our recently launched products, our robust and advancing pipelines and our broad base in health care.","We're off to a good start in 2012. Given the impact of LEVAQUIN and CONCERTA going generic in mid-2011, we expected and we saw modest operational sales growth in the first quarter. Although utilization in the health care markets continues to be below prerecession levels, we are seeing a continuation of stabilization, and we are encouraged by recent fourth quarter utilization data, which was modestly positive. In particular, we saw U.S.-based hospital surgical procedures modestly grow, which is the first time we saw this in the data in the last 9 quarters. We also are seeing continued progress with our new product launches and our sales in emerging markets. ","Our Pharmaceutical business operational growth this quarter was approximately 3%, reflecting the tough comparisons from the impact of LEVAQUIN and CONCERTA. Excluding both the generic impacts and the positive impact from our agreement with Merck last year to regain certain international sales territories for REMICADE and SIMPONI, Pharmaceutical sales for the first quarter would have increased approximately 9% operationally, reflecting the success of the new product launches, as well as continued growth in many of our core products. Our Medical Device businesses saw modest operational growth in the first quarter, driven by our decision to exit the drug-eluting stent market in the second quarter of 2011. Our MD&D businesses, however, continue to be market leaders, with either #1 or #2 market positions in 17 of our 19 key platforms. And our Consumer business showed modest operational decline in first quarter performance due primarily to lower production levels of our McNeil U.S. over-the-counter products as a result of the work required under the Consent Decree.","As to earnings, we are very pleased to have reported solid earnings per share in the first quarter of $1.37, excluding special items. During the first quarter, we completed the divestiture of the high blood pressure drug, Bystolic, to Forest Laboratories for a one-time cash payment of $357 million. The gain from that transaction, which we expected when we provided guidance in January, is reflected in our first quarter results. We also continue to make investments this past quarter to advance our robust pipelines, launch new products and implement remediation plans for our manufacturing and quality systems at our McNeil Consumer Healthcare business. ","Now let's take a look at some first quarter 2012 accomplishments across our businesses. First, in our Pharmaceutical business. Based on the unanimous recommendation of the investigational drug monitoring committee, we unblinded the Phase III study of ZYTIGA for the treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had not received chemotherapy. Based on the study results, we plan to submit for regulatory approval of ZYTIGA for these indications in the United States and Europe in the second half of 2012. We announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted priority review for XARELTO to reduce the risk of blood clots in patients with acute coronary syndrome, which we had filed at the end of 2011. XARELTO is already approved in the U.S. for the prevention of blood clots following hip and knee replacement surgery and the prevention of stroke as a result of blood clots.","And we also announced the results of the EINSTEIN-PE study showing that the oral anticoagulant XARELTO was comparable to today's standard of care in treating patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism and in preventing the development of a secondary venous blood clot known as venous thromboembolism or VTE. The study found that XARELTO had a similar safety profile and significantly lower risk of major bleeding versus the current standard of care regimen. The data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we plan to file the EINSTEIN studies in a supplemental new drug application with the FDA during the second quarter for an indication in the VTE treatment.","The FDA approved the use of INTELENCE to be administered in combination with antiviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 in treatment-experienced pediatric patients. And finally, with respect to Bapineuzumab, we have agreed with our partner Pfizer to present the results from the 2 North American Phase III studies which we led, study 301 and study 302, later this year. Based on standard practices for both companies, we will ensure the data are presented in a timely manner at an appropriate scientific venue.","Our MD&D business also continued to make important advancements. In February, we received an approvable letter from the FDA on our SEDASYS system, the first computer-assisted personalized sedation system. We are pleased to have reached this milestone in our efforts to bring this important innovation closer to market as we believe the SEDASYS system has the potential to benefit patients and health care providers. LifeScan launched in the U.S. the OneTouch Verio IQ system with PatternAlert Technology, the first and only blood glucose meter to look for patterns of high and low blood sugar levels and alert diabetes patients with detailed messages onscreen, alerting them to changes in their blood sugar levels. The system is in the process of being launched globally. Approximately 366 million people globally are expected to have diabetes by the year 2030 and about 26 million Americans live with diabetes today.","And in our Consumer Healthcare business, several McNeil products have returned to the market and more are planned to return throughout this year and next. However, it is difficult to predict the speed of recovery while operating under the Consent Decree. Therefore, we do not anticipate our U.S. OTC business to be a driver of growth this year. We continue making progress on our commitments under the Consent Decree, and we are experiencing higher remediation costs as a result. All of these impacts are considered in our guidance, which I will discuss in just a minute. Meanwhile, our skin care business continues to be a solid contributor of growth with our Neutrogena business bringing new innovations to market and the ongoing success of our Neutrogena Naturals moisturizer and night cream. ","Now I'd like to provide an update on the status of our pending acquisition of Synthes. We continue to make good progress on all aspects of the acquisition planning process and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2012. The merger agreement requires regulatory clearance from 5 markets prior to closing. We have received clearance from 3 of those markets: Japan, Canada and China. We are actively working with the other 2: the EU and the U.S. regulatory authorities. Earlier this month, we received a binding offer from Biomet, Inc. to acquire the DePuy Orthopaedics trauma business. The offer includes the purchase of DePuy's internal and external fixation products used in the treatment of bone fractures, as well as the organization supporting this business. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012. We believe this divestiture will satisfy all regulatory concerns relating to the pending acquisition of Synthes, but we will not know with certainty until the regulatory processes in the EU and the U.S. are completed.","Let me now provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2012. My comments do not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Synthes. As we would normally do, we will update our guidance once the acquisition is completed. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense.","At the end of the first quarter, we had over $14 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $33 billion of cash and investments and approximately $19 billion of debt. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions during 2012, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $500 million and $550 million. This is consistent with our previous guidance.","Turning to other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation and divestitures, asset sales or write-offs. As we previously noted in our guidance for 2012, we had expected a gain from a divestiture in early 2012 and, in fact, that gain is reflected in our first quarter results. This account is difficult to forecast. But assuming no additional major one-time gains or losses and excluding the impact of any special items, I would recommend you consider modeling other income and expense for 2012 as a net gain, ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, consistent with our previous guidance.","And now a word on taxes. For the first 3 months of 2012, the company's effective tax rate, excluding special items was 22.8%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2012 in the range of 21% to 22% consistent with our previous guidance. Although not yet reflected in our first quarter results, this annual tax rate assumes that the R&D tax credit will be reinstated by Congress by the end of this year. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year.","Now let's turn to sales and earnings guidance. Our guidance continues to be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations, assuming that average currency rates for 2012 will be the same as they were for 2011. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this operational view provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also continue to provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2012 with the impact that current exchange rates could have, using the euro as an example. ","Now turning to sales. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between approximately 4% and 5% for the year. This is consistent with our previous guidance. This would result in estimated sales for 2012 on a constant currency basis of approximately $68 billion. While we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact, if currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2012 were to stay where they were as of last week, as an example, with the euro at approximately $1.31, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 2% for the year. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 2% and 3% for the year for an expected level of reported sales of approximately $66.5 billion, slightly higher than our previous guidance due to the strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar.","And now turning to earnings. I suggest that you consider full year 2012 operational EPS estimates of between $5.18 and $5.28 per share, excluding the impact of special items and assuming the same average exchange rates for 2012 as we saw in 2011. This is consistent with our previous guidance. And while we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for the balance of 2012 were to remain where they were as of last week, then the impact of currency movements, primarily the euro, would be a reduction of approximately $0.11 per share. Therefore, our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be between $5.07 and $5.17 per share for a reported EPS growth rate of approximately 1.5% to 3.5%, which is slightly higher than our previously guidance, reflecting the strength of foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. ","That concludes my comments on our operating performance this quarter and our guidance with respect to your models. And now, Louise, back to you for the Q&A.","Louise Mehrotra","Thanks, Dominic. Keela, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the first quarter operational growth was 1%, Dominic. The guidance is 4% to 5%, if I heard correctly. Could you talk a little bit about what accelerates growth going forward, especially in Q2, given that if we look at the operational growth rate in the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year, there does seem to have been a deceleration?","Dominic J. Caruso","Right. Well, I guess, Larry, the main factor in the growth rate comparison has to do with LEVAQUIN and CONCERTA. The first quarter, as we mentioned, for the Pharmaceutical business, only at 3% reflects the fact that LEVAQUIN went generic in May or June of 2011, and obviously we entered into that agreement with Watson for authorized generic of CONCERTA in May of 2011. So in the first quarter of 2011, we didn't have those impacts yet so that's the major reason for the comparison. As we progress through the year, those comparisons will be easier. Of course, the comps will be easier. And just as a reminder, we did acquire the Crucell business very late in the first quarter of 2011. So if you look at the entire business and you just exclude the things that I mentioned, sort of generic impacts, the impact of drug-eluting stents that Louise mentioned and also the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which netted to be actually a minor amount, the overall growth rate for our business in the first quarter on an operational basis is just about 4%. So we feel pretty confident that we'll accelerate the growth for the remainder of the year.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Dominic, just one on DePuy and the orthopedic market. It looks like there was some improvement in the U.S. in knees. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing overall in the orthopedic market from a procedure and pricing standpoint, please?","Dominic J. Caruso","Sure, sure. And I'll ask Louise to comment as well if I leave anything out. We did see some improvement in knees. And we continue to see knees being positively affected by product mix. So overall, in our knee business, pricing is only slightly negative, very, very low, not even quite single-digit price, offset by positive mix that's low-single digits. So that's a boost in the knee business. And overall, the knee market seems to be recovering as well. And Louise, anything else you want to add to that?","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. So the commentary we got from DePuy said that they are seeing early signs of some positive trends in the knee market. However, we won't know for sure until all the other manufacturers report.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dominic, just first question on your guidance. You had commented on the fourth quarter call that you expected pretax operating margins for the year to improve by 100 to 150 basis points. I think they were up about 10 basis points this quarter. So does that 100 to 150 basis points for the year still stand?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, it does, Mike. We feel pretty confident about that moving through the rest of the year.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Let me ask then a couple of operational questions. The commentary around the Consumer business, particularly McNeil, suggested that it was going to take a little bit longer to get some of those issues resolved. I think you talked in your prepared remarks about the volumes coming out of Las Piedras and Fort Washington and Lancaster, but Fort Washington being offline, I think you said, until late 2013 and then Las Piedras and Lancaster being -- ramping all the way in through most of '13. That sounded like it was a longer time period recovery for McNeil than we have been previously thinking about.","Dominic J. Caruso","It is, Mike. As I said in my remarks, operating under the Consent Decree, it's difficult to predict the rate of recovery. And although we're making progress and we are operating under a Consent Decree in close cooperation with our third-party consultant who's there with us, it is difficult to accurately predict the speed of recovery. And as such, we are, in fact, behind where we felt we might be at this point. And we expect a slower recovery throughout the year than we previously thought at the tail end of last year. Although products are coming back to the market, they'll continue to come back to the market throughout the year. You'll see more and more of the products back on the shelves, but it will extend into 2013 as well. And as I mentioned earlier, we're also incurring some additional remediation costs as a result of the delays. But all of that has already been factored into the guidance I just provided.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just one question on ZYTIGA. When the independent data monitoring committee stopped the Phase III trial in pre-chemo metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients, they did so based on the primary end point, which was progression-free survival. And I believe it was based on data that went through late last year. Do you know if at ASCO if we'll see the follow-up on patients up through the actual announcement of the halting of the trial, where the question here is whether we'll see overall survival reach potential significance at the full follow-up?","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. So you're correct, Mike, it did include the information up until the end of last year. I think it was November of last year. I don't believe that you're going to see the continuing trend on the overall survival at ASCO. You'll see the results as we have them right now.","Operator","The next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dominic, just a clarification on the other income line. You reported $611 million, some of that was related to Synthes and foreign exchange, which we excluded, but some of that was related to divestitures which you included in operating income. Can you update us on where your expectations are for additional divestitures throughout the year? I think that during the previous call you had indicated between $500 million to $600 million. But I just wanted to make sure that I was thinking about that correctly. And then secondly, back on the OTC question, clearly the Consent Decree has slowed the process down. How do you feel about a recovery story in 2013? And once the products reach the market, what are your expectations in terms of how much market share you think you can gain back?","Dominic J. Caruso","Okay. Well, on the divestitures, Jami, let me try to do a little bit better job of explaining what's in that other income and expense line. Typically, that line includes royalty income, which is in the $500 million -- these are pretax numbers. $500 million of royalty income, and then there's roughly another $100 million of other activity that flows through that line. We did expect, as we mentioned, a divestiture to occur early this year, which it did. And that divestiture, as I mentioned earlier, had proceeds of around $350 million. So our current guidance, which is the same as it was in January is for that line item, other income and expense, to be between $900 million and $1 billion. So it factors in the normal run rate that I just mentioned of $500 million to $600 million and this divestiture that we just completed in the first quarter, so hopefully that's clear. And then with respect to the divestiture income, I just wanted to point out that these are taxed at various rates because they occur at various tax jurisdictions. Both the divestiture in 2012, as well as the divestitures that were in the gains in 2011, which included not only a divestiture but an equity gain with respect to our acquisition of Crucell, on an after-tax basis, they're very comparable. They're in the $200 million range both on an after-tax basis. And then with respect to recovery in 2013 and ultimate share recapture, we still feel very confident about our ability to recapture share. We're obviously disappointed that it's taking a little longer to get back into the market. But all indicators of the equity scores that we track with respect to the brands, children's TYLENOL, even adult TYLENOL, continue to show that the brands, both TYLENOL and MOTRIN and especially children's products, continued to score very highly compared to store brands even though they're not available on the shelf, and so much so that the scores are in the neighborhood of 2 to 3x the level of trust and confidence in the brand compared to the current available brands, particularly store brands. So that gives us great confidence that the significant legacy that has been built with these brands over the years still remains with consumers, and they'll accept the products back once we get them back on the shelf in a continuous way.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just -- so I\u2019m clear on timing, Dominic, I think earlier in the year or late last year, you had said you expected most products to be back on the market by mid-2012, and then that became later 2012 to spilling into 2013. And now it's today's news that, that 2013 will -- the recovery will continue more into 2013, is that correct?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. I would say the way to think about it is that probably half of the products will get back into the market in 2012 and the remaining half in 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Dodds of Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to start off by wondering why the lost sales were soft in the U.S. That's a little concerning. No, actually, just don't count it as my question. For Dominic, on the gross margin. Can you say generally because of the generic impacts, do you expect that number to move up throughout the year? Is this the low point for 2012?","Dominic J. Caruso","Actually, no. I think that with the continuation of the remediation that we talked about with the McNeil Consumer business and the fact that we now have the Crucell business in the full year, we would expect gross margin to not be at the low point now and actually be under a little pressure for the remainder of the year. And actually looking at all your models, I noticed that you had -- many of you have that pretty well-pegged as a lower gross margin this year versus last year. So obviously, the improvement in pretax operating margins that we referred to before on Mike's question is going to come mostly from SG&A and a little bit lower R&D spend.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So most of the remediation costs are in COGS and not in SG&A?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, that's correct. Yes, that's correct.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then one more question. On the general surgery business, it looks like it slid from prior performance. So I was wondering in sutures, endomechanical, hernia, did anything in that business fall off in the quarter?","Dominic J. Caruso","Louise has that data right in front of her. Go ahead, Louise.","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. So sutures were up about 0.5% in the quarter. Mechanical was down about 3% and we saw a large decline in the pelvic floor area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajeev Jashnani of UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In our model, with Synthes closing in a couple of months, we've attempted to include this and a major assumption we've got is the level of share repurchase that J&J could do after that deal closes. I was just wondering if you could share a little bit about your thinking regarding share repurchase following Synthes, and perhaps touch on what the appetitive ability to do so is, given litigation and everything else.","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. Rajeev, I'm not going to comment specifically about share repurchases. But I will remind you and everyone else that when we spoke about the Synthes transaction, obviously we modeled it in the most conservative way. And we said we would be working to try to finance the transaction in a more efficient manner. We're still exploring all those opportunities and alternatives. We're making good progress, but we're not able to really comment on that until very close and probably at the time of closure, at which point we'll give you a full picture on how the transaction is being structured differently from the way it was announced, if it is in fact differently structured. So other than that, I can't give you any more comments at this point.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I'll maybe push my luck a little bit, anyway, and say, could we think of it as being funded operationally or perhaps through the balance sheet?","Dominic J. Caruso","I think we just have to wait and get all the regulatory approvals in line and then the various alternatives we have considered will then be clear for us. And then we'll move forward on that basis. So it will be premature to comment any further now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Sanderson of Cowen and Company.","Ian Sanderson - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First, on the RISPERDAL litigation, just a quick follow-up. When might we hear if whether your motion for dismissal has been accepted?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, I guess I don't have a good estimate of that. We're going to -- we\u2019ve filed or will be filing that. And then as Louise mentioned, if it's not accepted, we intend to appeal.","Ian Sanderson - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, on the Synthes closing, is the review deadline, the EU review deadline, still effectively April 26? And has the U.S. FTC set any formal review deadline?","Dominic J. Caruso","So the EU has posted on their website April 26, and we're not aware of any changes to that. And the U.S. has not established a review deadline.","Ian Sanderson - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, Louise, could you give us some idea of the XARELTO sales in the quarter?","Louise Mehrotra","It's a little early to do that, Ian, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Sara Michelmore, Brean Murray.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on XARELTO, Louise. Can you just give an update in terms of formulary coverage and things like that for the product at this point?","Louise Mehrotra","So XARELTO is on about 90% of the formularies. It's in either a Tier 1 -- or sorry, Tier 2 or Tier 3. So for commercialized, it's over 90% coverage, about 40% is Tier 2 and about the remaining 50% is Tier 3. And Part D, 90% coverage and 2\/3 is on the preferred tier.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, Dominic, the Consumer business, I know there is a lot of moving parts in addition to the OTC stuff, that you've got a bunch of divestitures and acquisitions flowing through there, but is there any way to give us a sense of what you think the underlying growth of that business is if we can clear out the noise? And in terms of the trend, would you say it's the same, better or worse compared to what it was doing in 2011?","Dominic J. Caruso","Right. Okay. Well, with respect to the Consumer business and the divestitures and acquisitions, just to give you a quick summary of that, they actually net out to have very little impact this quarter because remember, we had some divestitures of MONISTAT and other brands, but we also acquired DOKTOR MOM and other brands. So overall, that 0.6% decline operationally nets out to be about 0.5% decline operationally, net of all the ins and outs. So that's not a major factor in the quarter. We did see some slowdown in the Asia Pacific region and particularly China. China had some issues with ingredients that had been well-publicized that are not new issues, just another recurrence of some issues there in China, that slowed down the growth in that region of the world. And we continue to see store brands, obviously, take share and hold on to share. I would say that the skin care business, which is where we're demonstrating most of the innovation in our Consumer business continues to show very positive growth and continues to do very well, so very pleased with that. So overall, flattish performance in the quarter is a little bit lower than it was coming out of last year. But principally due to the fact that we haven't had the recovery yet that we expected and a little bit slower growth in the China market.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. If I could sneak one more in on SEDASYS. What's left to do there in terms of getting that product finally cleared and ready to launch?","Dominic J. Caruso","Right. So we've got to complete the response letter, and obviously, we have an approvable letter. And we need to respond to the requirements of the approvable letter. And they're mostly things involving training of utilization of the product, and then sort of postmarket observance and those sorts of things. So we want to get that lined up and get it ready for launch in the appropriate way after we respond to the FDA's questions. But no new clinical studies required for approval, for example, just a follow-up to the data we had previously provided and some development of training materials and the like.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups on some of the questions that have been asked here. First, on the lines of the income statement, the gross margin below our estimate, you mentioned the remediation costs. Is this the right margin level for the rest of the year? Do you get any leverage on the spending component throughout the year? Or does that continue to ramp, kind of hold it in this range?","Dominic J. Caruso","Matt, I think with our new outlook for remediation cost being slightly higher than we previously mentioned, I think that we're going to see gross margin be under pressure for the remainder of the year. I think I answered that question earlier when Matt Dodds asked it. So I don't think there's going to be significant leverage in that line this year. Remember that this year, we also said we expected significant pricing issues in the business. And we're seeing that, stronger declines in pricing than we saw the previous year. And all of that, including the increased remediation costs, are now reflected in the updated guidance, which although it's consistent essentially with previous guidance, takes into consideration these more negative factors, offset by the fact that the rest of the business is off to a good start.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And the R&D line, you also mentioned these delayed milestone payments, hoping that I didn't miss somebody else asking the same question, that could we expect those to catch up in the next couple of quarters or by the end of the year? Is that the thinking on R&D?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. So I think R&D will be a little higher in future quarters and it has to do with not necessarily delayed milestone payments, just the timing of milestone payments under various agreements that we have. Wherein previous quarter, we would have had milestone payments under contract, in this quarter, no such significant milestone payments were due. So I don't want you to think there's any delays in the program. It's just timing of when the programs and our milestone payments kick in. So that will go up a little bit throughout the year.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful. And then on ortho, to follow up on some of your comments there and the questions that were asked earlier in your prepared remarks. The mix, did you mention which products are driving that on the knee side? Is TRUMATCH a factor there? Any other commentary that you got from DePuy?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, go ahead, Louise.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. So some of the mix is being driven by the revision segment.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, revisions. And Dominic's comments, last one, on the utilization trends. I just wasn't clear, you mentioned Q4, and then you also mentioned some improving trends in surgical volumes. I just -- are you seeing that in the first quarter? Or is that Q4 data? Just the timing of that will be helpful.","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. The data I was referring to was Q4 data. We don't really feel that the Q1 data is that reliable this early. But we have pretty good data on Q4. And we saw across all segments of utilization, whether at the hospital surgical procedures, ambulatory procedures, physician visits, lab procedures, et cetera, all positive signs. Although modest, I will say, positive signs so that's what I meant by we were encouraged by the Q4 data.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And just making sure that we're not reading that as maybe -- is this something that you saw on Q4 last year or different than you saw in Q4 last year? Is the seasonality a factor? Or how should we look at that?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. Well, the way we looked at it, Matt, is it's the first time, for example, for hospital surgical procedures, it's the first quarter in 9 quarters that we saw a quarter-to-quarter uptick in surgical procedures.","Operator","The next question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So following on the utilization conversation, your comments there have been focused on the U.S. I was wondering if you could turn to Europe and give us some color on what you're seeing in utilization there, first off. I noticed that in the Medical Devices division, you did see a deceleration in your international sales from 4.6% to 0.7% operationally. Is any utilization coming to there? And then any other just further commentary on Europe receivables that you might be seeing there in pharma austerity?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. Well, with utilization -- the data in Europe\u2019s obviously more difficult to nail down than it is in the U.S. Most of the FX that we saw in MD&D in Europe have to do with exiting the drug-eluting stent business so that's really the primary driver of the international dropoff that you're referring to. The austerity measures, we did expect and are seeing a little bit higher level of basically pricing, negative pricing in the businesses, both Pharma and MD&D, as we expected when we set guidance for the year. So we're seeing a continuation of that as playing out as we thought at a bit higher level than we saw in the previous year. And then finally, with respect to receivables in Europe, we're monitoring that very closely. We think we have a pretty good handle on it. And we are seeing some slight increase in the aging of those receivables, but nothing that we don't have a good handle on right now, nothing that we're particularly concerned about at the moment. But we'll obviously continue to monitor it and put appropriate actions in place.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And did you see an extra selling day in the quarter from the leap day? And if so, can you talk about the impact that, that had on the various growth rates for your divisions?","Louise Mehrotra","Actually, for our business, it was actually one less selling day because we work on a 4-4-5 basis. But we're not a calendar year, but it had no to minimal effect.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Wise of Leerink Swann.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Let me touch on the announced management changes, Dominic. Maybe just -- this is the first opportunity we've had sort of publicly to hear your reflections on this. I'd be curious to hear why the timing now -- I mean, obviously Alex is not here to express for himself. But can we -- should we expect anything different under his leadership? Is there any reason that choice is made? And maybe talk a little about Sheri's departure. I know J&J has an incredibly deep bench, but obviously a very talented executive. What's your perspective on that?","Dominic J. Caruso","Right. Well, obviously, the decision on selecting the next CEO is the board's decision. So I'm not at liberty to comment on the board's rationale. We're obviously very pleased that Alex is going to be our new CEO. He officially takes over on April 26, which is the date of our annual shareholders' meeting. He will take over the CEO role from Bill Weldon at that point. And as you probably all know, Bill will remain as Chairman of our board. You're absolutely right that we do have a deep bench, and Sheri is and was a very valued member of our company and a very strong contributor to the success of Johnson & Johnson over the years. But of course, Sheri decided to pursue another opportunity at a very high senior level in another publicly traded company. So we obviously wish her well. I would say in terms of major changes, our business and our philosophy has been tried and true. Our business has run under a philosophy that's been tried and true for many years. And Alex, as you know, has been with our company for many years and even left and came back to our company. So he has seen other companies in operation as well. I would say that our core principles of managing for the long term, of our decentralized management philosophy being broadly based in human health care, and most importantly, the value system that's embodied in our credo, I certainly don't expect to see any changes there. These are the core principles in which our business has been operated under for many, many years, and obviously, the underpinning of our success. So we\u2019re looking forward to Alex taking over on April 26. And I personally look forward to working closely with Alex to continue the success of our company.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Let me turn to pretax operating margins. You'd said in the fourth quarter, and I'm hearing some of the nuanced changes today, that you expected every line, R&D, cost of goods, selling and marketing, to improve. You expect gross margins to improve. But you said basically, bottom line, we expect pretax operating margins to improve by 100 to 150 bps in 2012. I just want to be clear. Do you still expect that? And if you do, with a little more cautious guidance on gross margins, how do we think about the SG&A and R&D lines? It sounds like both would have to be lower to hit that range.","Dominic J. Caruso","Right. Well, of course, it's a range, right? So 100 to 150 basis points. We do feel comfortable that with our new outlook for the year, we'll still be able to achieve that in 2012 across each of the lines. I think that, overall, the cost of products sold line will be slightly lower than it was in 2011 at the end, although it will get slightly worse throughout this year. So hopefully, I didn't confuse you when I mentioned that earlier. We do still expect to see improvement across all lines in the P&L. And throughout the year, we may see a slight dip in gross margin with the remediation cost. But overall, we do expect it to end up being slightly lower than it was the prior year. And certainly, we're comfortable with that range of 100 to 150 basis points overall.","Operator","The next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just have a couple of quick ones. Can you provide an update on Canagliflozin?","Dominic J. Caruso","Sure. So that product we expect to file, Louise, relatively shortly now in the second quarter for type 2 diabetes. So we're very pleased there. And I don't know what else I could tell you. We're going to file pretty soon.","Louise Mehrotra","And we plan to show some data at ADA. So it's all on target, U.S., EU filing, second quarter.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then within the specialty surgery business, you did include the acquisition of SterilMed. Can you maybe just help us kind of parse out what the acquisition contribution was?","Louise Mehrotra","So if you exclude SterilMed from specialty surgery -- so specialty surgery grew 10%, 9.9% operationally -- it would be about 6%, excluding SterilMed.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then within orthopedics, I just kind of want to understand your comments again. Not to beat a dead horse, but operational growth this quarter was flat. It was kind of flat in the fourth quarter. It sounds like you guys were a little bit more optimistic. Hips grew about the same, knees were a little better, spine was a little -- pretty much the same as fourth quarter. So what kind of, I guess, offsets some of the better performance of the knees?","Dominic J. Caruso","You said -- was your question what was the negative impact that offsets some of the better performance in knees to result in flat? Well, what we saw is a little bit worse pricing actually in the spine market. So pricing was in the mid-single digits. And it looked like it got a little bit worse in the first quarter of 2012.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And any trends that you're seeing within kind of the spine and trauma market changed the way you're generally looking at the benefits of the Synthes acquisition?","Dominic J. Caruso","No, not really. I think we do these acquisitions with a long-term view. And as you remember, the acquisition had many positive strategic benefits, most notably, the ability to enter the emerging markets with hip and knee platforms as a result of having a strong presence in the trauma market, which is essentially the major driver of orthopedic activity in those markets so that still remains the same. And obviously, Synthes, as you know, is a very innovative and well-run company. So we're pleased to be able to welcome them shortly into the family of companies.","Louise Mehrotra","And one thing, Kristen, we did divest the surgery business, the DePuy neurosurgery instruments, in the fourth quarter. If you took that out, we actually would have grown about 1% so that's something that's different in the first quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Hopkins of BofA.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So 2 questions. First, on your comments on Bapi. I was wondering if you could help us understand which medical meetings are candidates for the data release. I assume you still want to show both data sets together, and that probably eliminates the July meetings. But is there -- are there 1 or 2 or 3 meetings that are most likely candidates for this data release this fall?","Louise Mehrotra","Bob, we're not going to comment on that, but it will be sometime this year.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Sometime 2012, okay. And then to talk about your comments on utilization, I understand those were fourth quarter comments. And then you mentioned that your endomechanical business is down 3% in the first quarter. Any commentary from the division level in terms of how is that trending in endomechanical? Is that a step-down? Is there a reason why, do you think that's market, market share? I'm just trying to reconcile your comments about feeling a little better about procedures to the endomechanical number that you showed this particular quarter.","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. So it's primarily in the mechanical business, and it's to do with low-cost competition, as well as the move to minimally invasive surgeries.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But still feeling pretty good about the general trends here in the first quarter? Or you're not making any comments about new utilization trends in Q1, just in Q4?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes. I think the only thing, Bob, that we can look at with some confidence in the data is the Q4 data. So obviously, we'll update you throughout the year and let you know what we see. But it's too early to comment on first quarter data.","Operator","Our next question is from Tony Butler of Barclays.","Alison Yang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Alison Yang calling in on behalf of Tony. A couple of product questions. First of all, congratulations on ZYTIGA, $200 million in the quarter. That's 2\/3 of last year already in the first quarter. Can you discuss what percent of the indication is in the post-chemo? Is there any off-label use in chemo-naive? Could you give us a sense of what's the opportunity size in the chemo-naive segment? If it\u2019s bigger than post-chemo, then how much bigger? My second question is another pharma product, INCIVO. We estimate, based on your comment about 5% growth o U.S., that the sales is about $130 million. Could you discuss how many European markets your product is in place? And what is the maturity of the pricing reimbursement discussion in the European markets?","Dominic J. Caruso","Well, Alison, that was -- we'll try to parse through that. Look, we're extremely pleased with ZYTIGA, so thanks for noticing that. The product is doing well, and most importantly, it's actually helping patients. I do think that the chemo-naive market is a bigger market for the product. We don't have that indication yet. We're not certain, but there -- of course, physicians are free to prescribe it to their patients. Of course, we're not promoting it in the chemo-naive population, so there may be some off-label use by physicians in that part of the market. But we do think that once we get the indication, we'll see further penetration of ZYTIGA into the overall patient population. I think your comment about INCIVO, the math is pretty good there. They contributed about 5% of the international growth so that gets you about the number, that $130 million number. So we're pleased with the first results on INCIVO as well. And Louise, you have other points to add to that?","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. So the question on the countries where it's launched, it's Germany, France, the Alpine countries, Nordics, Iberia, U.K. and Israel. And then the pricing discussions, they're still ongoing, but it's in the range of about EUR 25,000 per course.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 follow-up questions on the U.S. spine number in the quarter, down 8%. Do you think you were down with the market? Or did you lose market share? And then my second question is on price. Dominic, you said pricing got a little bit worse, but I thought in 4Q, you said pricing was down mid-single digits as well. So did price go from maybe down 4 in 4Q down to 5? Any additional color on pricing would be great.","Dominic J. Caruso","Well, on share, it's too early for us to comment until we see the results from other folks. I should have added that the overall, little bit further decline in price was a factor of mix. So actually the overall price decline in the first quarter of '12 was comparable to the fourth quarter of '11 at mid-single digits, but we saw a little bit worse product mix impact in Q1 2012 that we saw compared to the fourth quarter of '11, and that made the overall comparison, price\/mix comparison, a little worse in the first quarter of '12. Hopefully, that's clearer now.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great. Can I just ask one quick follow-up on utilization? Do you feel like spine utilization is any better? Is payer pushback subsiding? Any color on utilization would be great.","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, I think overall, utilization is starting to stabilize, meaning that we're not seeing the rapid declines that we saw and the continual declines, and the data that I mentioned earlier overall in procedure volumes was encouraging. Although I must say, it's modest and it's really just one quarter. So we're happy to see a turn, but it is one data point, so we'll have to wait and see how it plays out in the future quarters. So I wouldn't read too much into it just this early in the year.","Operator","The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dominic, just one quick question here on R&D. Seasonally, this quarter is always a kind of a low R&D quarter and it builds throughout the year. This is a little lower than the year-on period. I guess, maybe just talk to us about this. Is there anything structural we should be thinking about in terms of where that R&D came into the first quarter? Or should we just simply believe that R&D is going to build throughout the remainder of the year?","Dominic J. Caruso","Yes, there isn't anything structural. R&D will build throughout the remainder of the year as it usually does. And as I mentioned earlier, the timing of milestone payments with our licensing and collaboration partners has a factor -- is a factor in that particular expense category. And compared to last year, first quarter of 2011, really 2 factors. One is the timing of milestone payments that occurred in first quarter '11 and no such comparable payments in the first quarter of '12. And remember that it wasn't until middle of 2011 that we stopped the drug-eluting stent development program. And so there was some lower R&D spend as a result of no DES development in 2012.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And Louise, your comments on endomechanical, I think, were very clear. I just wondered if you had a little more detail, specifically your commentary on low-cost competition. I think we've heard that before. But on MIS, or minimally invasive penetration, is that simply a move to single-incision procedures? Or is that pressure potentially from robotic competition? I didn't know if you had that detail.","Louise Mehrotra","It seems to be a consistent commentary that we're receiving from the company. But that particular detail, I don't have, David, sorry. We will now get some final remarks from Dominic.","Dominic J. Caruso","Okay. Thanks, Louise, and thank you, everyone. As I said earlier, we're off to a good start in Q1 and we're in line with our own expectations. We remain very optimistic for the remainder of the year, and we see further opportunity for growth as the global economy stabilizes. And as our new products, our robust pipelines and our core businesses continue addressing the critical unmet health care needs of patients and customers, I remain confident in our prospects for the year, thanks to the dedication, focus and integrity of the people of Johnson & Johnson. And I look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year. Thanks for your time this morning, and have a wonderful day."],"12652":["Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October 16, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Chris DelOrefice - VP, IR","Joe Wolk - EVP and CFO","Jorge Mesquita - EVP and Worldwide Chairman, Consumer","Jennifer Taubert - EVP and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals","Ashley McEvoy - EVP and Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices","Analysts","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Chris Schott - JP Morgan","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners","Jason Bedford - Raymond James","Amit Hazan - Citi","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Geoff Meacham - Barclays","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Chris DelOrefice","Hello. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the investor conference call to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the third quarter of 2018.","I am pleased to be joined for a discussion today by Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide commentary on the quarter\u2019s financial performance along with an update on our guidance for 2018. Additionally, I\u2019m pleased to be joined by the leaders of our business segments who will participate in our Q&A session. Joining me today in New Brunswick are Jorge Mesquita, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Consumer; Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; we also via phone, Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson and joining us on today\u2019s call.","Our strong third quarter results included areas of strength across all segments of our business. Consumer\u2019s operational growth accelerated across all franchises and all major regions in our portfolio and also benefitted from the relaunch of our iconic Johnson\u2019s Baby brand in the U.S. ","Our Pharmaceutical business demonstrated strong, above-market growth, fueled by multiple innovative products. We continue to successfully navigate overall market dynamics and are confident in our proven business model to enable us to deliver sustainable growth.","Medical Devices continues to enhance market-leading positions in many key platforms and delivered improved performance across more platforms than prior quarters to deliver on our goal of above-market performance in 2020. Specifically, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, we saw another quarter of improved growth in hospital Medical Devices with almost a full point improvement versus the second quarter of 2018. As in enterprise, we continue to exceed near-term financial expectations, while managing the business for the long term to benefit patients, customers and shareholders.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. There, you can also find additional materials including today\u2019s presentation and associated schedules.","Please note that this mornings\u2019 presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding commentary included in today\u2019s discussion, as well as the Company\u2019s Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected.","Our SEC filings, including our 2017 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today\u2019s discussion to the most comparable GAAP measure are all available at investor.jnj.com.","A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. We anticipate today\u2019s webcast to last approximately 75 minutes.","Now, I\u2019m pleased to share our results for the quarter.","Worldwide sales were $20.3 billion for the third quarter of 2018, a 3.6% increase versus the third quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.5% as currency had a negative impact of 1.9%. In the U.S., sales were up 3.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.5% with the effect of currency exchange rates reducing our reported OUS results by 4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide, 3.9% in the U.S. and 8.5% outside the U.S. I will provide the same reference for each segment.","With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $3.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.44 versus $1.37 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.05, representing increases of 7.3% and 7.9% respectively compared to the same period in 2017. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9.5%. Joe will discuss earnings further in his remarks.","Beginning with Consumer, I\u2019ll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment, highlighting items to build upon the slides that will be presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages reference represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2017, or in other words, results that exclude the impact of currency translation.","Worldwide Consumer sales totaled $3.4 billion, growing 4.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, mainly the divestiture of the Compeed business in the Wound Care\/Other franchise outside the U.S., total adjusted operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide. Performance in the quarter was positively impacted by the restocking of retail inventory to support the relaunch of our Johnson\u2019s Baby portfolio in the U.S. that we highlighted last quarter. Excluding this impact, our adjusted operational growth was approximately 5.4%, representing above-market growth for our Consumer segment this quarter.","Beauty led the Consumer segment performance growing 6.5% or just above 8% when adjusting for divestitures, primarily Nizoral. The U.S. realized strong category consumption and growth including continued strong performance in e-commerce. The NEUTROGENA brand delivered strong results, primarily reflecting growth in facial moisturizing and share gains in sun protection. Additionally, the OGX and Maui Moisture brands delivered strong performance, growing share globally.","Results outside the U.S. were also driven by the Asia Pacific region where Dr.Ci:Labo and NEUTROGENA brands had strong uptake. OTC also delivered strong results, growing 6.8%, or slightly above 6% adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures, mainly our recent acquisition of Zarbee\u2019s. In the U.S., we grew overall category market share by 0.6 points versus prior year with strong consumption across many key categories such as upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC for allergy relief, IMODIUM for digestive health, and TYLENOL, and MOTRIN in analgesics. We also deliver strong growth outside of the U.S. across our portfolio, led by performance in antismoking aids, driven by new product innovation.","As previously referenced, we successfully relaunched our Johnson\u2019s Baby product line and achieved growth of 4.3% this quarter. Excluding the benefit of the retail inventory restocking, the business was essentially flat versus prior year. While it is early, we\u2019re excited about the progress of the relaunch as we realized strong consumption in the month of September.","Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.3 billion grew 8.2% with double-digit growth in nine key products, resulting in continued above-market performance. The segment was led by performance of the oncology portfolio, growing about 39% globally.","DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing globally by approximately 60%. In the U.S., market growth and strong launch uptake of the one prior line indication is resulting in share gains. Outside the U.S., DARZALEX is experiencing increased penetration and share gains in the 31 EMEA countries where it is commercially available as well as in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region where it gained approval late last year. This strong broad-based volume growth was partially offset by a onetime adjustment outside the U.S. related to accruals for retroactive reimbursement matters, which negatively impacted worldwide DARZALEX growth by 16 points.","IMBRUVICA grew approximately 40% globally with growth in the U.S. of 45%. Based on second quarter data, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 3 points of market share versus prior year, across all lines of therapy, largely driven by share in line one Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or CLL. The CLL line one market is estimated to have grown approximately 14% in the same period.","ZYTIGA grew approximately 45% due to continued strong market growth and share gains, primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high-risk castration sensitive prostate cancer, based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. In non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA with the penetration of prescribers split evenly among neurology and oncology practices.","In immunology, we delivered global sales growth of 5%, driven by continued strong performance in STELARA of 17% and SIMPONI\/SIMPONI ARIA of approximately 15% offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 15% due to competition from biosimilars.","REMICADE has maintained approximately 93% of the infliximab volume share. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn\u2019s disease where market share has increased approximately 7 points compared to the third quarter of 2017. Lastly, sales of our newly launched treatment for psoriasis, TREMFYA totaled $171 million globally. TREMFYA is experiencing strong demand with over 25,000 patients on therapy and achieved a 5.8% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S.","In neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate, long-acting, injectable portfolio delivered strong global growth of approximately 18%, driven by new patient starts and persistency. We did experience negative growth in our cardiovascular metabolism and other product portfolio, primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA. Additionally, XARELTO declined by 3.6% with continued share growth being offset by increased rebates including approximately 6 points of a negative impact from prior quarter adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, XARELTO\u2019s underlying growth would have been approximately 2.5%.","Subsequent to the quarter, the U.S. FDA approved XARELTO for a new 2.5 milligram vascular dose, making XARELTO the first and only Factor Xa inhibitor to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke in people with chronic coronary or peripheral artery disease. This indication significantly increases XARELTO\u2019s treatable patient population by approximately 13 million patients in the U.S.","In pulmonary hypertension, we realized strong growth in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. OPSUMIT grew globally approximately 21% with similar growth, both inside and outside the U.S., and UPTRAVI grew 38% globally, both driven by further market penetration and increased share. As expected TRACLEER is declining as generics entered the European market during the second half of last year.","I\u2019ll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 1.7%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neuroscience, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9% worldwide. This growth represents an acceleration versus the first half of 2018.","We continue to strengthen our market leading positions in our electrophysiology and vision businesses while also improving performance in spine and keens and our orthopedics portfolio. Growth is partially offset by declines in our diabetes care business.","Subsequent to the quarter, we announced the completion of the divestiture of our LifeScan business, which is consistent with our approach to strategic portfolio optimization.","Interventional Solutions grew 19.4% globally with continued strength in our electrophysiology business, which grew more than 23% worldwide, fueled by our market leadership position in the space from newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters, contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. This represents the highest growth that we realized in any quarter over the last nine plus years of double-digit growth. Additionally, we realized strong double-digit growth in our Cerenovus business, fueled by new product innovation, including the launch of EMBOTRAP for the treatment of ischemic stroke.","Moving to our vision business. The contact lens business continued to grow above market at 6.2% worldwide on the strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS family. In Vision Surgical, worldwide growth of 4.1% was driven by international intraocular lens growth in cataracts.","In orthopedics, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestitures of Codman Neuroscience and Prodisc in spine, performance was flat to third quarter 2017. In hips, we grew market share, leveraging our leadership position in the anterior approach, and continue to see strong demand for the primary stem ACTIS.","Trauma was flat due to the lower market growth along with continued pricing pressure in the U.S. market. As the clear market leader in this segment, we continue to see strong adoption of newer innovation such as our TFNA Femoral Nail.","Performance improved in both spine and knees, although we are committed to doing better. Spine performance improved for the third straight quarter, driven by new products such as the Concorde Lift Expandable Interbody implant and the Viper Prime system for minimally invasive surgery.","Our performance in knees accelerated to approximately 1% growth due to the continued strong uptake of ATTUNE revision system and aided by the onetime impact of price legislation in India in 2017.","Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms by approximately negative 6% in spine, negative 3.5% in hips, negative 2.5% in knees and negative 2% in trauma.","We were very pleased with the results for the surgery group. The advanced surgery performance with strong, led by double-digit growth outside the U.S. On a worldwide basis, endocutters grew 10% and energy grew 4.5% as new products are experiencing strong demand, especially outside the U.S. Biosurgery grew over 9%, driven by strong demand, fueled by new innovation such as SURGICEL powder. In general surgery, wound closure grew 3.5% with growth in all regions as barbed and plus sutures are experiencing strong adoption.","Selling days had a negligible impact on Medical Devices in Q3. And as previously communicated, we don\u2019t expect a material impact globally for the remainder of this year, but there could be some variances by region.","As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the second quarter of 2018, we saw an increase in hospital admissions of about 1.5%, surgical procedures were up approximately 1% and lab procedures were up about 2%. Our preliminary estimates for the third quarter indicate a modest decline in hospital admissions growth to 1% with surgical procedures and lab procedures growth consistent with the second quarter at approximately 1% and 2%, respectively.","That concludes the sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2018 third quarter. For your reference, this slide summarizes notable developments that occurred in the third quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Wolk, who will provide further insights on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s quarterly financial results.","Joe Wolk","Thank you, Chris. It is great to have you in the Investor Relations role. Good morning, everyone.","As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter results, a product of the effort and the contributions made by our Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Our performance reflects the progress we\u2019re making against the robust strategies and plans that we have put in place across all three segments and that we\u2019ve been sharing with you throughout 2018.","I\u2019d also like to welcome Ashley, Jorge and Jennifer to today\u2019s call. These are performance-based leaders who embody our credo-based culture. We all look forward to answering your questions about our business later in the call.","Since Chris already provided many details on sales, I\u2019ll provide only a brief few comments on revenue before focusing the discussion on cash, the income statement and guidance for the remainder of 2018.","In Consumer, we\u2019re very encouraged by the third quarter results, which are consistent with our plan to deliver above-market performance in the year that we shared at Analyst Day. Over-the-counter medicines and beauty continued to thrive, and we are very pleased with the early positive feedback related to our Johnson\u2019s Baby relaunch. We launched in the United States, China and India during the quarter, and we plan to continue the full global rollout into 2019.","Our Medical Devices performance is also consistent with our Analyst Day plans. The third quarter reflected accelerated strength in already strong franchises such as electrophysiology, biosurgery and endocutters, and improvement in areas that underperformed in recent quarters, most notably spine and knees. The third quarter is a positive step toward our goal of returning to above-market performance by 2020.","In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to be an industry leader across many performance measures, including sales growth, R&D productivity and commercial capabilities. While we\u2019ll face tougher comparisons in the Pharmaceuticals segment through the remainder of this year as well as biosimilar and generic competition, we are confident in the strength of our business. Our growth, as in prior quarters, is the result of our approach to innovation and delivering transformational products. Our growth continues to be driven by volume rather than price.","Being broadly based in healthcare allows us to continue to seek opportunities and we can uniquely drive value through our cross-segment collaboration and external partnering. One example is in the managed care setting where we are combining our patient and provider insights, our behavioral science expertise and our human centered design methods to enable a health insurance customer and a retail customer to collectively deliver a better experience for a priority patient population. This kind of collaboration is indicative of how we live into our credo and our commitment to ensure that good health is within reach for everyone everywhere. We will continue to use our broad base to provide new solutions in healthcare and meet the needs of patients and consumers, globally.","Starting with cash, I will now highlight other key financial activity for this quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $12 billion of net debt which consists of approximately $19 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $31 billion of debt.","Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2018, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2018 third quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.7 billion on an after tax basis, driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion and an in-process R&D charge of $900 million, which is primarily related to the partial write-down of Alios Biopharma, as noted in this morning\u2019s press release. Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.05, exceeding the mean of analyst estimates and an increase of 7.9% versus the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.08, up 9.5% versus the third quarter of 2017.","I\u2019d like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed in the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Gross profit margin for the quarter improved by 280 basis points, primarily driven by favorable business mix as well as the impact of the Actelion inventory step-up charge recorded in 2017.","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.3%, which is lower than the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the timing of investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $297 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items recorded in this line, other income and expense was lower with a net gain of $32 million in 2018, compared to a net gain of $578 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the sale of the consumer Compeed business in the third quarter of last year.","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.6% compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full-year effective tax rate. The lower rate compared to the third quarter of last year is the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We anticipate the U.S. Treasury will issue further regulatory guidance later this year, specifically related to foreign tax credits and expense allocation against international income. Our tax rate guidance, which I will provide shortly, reflects these anticipated developments.","Let\u2019s now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2018, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise declined 20 basis points versus the third quarter of 2017. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment. Medical Devices at 27.1% is lower than the previous year, primarily due to investments in the business. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 380 basis points to 44.8%, driven by favorable product mix and timing of research and development spend. Consumer margins declined to 17.1% due to a prior year divestiture gain, previously mentioned, partially offset by investment spend.","Turning to guidance for you to consider as you update your models. Our sales guidance for 2018 continues to include erosion due to the biosimilar competition impacting REMICADE, continued generic competition for CONCERTA and VELCADE, and the expected generic and biosimilar competition to TRACLEER and PROCRIT, later this year.","Our guidance is based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is consistent with past guidance practice and the way we manage our business to provide the best understanding of our underlying performance. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2018 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","For the full-year 2018, we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales of 5.5% to 6.0% for the year, an increase over the guidance we provided in July. This growth would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $80.6 billion to $81 billion. We expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures will be between 4.5% and 5.0% for the year, also an increase to our previous guidance.","Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.15, the positive impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 0.5%. The trade is below previous guidance, which assumed a spot rate of 1.17 and results in a 30 basis-point reduction in growth, compared to that previous guidance. Therefore, under this scenario, we expect reported sales growth in the range of 6.0% to 6.5% or approximately $81 billion to $81.4 billion. Again, this is higher than our previous guidance due to our operational strength.","Our adjusted pretax operating margin guidance remains relatively unchanged. Although year-to-date performance suggests even greater improvement, we expect investments in the fourth quarter will result in the full-year pretax operating margin improvement of at least 150 basis points.","For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you to consider modeling net interest expense between $450 million and $500 million. This is lower than previous guidance as we benefit from an increase in interest income from higher rates.","Regarding other income and expense. We would be comfortable with your 2018 models, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, which is consistent with our previous guidance. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. This would include the gain associated with the divestiture of the LifeScan business announced subsequent to the quarter but does not include the divestiture of our Advanced Sterilization Products business, which we expect to close in 2019.","Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2018 excluding special items is approximately 17.5% to 18.0%, reflecting a tightening of the previous range. Considering all these factors, we are comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.98 to $8.03 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 9% to 10%, which is higher than our previous guidance, again reflecting the strength of our business.","We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, using recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS will be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.13 to $8.18 per share, reflecting growth of approximately 11.8% at the midpoint, which is also higher than our previous guidance.","That concludes our financial summary. I will now turn the call back over to Chris for the Q&A portion of the call where again, I\u2019m very pleased to be joined by Ashley, Jorge and Jennifer. Chris?","Chris DelOrefice ","Great. Thank you, Joe. We will now move on to our Q&A portion of today\u2019s discussion. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Sure. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Maybe a few questions. Because we have so many people on the call this morning, I\u2019ll be quick. Joe, I just want to start with financial for you and then one for Jennifer and one for Ashley. So, Joe, just the guidance you gave here for the year, I am sort of doing some net math here, it seems like margins for the fourth quarter are somewhere around the mid-20s, which is consistent with your historical spending into the fourth quarter. I just want to get a sanity check on that. And if you think about next year on other income, is it reasonable to expect other income levels in \u201819 similar to \u201818? And I have two quick follow-ups.","Joe Wolk","Yes. So, good morning, David. Good to hear from you. I would say with our margins for the fourth quarter, I would stand by the guidance that we just gave. You might have noticed the slight tweak in language. We\u2019ve gone from approximately 150 basis points to at least 150 basis points. So, we\u2019ll plan to invest in the fourth quarter much as you\u2019ve seen in previous years. With respect to other income and expense, I prefer to hold off till January when we give you 2019 guidance. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve commented in the past for quite some time now that when we do see a lessening of other income on that line, we will adjust accordingly with our operating margins.","David Lewis","Okay, very clear. And then, I\u2019ll ask my two questions here together. First for Jennifer. Just your growth ex ZYTIGA this quarter was around I think 6%. Is that a good way to think about 2019 Pharma growth? And can you just give us an update on where you\u2019re coming out on, whether the fourth quarter implies any impact from ZYTIGA? And then, just Ashley, and congrats by the way to both you on the new positions. But, the ortho basically was stable overall, but the U.S. knee franchise obviously remains under pressure. Can you just give us a sense of how much of this is ATTUNE perception issues versus robotics, and what\u2019s the pathway to recovery in U.S. knees? Thanks so much.","Jennifer Taubert","Great. Let me start in there. Good morning, David. First of all, we\u2019re really pleased with our third quarter performance for the pharmaceuticals sector. So, the 8.2% operational growth, which is above the market and growth coming that\u2019s broadly based across the portfolio with nine key brands achieving double digit growth and very strong performance as we look across the globe. As you noted, if we actually remove ZYTIGA from that mix, our growth was 6.6% operationally, so really, really strong performance. And so, I think what ZYTIGA shows and demonstrates, while we\u2019re pleased with ZYTIGA, we\u2019re absolutely not dependent on it.","As Joe indicated, we\u2019re not providing any guidance right now for 2019. And in previous sessions, we\u2019ve discussed sort of the process and the legal challenges that are underway. Right now, we\u2019re in the process of waiting for court ruling on ZYTIGA in our stay at the end of October, October 28, I believe. So, we\u2019re not going to make any speculations or predictions on that. In fact, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the Pharma performance overall and very, very broadly based throughout the portfolio.","Ashley McEvoy","David, good morning. No, I think for knees, with quarter three, I think you saw a little bit of a stabilization in quarter three in North America versus quarter two. We expect that to improve as we continue the rollout of our ATTUNE revision, which has gotten a very healthy uptick. And as we launch the cementless program in 2019, and then progress our digital surgery offering in Orthotaxy following in 2020, obviously coupled with very strong commercial excellence. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just Joe, couple of follow-ups on David\u2019s questions earlier. So, I know you\u2019re not giving 2019 guidance until January. But, maybe you could help us think about some of the headwinds and tailwinds we should be thinking about, some of the ones that people are interested in, specifically currency. We estimate, it\u2019s about 100 basis-point headwind right now. And REMICADE erosion, how that might compare in 2019 to 2018? And I had one follow up. ","Joe Wolk","Sure, Larry. Good morning. Good to speak with you. I think probably the best way for me to comment on currency is to say that we provide guidance on our operational performance and then just an estimate based on what the current spot rates are at the time. This year, it was much less of a tailwind than we thought when we were speaking with the investment community back in January, where we thought it would translate into about $1.5 billion of additional revenue reported. It\u2019s only turning out to be about 25% of that. But, we\u2019ve been able take up guidance based on just the solid operational strength of our underlying business. So, I won\u2019t comment, because it\u2019s just much too speculative as to what next year may hold with respect to a strengthening dollar.","And your second question with respect to REMICADE, I would say that\u2019s -- I wouldn\u2019t expect any kind of step change. I think what you\u2019ve seen this year is roughly 18% in the U.S. with biosimilar erosion. We continue to compete there. Most of that erosion is related to price. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that. Because we know that that\u2019s what patients and healthcare providers actually see as a product of most comfort. So, based on the safety and efficacy that we\u2019ve demonstrated for a number of years and across all indications, we feel pretty strong that it still has a very strong place in the market. And the good news, as we said before biosimilars launched is, the immunology portfolio with the expansion of the STELARA label as well as the introduction of TREMFYA, continues to grow in spite of REMICADE\u2019s erosion.","Larry Biegelsen","And Joe, you grew organically about 6% year-to-date including about 6% in Q3. Can you walk us through what your guidance assumes for organic growth in Q4? I\u2019m getting to about 2% at the midpoint. And I\u2019m wondering why you\u2019re assuming such a deceleration, because you just help us bridge that. Thanks for taking the questions.","Joe Wolk","Sure. Thanks, Larry. I know I can count on you for a math question. So, let me give you some things to think about. Obviously, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but I realize we\u2019ve got three quarters into the year, so, it becomes somewhat of a plug. But, let me give you that the qualitative things to consider as you model Q4, which we think are somewhat temporary or fleeting in nature. We do expect Medical Devices to continue that modest improvement quarter-on-quarter, strengthening in areas where we\u2019re already strong and then improving some of those areas that have underperformed in recent quarters. We do think we\u2019ve turned the corner with Consumer. We want to see more data points with that. But, the growth that belies this quarter of 6% adjusted operational, there\u2019s a slight I would say downward revision for that given some of the baby stocking. But, you\u2019re still into the mid-5 range. We think that\u2019s going to continue because it\u2019s underpinned by the baby franchise being rolled out across the globe. We\u2019re seeing strong receptivity for those products here in the U.S., China and India. And then, OTCs and beauty, skincare continue to perform at 6% levels.","With Pharmaceutical, you have some unique adjustments. I would say there\u2019s going to be some new generic and biosimilars entries with respect to TRACLEER and PROCRIT that we anticipate and is in our thinking for guidance in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll see continued erosion that wasn\u2019t around fourth quarter of last year, with respect to CONCERTA and VELCADE. We do have much higher comps with respect to Pharmaceutical business. As you know, in the second half of 2017 is really when that business reaccelerated its strength. And then lastly, there\u2019s a gross or net accrual that we\u2019ll be making related to 2019 activity. As we get ready for the New Year, we have inventory at wholesalers and we accrue on those rebates. And just given the size of our business and some of the contracts that we see coming through, we think that\u2019s going to be a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter here.","Operator","The next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Joe, I just have a big picture strategic question. J&J seems to be stuck in a pattern of Pharma outperforming but MD&D underperforming. And while you are starting to see evidence of improvement in certain pockets of that business, I think relative to your peer group, J&J\u2019s business has been a pretty visible underperformer. I was just wondering -- and this is sort of a narrative that we\u2019ve seen for many, many years now, are you satisfied with that narrative? And if not, what would it take to jumpstart that narrative and what would it take to jumpstart the MD&D business? Will it require a large scale transformative deal, which I think you\u2019ve somewhat alluded to, or is it more likely that you would stick to tuck-in deals? Is that the right way to look at it or do we just need to be patient and wait for new products to reach the market for that? I think your guidance is that this business would start to grow in line or better than the market by 2020. Just wondering if you could address that.","And then, I have a follow-up question for the Pharma. Just if you exclude REMICADE, I\u2019m just curious if prices or rebates have changed much in the immunology franchise, just given how crowded that space has become. Thanks very much.","Joe Wolk","Thanks for the question, Jamie. Well, I\u2019ll kick off the answer and then maybe kick it over to Ashley to talk a little bit more about the plans for going forward in Medical Devices. But, I would say, comparing us to the peer group in Med Devices can be little bit misleading. I don\u2019t know that anybody is at the breadth or scale that we have when you just look at the level of revenue. There is maybe one other competitor that\u2019s notable and we outperformed them. That being said, we are not satisfied with the performance in Medical Devices. We\u2019re seeing, improvements. Whether that\u2019s going to take a transformational deal or tuck in deal, we\u2019re looking at all of them across all segments of our businesses. We want to make sure it\u2019s a good strategic fit and that we can create value not just for the company but for shareholders going forward.","Ashley, maybe you can comment on a few things that will continue this upward momentum that we started in Medical Devices.","Ashley McEvoy","Jami, thanks for the question. And I guess I would offer ground on kind of where we come from and then clearly where we aim to be. And what we\u2019re fortunate to be is, in a very strong position with number two in med tech, and we have half of our platforms growing above the market, and we\u2019ve got very competitive profitability and very competitive free cash flow. So, what I\u2019d like to say, very strong purpose of what we do every day of helping people. So with that at our back, clearly we are very focused on flipping each of this platform that we\u2019re dissatisfied and have been underperforming the market. And our strategy to achieve this has really been through accelerating innovation. You heard us speak around 15 to 20 new products, and many of those are having very strong traction in the marketplace. I use examples like some of the spine innovations have been enabling some of that fine performance. I expect some of the innovations in the ATTUNE revision and getting metal-less will help us with knees. I expect some of the innovations that we\u2019re launching in energy and endocutters, particularly around like the ECHELON FLEX will help us.","We\u2019ve also been doing a lot of different M&A deals. We\u2019ve done about 26 deals this year, 5 of them have been acquisitions, 10 equity investments, 2 of them are divestitures; 1, which will hit in quarter four, which is diabetes, the other one will be ASP, which is early 2019; and then, several other co-promotes. So, I think we are very focused on accelerating those platforms that are in fact growing above the market. We\u2019re aligned on that strength, treating the ones that are underperforming through innovation, M&A and commercial excellence. And obviously we\u2019re always looking at transformative M&A but we haven\u2019t modeled in any of that.","Joe Wolk","Thank you, Ashley. And Jennifer, maybe you can address Jami\u2019s question regarding pricing at Pharmaceutical ex REMICADE.","Jennifer Taubert","Yes. And I believe Jami\u2019s question also was fairly focusing on immunology as well. And so, we definitely are seeing continued pressure on pricing in immunology as both the payers are working to extract greater rebates and discounts, and also as there is increase in competition in the key categories. However, that being said, I think given our strategy with being a transformational medical innovator, the types of products that we\u2019re bringing forward, the data that we\u2019re bringing forward and the types of analytics and things that we\u2019re doing in partnering with customers, I think we\u2019re really well-positioned to continue to compete and to be able to succeed in the market.","If you take a look at our products ex-REMICADE in the immunology category, we\u2019ve got very robust growth, taking a look at STELARA with that growth being led by our Crohn\u2019s indication; TREMFYA, which is really making significant inroads in psoriasis; and also SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA. And so, even if you include REMICADE, we\u2019re continuing to grow outside of that with the others, we\u2019ve got very robust growth.","So, going back, our growth really has been driven largely by volume and expanding our reach and reaching greater number of patients. And I continue to believe that that\u2019s how we\u2019ll be driving our growth going forward. So, yes, market is heating up in terms of discounts and rebates, but I think that we\u2019re well-positioned to be able to continue to compete successfully.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just two here. Maybe first -- another one on drug pricing. I guess, as we look out to 2019, and now you have a bit more clarity on some of your contracting, should we expect any major shifts in price dynamics for your Pharma business next year, based on these conversations or should we think about really a similar dynamic that we saw in 2018?","My second question was on DARZALEX. Sales were maybe bit below expectations. I think you mentioned some ex-U.S. price adjustments impacting results. So, just elaborate little bit more on the trends you\u2019re seeing with the product and what\u2019s specifically happening ex-U.S. on pricing? Thank you.","Jennifer Taubert","Sure. So on the pricing front overall, I think as we look into 2019 and what we\u2019re seeing in the contract, I think that we\u2019re going to see a continued evolution in some of the categories where there are very high level of competitors. But, it\u2019ll be an evolution in pricing, not a revolution or a step change. But, it definitely continues to be an area of focus for the payers and in that heavily contracted categories.","If we take a look at DARZALEX, so DARZALEX had very strong performance with 60% growth worldwide, sales nearly $500 million. And it was very strong, both based in the U.S. and ex-U.S. What you\u2019re referring to and what we had mentioned relating to ex-U.S.is that we did have a onetime adjustment related to accruals for retroactive reimbursement, and that negatively impacted the DARZALEX worldwide growthby 16 points. This is just a normal adjustment, as we negotiate with governments to get reimbursement in some of the ex-U.S.markets. And we see this as a normal course of business and really a onetime adjustment. But DARZALEXoverall is demonstrating very, very strong growth and another strong quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi. Good morning. Two questions for Jennifer on the pipeline. Two key drivers over the next couple years, ERLEADA which was just launched and then, ESKETAMINE, which you are hoping to launch in 2019. So, Jennifer, on ESKETAMINE, I just want to get your sense of confidence in FDA approval. I\u2019m really asking is, you did five Phase 3s, three were positive, I think two missed their primary endpoints, but nonetheless, very good safety data. So, what\u2019s your confidence in approval? And do you think we may need an FDA panel for ESKETAMINE? And then, on ERLEADA, I know you\u2019re not giving the actual sales numbers, but when we track IMS data, ERLEADA is off to a slightly slower start than we would have expected. So, maybe talk about your expectations for ERLEADA as well? Thank you. ","Jennifer Taubert","So, for ESKETAMINE, we\u2019re really excited about ESKETAMINE\u2019s potential for treatment resistant depression and also hopefully in the future, major depressive disorder, and for those patients who are at imminent risk of suicidality. Both of those products -- or programs, excuse me, have FDA breakthrough designation, which represents the significant unmet medical need.","We are really confident in the totality of our data across the ESKETAMINE program and what we have filed both with the U.S. authorities as well as the EMEA authorities. It\u2019s really difficult in these types of trials to prove success, as you know, as you take a look across the industry. And we believe that across the totality of our data, we\u2019ve got a very, very robust program and robust data and are hopeful and optimistic for approval.","In terms of an FDA panel, I don\u2019t know if we have heard from the -- back from the agency yet, if we will have one or not. They are typically standard for first-in-class or a new mechanism. So, I think, our team is going to anticipate and prepare for one. And as soon as -- I don\u2019t know if we have the actual answer on that. But that would not be unusual in any respect. I think, the default is everyone gets a panel, unless the agency says no on that.","And the other question was on ERLEADA. So we have launched ERLEADA in the U.S. I believe we\u2019re not yet reporting sales on that in terms of numbers. We\u2019re pleased with the uptake. As you know with ERLEADA, this is in the pre-metastatic setting. So, it\u2019s in the earlier course of disease, both urologists and oncologists prescribe for it. There is very strong, both awareness and receptivity to the profile, the data and the label. And so, there is very strong interest in prescribing. But, we didn\u2019t anticipate -- you wouldn\u2019t anticipate to see the same type of uptake that you would in a later line of therapy. You really need to look at this as more of a chronic type of therapy with a chronic uptake ramp. But, what we\u2019ve seen today in terms of that provider and patient receptivity and uptake, we have been very pleased with ERLEADA. And we\u2019re also looking forward to data hopefully coming soon or early in 2019 in combination with ZYTIGA data as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. ","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning, and thank you very much for taking the questions. In no particular order, Vision Care, up 6.2%, growing faster than the market, could you please discuss if there is any stocking or onetime items in that and how do you see Johnson & Johnson going forward in terms of product pipeline? If I can just continue quickly. Orthopedic pricing was a little bit worse sequentially about 50 basis points. Is that just normal gyration or is there anything that we need to think about that? And then, a follow-up to David\u2019s question. How much do you think the lack of a robot in your orthopedic franchise is holding that back?","Ashley McEvoy","I guess, I\u2019ll start with your first question related to vision. So, Chris mentioned the performance in vision, and it really continues in contact lens. It\u2019s like the 13th quarter that we\u2019ve outperformed the market. Underlying growth in contact lenses remains around 7%, very consistent with the first half. I don\u2019t expect, to Chris\u2019s earlier point, a lot of additional selling days or any stocking events in Q3.","As it relates to the pipeline, I think that they have a healthy cadence. We mentioned the global rollout of OASYS 1-Dat for astigmatism. We are preparing for the right management launch of a contact lens which automatically adjusts from outdoor light to indoor light and also preparing within the next 24 months for our allergy lens. So, I think there\u2019s a healthy cadence there in vision. I believe your question on orthopedics, if you could repeat, Joanne, your question on orthopedics?","Joanne Wuensch","Of course. Thank you for taking my speed questions. It looks like pricing is about 50 basis points worse across the board, this quarter versus last quarter, and I just didn\u2019t know if I should read anything into that.","Jennifer Taubert","I think what we referenced earlier with Chris is spine is a little bit softer than some of the other joint businesses; hips and knees are pretty consistent at that 2% to 3%. And we don\u2019t anticipate significant shift in upcoming quarters. I do think it\u2019s a good news that our orthopedics business, I will use the word, stabilized in quarter three and the mix improved with hips performing up 2.4%. We had our Craniomaxillofacial growing 2.4%. you heard Chris mention that our knees were up 1 point and that spine continued to improve versus prior quarters. Spine was down around 7.5% in the quarter one and was down about 3.2% in quarter two and down about 1.4% in quarter three. So, clearly, progress but still work to be done on orthopedics. And I believe your last question was related to robots. And I guess, what I would offer is we have a good fortune to enjoy really very strong market leading position in open surgery, which is about 50% of all surgeries are conducted as well as minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. And we intend to have offerings in digital surgery as well as offerings in endoluminal surgery. And we really think that having contribution in all four of those segments will enable a future surgery that J&J can really add a lot of value.","So, clearly robotics are having an impact in today\u2019s market. The penetrations are still low, although growing. And I envision Johnson & Johnson has a very competitive offering in the foreseeable future related to digital surgery.","Operator","The next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Danielle Antalffy","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, this question is for Ashley. I just wanted to follow-up on a comment you made earlier regarding transformative M&A. Just curious what you would define as transformative M&A within the device business. And one follow-up to that. Obviously transformative M&A would -- I mean, presumably, that\u2019ll be a large deal. So, in the meantime, it feels like the device business, while you guys are certainly been turning the business around, is still below market growth. You highlighted a number of drivers as it relates to new product launches. But, it feels like it\u2019s going a little bit slower than maybe some people would expect. Are there smaller tuck-in deals that can be done between now and any sort of transformative deal that could accelerate you guys back to in line with market growth? Thank you so much.","Ashley McEvoy","Joe, I\u2019ll turn to you first and I\u2019m happy to complement with some commentary.","Joe Wolk","Sure. So, thanks for the question, Danielle. With respect to transformative deals or truck-in deals, again, we look at all scale of deals. Last year alone in medical devices, we invested slightly over $1 billion with the 30 tuck-in deals and you\u2019re seeing some of that improve the performance within the Medical Device segment right now. So, again it\u2019s going to come back to those core principles of making sure it\u2019s a strategic fit and then creating value for shareholders.","Ashley McEvoy","I would just complement that Danielle with just saying, again historically, 50% of innovation has come from inorganic versus organic, and that blend will continue. As Joe mentioned even in 2018, we\u2019ve already done 26 deals, some those acquisitions, some of those equity, some of those co-promotes. So, it really has to do with the strategic fit and the value-creation in each of the platforms that we compete in.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason Bedford with Raymond James.","Jason Bedford","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple quickies. First on devices, maybe for Ashley. The 23% growth in Biosense Webster is a notable step-up. You mentioned contribution from new products but you also talked about strong procedure growth. So, I\u2019m just wondering, have you seen any pickup in market growth from the CABANA results last spring?","Ashley McEvoy","Thank you, Jason. Yes. We did enjoy 23% growth in quarter three. I think it\u2019s been a very strong combination of market procedures continuing to increase as well as a very strong focus on commercial execution and market creation on ablation, as well as very-balanced geographic growth. We enjoyed in our Biosense Webster business growth of 34% in Asia and 11% in EMEA as well as 20% in North America; again, the combination of core performance as well as some of the new products taking effect.","Jason Bedford","Okay. Thank you.","Joe Wolk","The CABANA data, I would say that\u2019s -- it maybe had a slight impact in terms of overall procedural market growth, but nothing that the team called out as a significant driver.","Jason Bedford","Okay. So, there is clearly some share capture here in your view? [Audio Gap]","Joe Wolk","Next question, please?","Operator","The next question is from Amit Hazan with Citi.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just maybe start with the utilization stats that you guys gave. The U.S. surgical procedures are now up for a second straight quarter in a row after I think like 7 straight down quarters. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you guys could take a stab at trying to explain what might be happening with underlying surgical procedures in the U.S.?","Joe Wolk","Thanks, Amit for question. So, I think, when we look at a strong economy across the globe where -- is really where our strength has been. If you look, we\u2019re actually growing outside the U.S. stronger, 2X times what we\u2019ve grown here in the U.S. But, a strong economy does tend to lend itself to better coverage and better healthcare. So, that is helping underpin some of the procedural growth that we\u2019re seeing.","Amit Hazan","Okay. And then, specifically, with regard to your surgery business, the U.S. advanced piece, in the U.S. there was obviously a good number this quarter. But, you\u2019re actually still trending about 2% growth for the year versus about 6% for the past few years. Maybe just some color for you guys on why you\u2019re having slower growth in advanced this year, and just kind of a similar trend in U.S. general as well?","Ashley McEvoy","This is Ashley speaking. A couple of things. One, in our Ethicon surgical business, clearly we enjoy many market leading positions. And I\u2019ll come back to the next. What I\u2019m pleased to see is that our endocutter business is up 10% in quarter three, our biosurgery up 9%. Consistent growth in our wound closure where we enjoy market leading, really driven by some innovation on barbed sutures, and a lot of evidence generation strategy related to the antimicrobial effect for infection reduction. We are seeing challenges clearly in reprocessing and robotics in some of our energy and endomechanical business.","OUS, our energy business is performing quite well, but we are experiencing some challenges in the U.S. related to robotics and some reprocessing. I do expect that when -- the advancement of our robotic offering and digital surgery in forthcoming years that will help ameliorate that. We\u2019ve also dialed up the innovation agenda and our endomechanical and energy business to really stronger -- compete in the handheld market.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just a couple, maybe just one to follow up on some of the comments around drug pricing, those -- we\u2019ve seen a lot from the administration yesterday. Obviously the proposal came out around meeting to include, and some of the TV ads. And I\u2019m just curious that you can maybe provide your perspective on this issue and just do you think this is something useful or not useful? And maybe more broadly, any other sort of broader changes that you think might be implemented by the administration, I think, that sort of played out here over the last several months?","And then, second is just on DARZALEX. I appreciate the comments you made about the quarter. I\u2019m just curious about the MAIA study. And I think that was previously listed as potential clinical presentation this year. It\u2019s not on the given slide now. And I\u2019m assuming, you\u2019re still going to get that internally. And just I\u2019m asking if you can clarify exactly when you expect that data, and should we expect some sort of top-line press release when you receive it? And then maybe, again, generally how important that data is to the longer term outlook for that product? Thanks.","Jennifer Taubert","So, as it relates yesterday to the administration\u2019s proposal, as well as hopefully you saw as well that PhRMA put forward some new principles that the PhRMA members will be adhering to. We really believe that patients should have access to the information that is helpful and that they can use to make the best decisions regarding their health. And so, this does include greater transparency around health care costs. And so, we\u2019ve been a leader in transparency to-date. That\u2019s why we provide information about how we price our medicines and how we invest our resources in our annual U.S. Transparency Report.","So, we are absolutely working in partnership with PhRMA around PhRMA\u2019s announcements yesterday and what we can do on DTC pricing. This has been done in line with what we learned from customers and patients, and what they think is actually going to be helpful, which is not only information on list pricing, but also putting that information into the right context. So, what that actually means for them, since list point -- list price is really just a starting point. So for patients, what is their likely out of pocket costs going to be, what types of financial assistance is available in addition to information, like the list price. So, we\u2019re going to respond to the agency\u2019s proposal. There\u2019s 60 days we\u2019re going to go ahead and respond to that and provide our input, in the meantime, go ahead and implement what we\u2019re executing and what we\u2019re doing in line with PhRMA on that.","Again, I think anything that is helpful and useful for patients and helps to put all the information in context is going to be really good for them. I think, we just need to be careful of things such as list price alone is not the full extent of the information. And we would worry about patients not going to their doctor to seek care, not going in for the appropriate treatments. So, we believe we\u2019re doing the right thing with just the PhRMA proposal, and we\u2019ll just to have to wait and see what happens with Secretary Azar\u2019s proposal that he announced yesterday.","Joe Wolk","Yes. And regarding DARZALEX, it\u2019s 2019 filing; it\u2019s an event driven. So, that\u2019s all we\u2019re sharing at this point in time.","Jennifer Taubert","And we\u2019re very optimistic about that data. And we think it will be an important further catalyst for DARZALEX is that is that data will be the regimen that is most commonly used in the United States. So, we already have that frontline data and used with VELCADE, ex-U.S. as well as approved in the U.S. We think the data including REVLIMID is going to be really important going forward for the U.S. market.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. ","Bob Hopkins","Thank you very much and good morning. Joe, if okay, I wanted to ask a quick question on emerging markets. Obviously, emerging markets have been in the press quite a bit lately, both in terms of volatility of currency and emerging market economies. So, I\u2019m just curious, can you give us a sense, in your third calendar quarter, kind of what to happened your businesses in emerging markets, maybe some flavor by division, if okay just in terms of did anything really change in terms of underlying demand or the growth rate that you achieved in emerging markets in your three big divisions? Thank you.","Joe Wolk","Yes. Thanks for the question, Bob. So in our emerging markets, we saw very healthy growth; in total, it\u2019s about on operational basis almost 13%. And it was pretty uniform across the board, I would say BRIC specifically was very strong with 15% or better growth in Brazil, Russia and China. Maybe I can turn it over to Jorge, because we did see some particular strength out of our consumer business and maybe just talk about the consumer results at large in the third quarter. Obviously, that was a significant step change for us, performing what we believe is going to be twice the market. And Jorge, maybe if you can share a few of those thoughts?","Jorge Mesquita","Sure. Thanks, Joe. Yes, we feel very good about our results in the third quarter, growing overall north of 6% organically. And as Joe mentioned, the emerging markets were contributor to this growth, growing above 10% across the key geographies. Particularly, we saw a very strong performance in the BRIC markets. And we continue to expect that over time, the emerging world will continue to grow at twice the rate of overall of our business at a global level. Underpinning our performance was a significant improvement in our baby care business. We\u2019re very pleased with the early results coming out of our state tour in the United States. And as Joe mentioned, we\u2019re now going to roll that out across the world, starting with India and China. And we expect to complete the global rollout across the emerging world into 2019. So, we are -- despite the occasional volatility in some functional markets, I think overall, we\u2019re bullish on the outlook for the emerging world as we go forward. ","Bob Hopkins","That\u2019s super helpful. Maybe just, Joe, one quick follow-up on that. So, it sounds like underlying demand is very strong across the board, especially as you mentioned, Consumer. But, given the volatility in emerging market currencies, maybe just qualitatively or quantitatively, as you look forward, is that a meaningful headwind to reported EPS, as we look forward, given the volatility or is that something that\u2019s in your mind very manageable, relative to all the different moving pieces that are involved with the J&J income statement?","Joe Wolk","Bob, it\u2019s a good question. I would think it should be a manageable headwind, and obviously, it\u2019s going to depend on how much currencies fluctuate. But, we\u2019re not overly tied to currencies in emerging markets. So, it should be manageable.","Bob Hopkins","Terrific. Thanks for taking the questions.","Joe Wolk","I just want to take a moment here too and follow up maybe on Jennifer\u2019s comments with respect to Secretary Azar\u2019s proposal and just be very clear that with -- we support the administration\u2019s spirit of transparency and getting more information out there. I think the position of PhRMA right now is we want to make sure that we provide that information in a way that\u2019s meaningful and provides clarity to patients. Having list price on DTC ads could be somewhat confusing and actually act as a deterrent to good responsible healthcare. And we just want to make sure that that doesn\u2019t play out that way. But certainly looking to digest the proposal and put it into practice, the best way possible that\u2019s meaningful for patients and the healthcare system.","Operator","The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just had a few for Jennifer and maybe Joe too. To revisit the 2019 question, you guys haven\u2019t given a formal view, but just given the headwind on Pharma organic growth from ZYTIGA and the other LOAs. If you\u2019re not above market growth, does that change strategic priorities, either you attitude towards deals or investments across different therapeutic categories?","Joe Wolk","Yes. So, Geoff, maybe the first thing is to clarify the question that we currently believe we are the holder of a strong patent and we plan to defend those rights. We\u2019re looking forward to the judge\u2019s decision later this month. But, as Jennifer indicated, our growth, even without ZYTIGA was very strong. There are some potentially generic headwinds on the horizon. Should that for some reason put us below market, which is not something that other companies face, given the breadth of our portfolio, we\u2019ve got 12 brands in Pharmaceuticals that deliver better than $1 billion in revenue. We can absorb that. So, we\u2019re not in a situation where we\u2019re going to take a year or two off from growth. And anything that\u2019s at market is probably only temporary because we\u2019ve got good confidence in our pipeline going forward.","Geoff Meacham","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Joe. And then, a few product specific questions for Pharma. For DARZALEX, how has the duration of therapy been tracking? And how do you guys feel the refractory myeloma space evolving when you look at the cell therapies for BCMA? And then, on XARELTO, I just want to get a sense for the feedback from the field following MARINER and COMMANDER since ESC and just trying to put these data in context of the overall brand? Thanks.","Jennifer Taubert","Sure, I can start off on the XARELTO piece. So, we just got approval last week for a CAD and PAD, and the team is actually out launching it as we speak. So, product is in the market and the teams are out in the market, launching and bringing XARELTO and the 2.5 milligram dose to patients. And so, we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to expand XARELTO as the first Factor 10a inhibitor in the CAD, PAD space, which expands the opportunity by I think 13 million additional patients in the U.S. alone. And the data is quite striking in that indication, 24% reduction in CV death, strokes and heart attacks. So, we\u2019re really very optimistic about this launch for XARELTO.","As it relates to MARINER and the data that we have across the medically ill space, we are working with the agency on that and do believe that there is a good path forward in that space for XARELTO. So, probably can\u2019t say anymore than that on that right now. But, we will be continuing to pursue that with the FDA going forward. So, we believe there is a good reasons for future growth in XARELTO as well as continued growth in share gains in both the AFib and DVT prevention and treatment space. And the other question was on sort of CAR-T and DARZALEX?","Geoff Meacham","Around DARZALEX and CAR-T, how they might play together?","Jennifer Taubert","Yes. So, we actually think that they\u2019re complementary in the multiple myeloma space. And so, we\u2019re very excited about CAR-T. We\u2019ve dosed our first patient already, which is a very, very fast timeline versus when we did that deal with Legend. I think if you take a look at the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma, there -- it still remains significant need. And so, I think having both, DARZALEX as well as what we got with the BCMA CAR-T together will be a nice portfolio for patients, which will allow us to continue to grow.","Geoff Meacham","Okay, great. Thank you.","Chris DelOrefice","So, that concludes today\u2019s Q&A portion. Thanks to everyone who asked a question today and apologies to those who we could not get to due to time. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as is needed with any follow-ups. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Joe for some closing remarks.","Joe Wolk","Great. Thanks Chris. Thank you, Ashley, Jorge, Jennifer for sharing your insights on our business and delivering your -- with your team\u2019s very strong results for the third quarter. I hope it is clear to you and the investment community that our business is very strong. And we look forward to living into the new guidance that we have articulated earlier today for 2018. Thanks for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Joseph Wolk","Good morning. I'm Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the review of our business results for the third quarter of 2016. Joining me on the call today are, Dominic Caruso, Chief Financial Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; and Dr. Bill Hait, Global Head of Pharmaceutical Research & Development.","A few logistics before we discuss the results. This review is being made available via Webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web-site at investor.jnj.com. I will begin today's presentation by briefly reviewing the third quarter sales and earnings results for the corporation and sales results for each of our three business segments. Next, Joaquin and Bill will provide an update on our Pharmaceutical business, specifically highlighting how our focus on innovation to address unmet medical needs translates to current and future strong performance. Dominic will then provide some additional commentary on the results, review the income statement, and discuss guidance for 2016. Lastly, we will open the call to your questions.","We expect today's call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson Web-site, as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our Web-site.","I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and the Company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made here today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson Web-site.","During the course of today's presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide is an acknowledgement of those relationships.","I would now like to review our results. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016, up 4.2% versus the third quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.3% and currency had a negative impact of 0.1%. In the U.S., sales were up 6.7%, while regions outside the U.S. were up 1.5% comprised of 1.7% operational growth partially offset by a negative impact of currency exchange rate of 0.2%.","On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. declined 1.3%. You may recall that we highlighted growth in the second quarter of 2016 being favorably impacted by an inventory build, which did reversed in the third quarter. Europe grew by 3.2%, while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 1.4%.","Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 7.3% in the U.S. and 4.2% outside the U.S. Additionally, operations in Venezuela reduced reported sales growth. Worldwide, this impact was a reduction of 30 basis points, and outside the U.S. 70 basis points.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.53, versus $1.20 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and a charge of $175 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.","Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 12.2% and 12.8% respectively as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 12.8%.","Beginning with Consumer, let's now turn to segment highlights for the quarter. Please note that the percentage this quarter for all segments represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, increasing 0.1% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. sales were up 1.1% while sales outside the U.S. declined 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales fell 0.4% worldwide with a decline of 1.5% in the U.S. and growth of 0.3% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 110 basis points and 180 basis points respectively, with the most pronounced impact occurring in women's health.","Growth was driven by worldwide Skin Care and OTC sales outside the U.S. Baby Care experienced declines over the third quarter of 2015. Performance in the Consumer segment was negatively impacted by slower market growth and reductions of customer inventory levels. Overall, the impact of inventory reduction was approximately 3 points on worldwide Consumer sales growth for the quarter, with the most pronounced effect on OTC and Skin Care results. Dominic will discuss these factors in further detail later in the call.","OTC sales grew 1.8% worldwide. Results were driven by strong consumption in smoking cessation products across Europe and new product launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales growth due to share gains was partially offset by trade inventory levels impacting growth in the U.S. by approximately 10 points, where, as highlighted for the third quarter of 2015, the business experienced launch build in pain, allergy and digestive health. Also, a weak allergy season in the U.S. during 2016 negatively impacted inventory levels in the third quarter of 2016. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from 13% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 49%, up from 44% a year ago.","Skin Care grew 12.2% worldwide and 18.9% in the U.S. These results include the sales from the recent Vogue and NeoStrata acquisitions, which are captured in the U.S. OUS results were driven by stocking of DABAO products in China and share gains in Latin America. Inventory levels negatively impacted worldwide sales growth by 3 points. Successful marketing campaigns and new products continued to drive the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. Divestitures impacted sales growth in Wound Care\/Other and Women's Health categories.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 9.0%, with U.S. sales up 11.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.0%, driven by strong performance of new products as well as growth from our core products. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying worldwide sales growth was 10.7% as sales in the U.S. were up 13.0% and outside the U.S. up 7.0%.","Contributors to growth included; immunology products, REMICADE, SIMPONI and STELARA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX; as well as INVEGA SUSTENNA\/XEPLION\/TRINZA and XARELTO. In immunology, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI\/SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth in the U.S. due to market growth and increasing share for STELARA. The results reported for REMICADE export sales was driven entirely by a change in inventory levels, accounting for approximately 90 points of growth. Specifically, there was an inventory build of approximately $55 million in the current period and $110 million impact from lower level inventories that we noted in the third quarter of 2015 results. Biosimilar competition continues to negatively impact performance of the export sales.","In neuroscience, INVEGA SUSTENNA\/XEPLION\/TRINZA achieved strong results with worldwide sales growth of 21%, due primarily to increased market share. As expected, during the quarter we saw the impact from generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S.","In oncology, strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. Sales increased 92% worldwide and IMBRUVICA remains the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second line CLL and MCL. Outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience a strong adoption in Canada and the G5 and has recently launched in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. ZYTIGA sales grew 5.3% worldwide. In the U.S., market growth was essentially flat while market share was up almost 2 points sequentially. Sales outside the U.S. were tied to share gains in Japan and adoption in China since the launch in January of this year. DARZALEX continues to gain strong acceptance as a treatment for multiple myeloma and contributed approximately 2 points of worldwide pharmaceutical sales growth.","Turning to cardiovascular and metabolics, XARELTO continued strong share performance with TRx market share up 1.7 points versus Q3 of 2015 to 17.5%. Warfarin represents approximately 55% of the total market, down from 62% in the third quarter of 2015. XARELTO continues to be broadly reimbursed with over 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay. INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET sales declined 3%, with the U.S. down 8.7% due to an increase in price discounts. Some of the increase in discounts is attributable to higher co-pay program costs in the quarter. While the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin was up approximately 5%, TRx share was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2015. TRx share with endocrinologists was approximately 11% and approximately 6% with the primary care.","I'll now review the results of the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.2 billion increased 0.7%, with U.S. sales increasing 1.4% and sales outside the U.S. decreasing 0.2%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 3.1% worldwide, with the U.S. up 2.3% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Additionally, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide by 10 basis points and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points.","Growth was driven by Electrophysiology, Advanced Surgery, Vision Care and Orthopaedics, slightly offset by General Surgery and Diabetes Care. Electrophysiology within Cardiovascular grew 16% worldwide, driven by continued share gains in the U.S. and Europe as the atrial fibrillation procedure market increases. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by joint reconstruction and U.S. trauma. Pricing pressure continued across all major categories but was partially offset by positive mix in trauma and spine. Continued success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees and the CORAIL primary stem in hips contributed to the sales results.","Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew 14%, energy was up 10% and biosurgicals up 7%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, closed in the second quarter of this year, also contributed modestly to growth. Vision Care sales were higher by 5.5% worldwide as new products launched late last year continued on an upward trajectory across all regions. Worldwide General Surgery declined by approximately 2% due to discontinuing certain products in women's health and hernia, partially offset by both market growth and share gains in sutures. Competitive pressures and price erosion continued to impact Diabetes Care.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2016. To assist with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, to inform you about the state of the Pharmaceutical business and the progress made since our May 2015 Business Review Day. Joaquin?","Joaquin Duato","Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson. Our market-leading innovative medicines are the foundation of our strong performance, with a vast majority of their growth coming from volume gains.","We continue to pursue significant growth opportunities in terms of both penetration within existing indications and planned line extensions. Additionally, we have launched DARZALEX, the first of our 10 potential $1 billion-plus NMEs. As a result, we remain confident that we'll continue to deliver a strong growth through 2019 despite biosimilar competition and market dynamics.","Our success is a result of our strong track record of execution. Our industry-leading pipeline has delivered 12 NMEs since 2011 and eight breakthrough therapy designations since 2013. And for the fourth year, we are proud to have been named the #1 company in R&D and commercial productive innovation.","Our focused execution has delivered 11 in-market $1 billion-plus brands. 10 of these brands are growing and six of them are growing double-digits. Cumulatively, sales from our medicines launched since 2011 are the second highest of any pharmaceutical company. Our R&D and commercial capabilities are a proven strong foundation for future growth.","First, we will continue to focus on driving volume growth across our current market-leading brands through clinical differentiation. Second, we will accelerate the growth of these in-market brands through approximately 40 potential line extensions. Critically, 10 of these line extensions have more than $0.5 billion potential. Third, as we shared last year, we have a [indiscernible] pipeline investing in 10 potential $1 billion-plus NMEs, planned to be filed through 2019. Of these, we anticipate five to deliver significant growth opportunities in the near term. Since 2015, our expectations on these near-term opportunities have crystallized. Our latest information provides higher certainty that these products will succeed, delivering higher value than originally anticipated.","DARZALEX, launched last year, is significantly outperforming expectations. According to your own models, it is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar brand. Sirukumab has just been filed in the U.S. and Europe. Guselkumab has just had very positive data versus Humira presented at the EADV and we anticipate filing for psoriasis before year-end. Apalutamide has a broad clinical development program in both pre-metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer. We're also investigating it in combination with ZYTIGA and with our newly licensed PARP inhibitor, Niraparib. Finally, Esketamine is already in Phase 3 and recently received a second breakthrough therapy designation. Bill will provide additional clinical details on these near-term opportunities shortly.","Finally, it is important to note that these three strategies will prepare us to deliver robust growth beyond 2019, paving the way for more than 25 potential next-generation NMEs in the 2020 to 2024 timeframe. The strength of our in-market portfolio, complemented by our near term line extensions and NME launches will more than offset upcoming headwinds including those anticipated for REMICADE.","We are fully prepared to execute our focused biosimilar readiness plan. Yesterday, the launch of our U.S. biosimilar to REMICADE was announced for later this year. However, the appeals process is still ongoing and we believe any commercial launch of our biosimilar remains at risk.","Biosimilars are very different from generics. For example, in Canada, Australia and Brazil, where there is already biosimilar competition to REMICADE, we have maintained more than 90% volume share. Our U.S. commercial team is ready for a potential biosimilar launch.","I am confident in our strategy for three reasons. First, with no biosimilar approved for interchangeability, REMICADE's significant long-term safety data, a strong advocacy from patients and clear physician preference means that the 70% of patients who are stable on REMICADE are highly unlikely to switch. Second, our patient assistance programs provide a leading market differentiator. Third, we are confident that we can continue to provide a cost-effective option in all channels. The current market is extremely competitive and REMICADE's ASP is already significantly lower than the list price. Additionally, in developing innovative contracts, we can utilize the full breadth of our portfolio.","Our immunology franchise remains poised to grow through 2019. We have a strong market position and a deep near-term pipeline. Let me give you some examples. Already in rheumatoid arthritis, SIMPONI ARIA is the fastest growing IV product in the U.S. and has higher new-to-brand share than REMICADE. Outside of the U.S., we continue to gain share with SIMPONI too. Additionally, we plan to file two line extensions for SIMPONI ARIA in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Together, with the recent submissions of sirukumab for approval in the U.S. and Europe, we will further strengthen our leading position in rheumatology.","Turning to psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the #1 biologic in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and maintains clear share leadership in key markets internationally. One of our 10 potential $1 billion plus brands, guselkumab, is expected to provide a significant boost to our leadership in psoriasis and Bill will share more on this important upcoming filing.","Finally, moving to gastroenterology, the most exciting news is the recent launch of STELARA for Crohn's disease in the U.S. and its anticipated launch in Europe. There is tremendous unmet need in this debilitating disease. For example, 70% to 80% of Crohn's patients on anti-TNFs are not in remission at one year, and the patient population is expected to grow 50% over the next decade. This is the first in a series of line extensions, including UC, which will drive more than 35% of STELARA performance by 2019.","Moving now to cardiovascular and metabolics, INVOKANA continues to be a standout performer. Globally, it is the leading SGLT2 inhibitor and the third-largest non-insulin Diabetes medicine. Put into perspective, in the U.S., there have been more prescriptions filled for INVOKANA and INVOKAMET than all other SGLT2 inhibitors combined. A total of more than 1.3 million patients are treated in the U.S. alone.","As Joe mentioned earlier, INVOKANA's performance dipped this quarter due to temporary increased costs to administer co-pay patient access programs. However, I want to emphasize that this was a transitory event. Our return to growth will be driven by INVOKANA's strong access position across U.S. commercial plans and Medicare Part D and the recent approval of INVOKAMET XR. We are expecting our cardiovascular outcomes data to readout in mid-2017.","XARELTO is another market leader in our cardiovascular and metabolics portfolio, delivering double-digit growth every year since its launch in 2011. To date, XARELTO has already treated more than 3.8 million patients in the U.S. and is supported by an extremely robust published real-world data set, including evidence from more than 91,000 patients demonstrating consistency with our clinical trials. As a result, it is broadly reimbursed with more than 95% Medicare and commercial patients on formulary at the lowest branded co-pay.","These considerable achievements are just the start. Approximately 54% of potential patients are still utilizing Warfarin, presenting significant growth opportunities in current indications. Additionally, there are eight new indications seeking clinical studies underway as part of EXPLORER, the largest clinical development program within the anticoagulant space. If successful, the potential patient pool could increase more than five-fold.","Turning to neuroscience, INVEGA TRINZA is a growth catalyst for the entire long-acting therapy franchise. Not only is INVEGA TRINZA the fastest growing LAT in the U.S., it has also contributed to growing INVEGA SUSTENNA scripts 26% in the 13 months since launch. Significant opportunities for growth remain as only 11% of patients are treated with LATs in the U.S.","Celebrating 10 years of innovation this year, our HIV portfolio has achieved approximately 20% growth annually and cumulative sales of more than $15 billion. Today, 25% of patients in developed markets are treated with a J&J HIV medicine. Our class-leading portfolio has benefited more than 1 million patients and this legacy will continue with upcoming line extensions.","When Prezista first launched, it was part of a six-tablet regimen. The first upcoming line extension, Darunavir Single Tablet Regimen, will reduce this number to one, improving adherence and safety. Also, we expect two Rilpivirine fixed-dose combinations, one with Gilead\u2019s TAF and another one with ViiV's dolutegravir, that will drive additional growth post 2019.","Finally, let's move to our fastest growing therapeutic area, oncology. IMBRUVICA has led the recent growth of our oncology franchise, accelerating from a record breaking global launch to clear market share leadership in total patients in the first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Today, IMBRUVICA is reimbursing 41 countries with world-class market access. Since launch, an additional six indications have been approved and we anticipate an additional seven new registrations ahead, four of which have $500 million plus potential. Together with a number of promising combination therapies in development, these new indications will ascertain a very exciting future for IMBRUVICA.","IMBRUVICA's leadership in oncology is mirrored by our recently launched asset, DARZALEX. Only three months after its launch, DARZALEX became the number one prescribed therapy in fourth line or later multiple myeloma. From a launch aligned sales perspective, DARZALEX has continued to far outpace its competitors. This first-in-class medicine has since been approved in the EU and Canada and is driving positive share trends in earlier therapy lines in the U.S. We are confident DARZALEX can become the standard of care in multiple myeloma and help even more than the 10,000 patients who have benefited already worldwide.","Growth will continue to accelerate with the anticipated approval in second-line patient populations and the impressive data from the recently published CASTOR and POLLUX studies. An additional five Phase 3 trials are currently underway as well as development of a subcutaneous formulation. As Bill will detail, we have also seen some positive data that DARZALEX may be effective outside of multiple myeloma.","What should be clear today is that all of our current market-leading medicines have significant potential for continued volume growth. Additionally, we have a multitude of promising potential line extensions across every therapeutic area, approximately 40 in total, by 2019. Of these, 10 have more than $0.5 billion potential. The remaining 30 potential line extensions are not insignificant. Cumulatively, the line extensions for XARELTO and INVOKANA have the potential to drive $3 billion to $5 billion in incremental sales for the cardiovascular franchise. We believe these new indications will be a key driver of our growth through 2019, even in the context of biosimilars and market dynamics.","In my six years leading our pharmaceutical sector, I have never been more excited and more positive about our future as I am today. We have significant growth potential throughout our portfolio with market-leading brands, 40 anticipated line extensions, 10 of which have more than $0.5 billion potential, and 10 NMEs with more than $1 billion potential to be filed by 2019. Combined, these factors will ensure that we continue to outpace the industry growth through 2019.","It is now my privilege to turn the call over to Dr. William Hait, who heads up our R&D organization. Bill will provide additional detail about our pipeline that is set to deliver these groundbreaking treatments. Bill?","William Hait","Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait and I am the Global Head of Research & Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen we believe that by continuing to execute our current strategy, we will consistently deliver valuable products to patients with serious unmet medical needs and that this will sustain our leadership in the pharmaceutical industry.","Our strength is built on a blend of deep internal scientific expertise with industry-leading collaborations through the work of Johnson & Johnson Innovation. We continue to find efficiencies that produce savings that we invest in our pipeline and our strategic focus creates an enviable track record. We are delivering against our anticipated 2015 to 2019 NME and LE results that will produce a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. For these reasons and the results I will describe today, Janssen has become one of the most productive and most respected pharmaceutical companies.","Before I share with you the details of our pipeline progress, let me explain how and why we have been able to sustain industry leading results. Our five end-to-end therapeutic areas span basic drug discovery through launch and lifecycle management. This structure produces a focused seamless R&D organization, promotes efficient phase transitions and ensures dedication to major unmet medical needs where there is compelling translatable science. These five therapeutic areas concentrate on 11 high priority disease areas through our disease area strongholds, nimble and efficient biotech like teams embedded in the broader context of the therapeutic areas.","Each disease area stronghold undergoes rigorous triennial review by our external Scientific Advisory Board, receives a priority score and proportional funding of discovery and early development. Our therapeutic areas are supported by substantial research capabilities through our Centers of Excellence, including biotechnology, medicinal chemistry, diagnostics, clinical operations and most recently oligonucleotide and nucleic acid chemistry expertise garnered through the acquisition of Alios.","Assets that transition into late development are prioritized into three categories to ensure that our investment of resources align with our most promising targets. Currently, our top two categories, which represent 40% of our assets and 80% of our overall late development value, receives 60% of our investment. It is through this approach that we remain at the top of the industry in successful phase transitions and speed to market.","Janssen has achieved considerable success and we are poised to continuously deliver near and long-term growth. Our balanced investment across all aspects of our pipeline allows us to enjoy a constant flow of important new data. We launched 12 new products since 2011. We received the most FDA approvals from 2011 to 2016 as well as eight breakthrough therapy designations. For four consecutive years, we have been named the Innovation Leader by IDEA Pharma and became the partner of choice to the work of J&J innovation. And for the third consecutive year, Fortune Magazine ranked Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson #1 in the pharmaceutical category on its annual World's Most Admired Companies list.","Our unwavering commitment to global public health is demonstrated by SIRTURO, the first new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis in over 40 years, as well as the work on new convenient HIV combinations, the first prime-boost Ebola vaccine using Crucell's adenoviral vector and Bavarian Nordic's MVA vector as well as new chewable forms of Mebendazole for children with worm infestations.","As Joaquin mentioned and as we highlighted at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review Day, between 2015 and 2019 we plan on filing approximately 10 new drugs, each with the potential for greater than $1 billion in peak year sales and 40 line extensions. This slide highlights 10 LEs anticipated to be filed in the 2015 to 2019 time period with peak year sales potential greater than $0.5 billion. In addition, our early pipeline is rich in important assets that have the potential to file between 2020 and 2024.","We are on track to deliver our anticipated NME and LE results through a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. Since May 2015, we garnered three new product approvals and filings with a fourth, Guselkumab, anticipated this year, and we achieved 16 significant line extensions.","Now, let me use our time together to describe in greater detail some of the progress we have made since our May 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. Oncology is the newest of our five therapeutic areas and achieved industry-leading growth based on our development of several first-in-class drugs, including ZYTIGA, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX.","Our hem-malignancies disease area is anchored by IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. IMBRUVICA, the first BTK inhibitor for the treatment of certain B-cell malignancies, received four FDA breakthrough therapy designations. IMBRUVICA was recently approved for front-line use based on the unprecedented results in previously untreated CLL patients reported in the RESONATE-2 Study published in the December 15th issue of The New England Journal. As shown in this slide, treatment with ibrutinib decreased progression or death from CLL by 84% compared to chlorambucil and demonstrated a similar improvement in overall survival.","DARZALEX, the first monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, received two FDA breakthrough therapy designations and was approved almost four months ahead of its PDUFA date in double refractory myeloma. As shown on this slide, combination therapy with DARZALEX delivered impressive results in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. The CASTOR and POLLUX studies demonstrated that the addition of DARZALEX to Velcade and dexamethasone or Revlimid and dexamethasone respectively produced a greater than 60% decrease in risk of progression or death as compared to that of VelDex or RevDex alone. Both of these studies were published in The New England Journal. This month, the FDA granted priority review for Daratumumab in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone or Bortezomib and Dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma with a PDUFA date in February 2017.","Our prostate cancer disease area is anchored by ZYTIGA, the first CYP17 inhibitor for the treatment of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and is approved for both pre and post chemotherapy indications. Furthermore, we are developing ARN-509, now known as apalutamide, a more potent next-generation androgen receptor antagonist that shows a high degree of safety and efficacy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. As seen in these figures, apalutamide decreased PSA by a median of 85% in patients with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer every 12 weeks of treatment. The maximal PSA response, shown in the right-hand figure, was achieved in 94% of patients.","Earlier this year, we licensed Niraparib from TESARO to obtain a highly potent and selective PARP inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with DNA repair defects, for use in combination with ZYTIGA or apalutamide. Niraparib is in Phase 2 clinical trials and currently planned to be filed by 2019. This portfolio of assets gives us confidence that we will continue to bring great results to patients with prostate cancer for many years to come.","While we did not explicitly address immuno-oncology during our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review, we continue to make significant progress in this area. Over the last five years, we invested in four critical areas, including vaccines, T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell redirection and myeloid mechanisms of action. We currently have 15 immuno-oncology assets in development, including eight that are in the clinic.","Recently, we uncovered an important additional mechanism of action of DARZALEX to be immune-mediated through the depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid and lymphoid populations including a previously unrecognized super-suppressor CD38 positive T-reg population as well as activation of CD8 and CD4 positive effect to T-cells. These results provide the impetus for exploring DARZALEX in indications beyond hem-malignancies and solid tumors.","Our immunology therapeutic area continues to deliver extraordinary products for patients with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. STELARA was the first IL-12, IL-23 monoclonal antibody introduced for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. It was recently approved in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the U.S., received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, and offers new options for adult patients with IBD.","Guselkumab is a first-in-class selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated significant efficacy versus placebo and superiority compared with the anti-tumor necrosis factor, adalimumab, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The VOYAGE study, whose results are shown in this slide, randomly assigned 750 patients to receive Guselkumab, adalimumab or a placebo followed by Guselkumab in a 2-2-1 ratio. Patients treated with Guselkumab achieved a significantly greater chance of attaining a PASI 90 score compared to that of patients treated with adalimumab or placebo at week 16, and the advantage over adalimumab was sustained through week 48.","The high degree of efficacy of Guselkumab, the less intensive dosing regimen and the potential for a STELARA-like safety profile makes Guselkumab highly competitive with newly launched anti-IL-17 antibodies. We plan to file for psoriasis this year and advance Guselkumab into Phase 3 for patients with psoriatic arthritis.","Neuroscience is a historically strong area for Janssen since Dr. Paul Janssen and colleagues developed haloperidol, the first medication for schizophrenia. We have built on Dr. Paul's legacy with the development of next generation antipsychotics and pioneered the development of long-acting injectables that help improve compliance with this difficult to treat patient population, most recently with the approval of INVEGA TRINZA in every three-month injectable formulation.","Today, we focus on neuroscience investment in drugs that treat serious mood disorders, including depression, suicidality and Alzheimer's disease. Esketamine, an intranasally delivered enantiomer of ketamine, produced groundbreaking results in major depressive disorder, with onset of action measured in hours to days rather than weeks to months.","There is an alarming increase in suicides, both in the U.S. and globally, more than 41,000 each year in the U.S. alone. It's a tragic issue that's emerging as a major health priority. As shown in this slide, Esketamine ameliorated suicidal ideation within four hours and sustained this effect for over three weeks, leading to its second FDA breakthrough therapy designation.","Infectious diseases is one of our most exciting and important area of investment for future growth where we focus on respiratory infections and hepatitis. We are pursuing an aggressive strategy for the cure of hepatitis C. We recently reported a 100% SVR12 in patients with genotype 1 with both an eight and six-week duration of treatment using a 3DAA combination of OLYSIO, AL-335 and odalasvir. Based on these exceptional data, we are moving to 3DAA regimen into late development studies.","Our cardiovascular and metabolism therapeutic area developed both INVOKANA and XARELTO in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe and Bayer respectively. New line extensions are designed to continue to bring value to these two first-in-class drugs.","With XARELTO, we are pursuing studies in congestive heart failure, embolic stroke of undetermined source, VTE prevention in medically ill patients, infrainguinal peripheral artery disease, VTE prevention in cancer patients and in acute coronary syndrome. We anticipate readouts from two INVOKANA cardiovascular outcome studies by mid-2017, which we believe will further strengthen the importance of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in the treatment of patients with diabetes. We are also studying the role of INVOKANA in diabetic kidney disease and plan to address obesity and pre-diabetes.","In summary, at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are executing a clearly defined innovation strategy that drives value to patients around the world. We are on track to meeting our anticipated results described in 2015. We are producing a cadence of transformational innovations that are leading to exceptional results. We are a leader in productivity, approvals and FDA breakthrough therapy designations, and we are one of the fastest growing top 10 pharmaceutical companies.","We have had the most U.S. FDA approvals in the last five years, 2011 to 2016, and eight breakthrough therapy designations. We anticipate filing approximately 10 NMEs between 2015 and 2019, each with greater than $1 billion peak year sales potential. We have approximately 40 planned line-extension filings anticipated between 2015 and 2019, several with greater than $500 million in peak year sales potential, supported by a steady flow of clinical data that drive better patient results. Finally, we take pride in delivering years of life saved and better quality of life for our first Credo responsibility to the doctors, nurses and patients who use our products.","Now, before I turn it over to Dominic, for your reference let me leave you with the current overview of our pipeline across our five therapeutic areas. Dominic will now continue with an update of the Company's financial results.","Dominic J. Caruso","Thank you, Bill and Joaquin, and good morning everyone. As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we made good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. With great leaders like Joaquin and Bill, our strong end market performance driven by excellent commercial capabilities and our robust R&D pipeline, you can see why we remain confident that our Pharmaceuticals business will continue to be a major driver of growth moving forward.","I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're pleased with our overall results. As you know, we had a strong start to the year, and as a result, last quarter we increased our sales and earnings guidance. I'm happy to say we're tracking with those higher expectations while continuing to invest in our business. As you've heard, our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong results this quarter with underlying operational growth of 10.7%. Let me now provide some comments on our other businesses.","In our Consumer business, we continued to gain share this quarter. However, as reported by Nielsen, the industry saw slowdown in many markets with category growth rates in 2016 about half of the category growth rates we saw in Q3 of 2015. As Joe noted, our sales growth for the quarter was also impacted by lower trade inventory levels. These lower levels are the result of inventory builds in Q3 2015, as we discussed at that time, due to re-launches of certain products as well as inventory reduction programs being implemented at some of the larger retailers this past quarter. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, and this overall impact with trade inventory reductions, overall Consumer growth was nearly 4%. Based on increasing share trends of our brands, we expect trade levels to align with consumption going forward.","In Medical Devices, consistent with some recent analyst reports about the market, we believe the industry experienced lower hospital admissions and procedure rates during the mid summer months. Late in the quarter, several reports showed higher levels of activity, and in fact the data that we recently saw published for September looked encouraging. Additionally, we are very pleased to see our priority platforms continue to deliver robust growth of nearly 9%, with some at double-digits as Joe mentioned earlier. Overall, Hospital Medical Devices operational growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 4% this quarter. In the Consumer Medical Device businesses, we saw continued price erosion in our Diabetes business. However, in our Vision Care business, we saw good operational growth of 5.5%.","So in summary, as we previously discussed, in 2015 our underlying operational growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days that we saw in 2015, was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continued to accelerate our growth and we delivered strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 5.9% for the third quarter of 2016. Our sales were above analyst estimates, as were earnings, due to significantly higher pre-tax operating margins.","As you may remember, our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis point increase in our 2016 pre-tax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We have attained that level year-to-date while continuing to invest in our business and we remain comfortable with that forecast for the full year as we continue to execute on the restructuring activities in our Medical Devices businesses while also investing in growth.","As you know, in September we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics. We expect this transaction to close in Q1 of 2017. So, for 2016, the transaction is expected to have no impact to our adjusted earnings and is not expected to impact our guidance. For 2017, again assuming a Q1 close, the transaction is expected to be positive to sales growth and immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. We are excited about Abbott Medical Optics' strong and differentiated surgical ophthalmic portfolio, particularly in cataract surgery. That, coupled with our world-leading ACUVUE contact lens business, will help us become a broad-based leader in vision care.","Now, I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the remainder of 2016. So I'll now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2016.","Our operational sales growth this quarter was 4.3%, and when we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, the impact of hep C sales and the overall impact the Venezuela had, it was strong at more than 6%. If you direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items.","As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the intangible amortization expense of about $250 million and the anticipated special charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring plan. Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by first call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.8% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same, as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year.","Now let's take a few moments to talk about other items of the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 30 basis points, mostly due to unfavorable transaction currency impacts, partly offset by a favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 290 basis points lower, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, due to overall good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, lower by 40 basis points, due primarily to lower milestone payments, partly offset by increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipeline.","Our pre-tax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32% or 310 basis points higher than the third quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, our pre-tax operating margin is defined as gross profit, less selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and less R&D expenses. As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progress throughout the year, and through nine months we have achieved a 220 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability, consistent with the expectations we communicated to you throughout the year.","Interest expense, net of interest income, was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $50 million in the quarter, compared to a net expense of approximately $400 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million, compared to a net gain of approximately $400 million in the prior year period which included a higher level of gains from divestitures.","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7%, compared to 20% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit which was passed by Congress late last year and it reflects the current mix of our businesses and the impact from a new accounting standard relating to the tax benefit on share-based compensation which we discussed in our call in July.","Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise improved by 220 basis points versus the third quarter of 2015. You will note a significant improvement in margins for the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical businesses. Last year, our Consumer business benefited from a gain on the sale of SPLENDA and you're seeing that reflected in their lower margin this quarter, although still at very healthy rates.","As you can see on the next slide, on a year-to-date basis, we are pleased to see solid improvement in our Consumer margin and we remain confident it will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full-year 2016 as compared to 2015. Overall, we expect adjusted income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in pre-tax operating profit margin which I noted earlier more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015.","Now, I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. I'd like to start with some of the items that we know you find difficult to forecast. Let's start with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $13 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt.","Through the end of the third quarter, we completed nearly 60% of our $10 billion share repurchase program and we expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million. This is a slight tightening of the range.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains or losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corp., divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a gain ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the underlying activity. This impact will be offset by a lower tax rate.","And now for taxes, we're very comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 18% to 18.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance primarily due to a higher level of income in lower tax jurisdictions.","Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. Our sales range for 2016 continues to remain the same, whether or not a biosimilar REMICADE launches this year in the U.S. Additionally, we do not anticipate biosimilar or generic competition this year for PROCRIT, ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, but as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo.","As we've done for several years, our guidance will be first based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","We continue to be comfortable with the sales guidance we provided last quarter, reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisition, divestitures and hepatitis C, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year even after adjusting for the shipping days in 2015 which we mentioned earlier.","Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1% on sales growth. This is consistent with our previous guidance as major currencies had not significantly fluctuated since our last update. So, after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of positive 2% to 3% or a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion, consistent with our previous guidance.","And now turning to earnings, as a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.71 and $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 8% to 9%, and this is a narrowing of the range.","If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, the negative impact to EPS would be approximately $0.03, consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.68 to $6.73 per share, which again is a narrowing of our previous guidance with a midpoint that is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance range.","Finally, just a reminder of some dynamics you will see in our fourth quarter results this year in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2015, we had additional shipping days based on when our year-end closed, and that contributed approximately 4 points of sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter last year, we closed on the Cordis divestiture, and based on our latest guidance for 2016, we will have significantly lower level of other income from divestitures as compared to the prior year.","In closing, we are very pleased with our performance so far this year and we remain confident and optimistic about our future full-year growth for 2016. Specifically, we are expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, a higher level than we experienced last year on a comparable basis. Our adjusted pre-tax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. We narrowed our guidance and increased the midpoint for adjusted operational EPS growth, which remained strong in the range of $6.71 to $6.76 per share, with a growth rate of 8% to 9%, and we are very well-positioned to seize the opportunities in our strong pipelines to continue fueling our future growth.","Now I'd like to turn things back to Joe for the Q&A portion of the call. Joe?","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Dominic. Michelle, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to participate in the Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","So Dominic, I wanted to focus on the 2017 puts and takes. Dominic, in our Healthcare Conference in September, you said the only real delta from 2016 to 2017 is the rate at which biosimilar REMICADE could penetrate the market, assuming Pfizer launches at risk and you don't think the penetration will be dramatic. I took that to mean that you feel that you can grow sales in 2017 at a similar rate to 2016 minus the impact from biosimilar REMICADE. So my questions are, is that the right interpretation and what gives you the confidence that this level of growth will continue? And second, the biosimilar for Neupogen captured about 7% of the market in year one. Would you expect Inflectra penetration to be less than that? Any color that you can give on the expected penetration would be helpful, and I did have one follow-up on Pharma. Thank you.","Dominic J. Caruso","Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question. I think the way you characterized it is accurate, that excluding the impact of any biosimilar launch, we would expect the business to grow at a rate similar to what we saw this year in the Pharma business overall, as well as I think we will see improved performance in the Medical Devices business and we're seeing continued share gains in the Consumer business. So I think that is a good way to characterize it. We'll provide more color on that when we talk about the 2017 guidance in our discussion in January.","We do think that the rate of penetration for a biosimilar will be modest. I know several reasons for that. As we talked about before, 70% of the patients are treated well with REMICADE. There is no interchangeability available, that's another factor. And we're already in a highly competitive environment with respect to biologics, anti-TNF therapies, as you know. Before any comments on Neupogen, Joaquin, anything else you want to add to overall penetration of biosimilars?","Joaquin Duato","We are confident that we have our readiness plan for our biosimilar launch in the U.S. What we have seen internationally in markets like Australia, Brazil where we market REMICADE is that our volume share has been in excess of 90%. So that is consistent with what you described. We are confident that we have a strong plan based on what Dominic described before, there's been 2.6 million patients treated with REMICADE worldwide, there is no interchangeability and there is a clear patient and physician preference. So it's highly unlikely that you're going to be seeing patients that are stable in REMICADE to switch it. So that is 70% of the patients.","At the same time, we have a strong patient assistance program which will prove to be a market differentiator and we are ready to compete in every channel trying to bring patients the most affordable option in every situation. So we feel well-prepared to face the biosimilar, and as Dominic said, we are convinced that we will continue to grow our business in the face of biosimilar competition.","Dominic J. Caruso","And Larry, I'm not sure whether Neupogen is a good analog or not. I mean, who knows, right. Obviously, we have Europe, we have a biosimilar in Europe that Merck is responsible for marketing I think there over about a two-year period. Merck has retained about 75% share. So that's one analog. You had a follow-up question you said on Pharma.","Larry Biegelsen","Yes, maybe for Joaquin. So on INVOKANA, I saw in the presentation that you expect to present the CANVAS and the CANVAS-R data in mid-2017. So my questions are, are you going to present CANVAS and CANVAS-R separately before mid-2017 and did you have any plan to issue a press release with top line results before the presentation? And lastly, what's your confidence that we'll see a similar cardiovascular benefit as we did with EMPA-REG OUTCOME as well as the lack of significant amputation risk? Thanks for taking the questions.","Joaquin Duato","INVOKANA remains the leading SGLT2, as I have described in the conference call, and to talk about CANVAS and CANVAS-R and the cardiovascular benefit, I'm going to pass the question to Bill.","William Hait","This is Bill Hait. So we plan to evaluate CANVAS and CANVAS-R together as one net analysis. We're in discussions right now on the degrees of statistical confidence with the FDA. We have very strong reason to suspect based on CANVAS that the combination will give data very similar to what was reported with EMPA.","Operator","The next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","I was just going back to I guess REMICADE and just again through the pipeline I guess, what are some of the things that you feel confident on to the extent that the biosimilar could take I guess greater share than what you are expecting that could start to fill-in I guess some of the gaps from that perspective?","Joaquin Duato","I described part of the reasons for optimism during my conversation before. We not only feel that we are going to be able to grow in the face of biosimilars in the pharmaceutical business overall, but we also are confident that we're going to be able to grow our immunology franchise in the face of biosimilars. Let me give you some examples of why going into the three segments, rheumatology, psoriasis and gastroenterology.","In rheumatology, SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA are doing very well. As a matter of fact, SIMPONI ARIA is already leading in new-to-brand share in rheumatology in the U.S., and SIMPONI is gaining share in all international markets. We plan to file two line extensions of SIMPONI ARIA in ankylosing spondylitis and in psoriatic arthritis by 2017, and also we just filed sirukumab with EMEA and we plan to file it here in the U.S. before the end of the year. So that gives us a strong confidence that we're going to continue to grow in rheumatology.","Then moving into psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the leading in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and it's leading in most markets internationally. Together with that, we plan to file Guselkumab that we have presented very impressive data at the last EADV. We plan to file Guselkumab before the end of the year. So that's another reason why we feel real confident that we will continue to grow in psoriasis.","And finally gastroenterology, which by the way for us is the largest and fastest-growing segment, we just had the approval of STELARA in Crohn's disease and we are now launching it in the U.S. and we anticipate to be launching it in Europe pretty soon. So that is another reason which we believe that we are going to be able to continue to grow in immunology.","So overall, we have line extensions, we have continuous penetration and also we have the filing of sirukumab and Guselkumab in the second half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan.","Michael Weinstein","So Dominic, I wanted to just follow up on all the discussion on the Pharmaceutical business. You made some comments at an investor conference in September that caught my attention. You talked about the five major therapeutic categories the Company is in today, and you opened up I think for the first time that the potential of the Company would consider adding a new therapeutic category. Just want to get a sense of your interest in doing that, and maybe the rest of the team wants to chime in as well.","Dominic J. Caruso","Sure, Mike. I remember that discussion pretty well. I just want to put it in the context for everyone. So this was a discussion about the success of our Pharmaceutical business, which has largely been driven by collaboration, licensing, co-development, et cetera, and not at all by any major acquisition, right. And the question that I got posed to me was, well, that's been very successful, why would you ever change that or is there any reason to consider a change in that strategy?","And my comment was, to the extent we have five major therapeutic areas today, if we decided that another major therapeutic area was of importance to us and we wanted to get into that therapeutic area and we felt we could add a lot to it based on our overall scientific knowledge more broadly, that I would see that perhaps being done not by necessarily a licensing strategy but more of an acquisition type strategy. So it would enhance the overall portfolio of Johnson & Johnson's Pharmaceutical business beyond the current therapeutic areas that we currently are in, and by doing that, that might require a more significant acquisition than we've been doing in the Pharma business. So that's the context for that.","Joaquin Duato","What is important to remember is that our focus is in medical innovation, and therefore our areas in which we'll operate will depend on where science is going and our own internal capabilities on the development on the commercial side. So, from that perspective, we are constantly evaluating in which therapeutic areas we are in and its affluent situation. The focus is in transformational medical innovation and the actual therapeutic areas can change over time.","Michael Weinstein","And so, is that \u2013 I mean, Dominic, that comment, is that just an indicator of that there is an open-end sort of interest in new therapeutic areas more so today than maybe in the last five years?","Dominic J. Caruso","I think there's always an interest in new therapeutic areas where there is medical innovation where we think we can make a difference to patients in the health care system. So I'm not sure that that's changed dramatically, although over the last several years, we've built these very prominent disease strongholds within the therapeutic areas that we have today and obviously they take some time to build. Bill, any other comments on that?","William Hait","In fact, to get to where we are today, we had to focus down from approximately 33 different diseases we were investing broadly but thinly to 11 diseases where we developed extremely deep expertise internally, from basic discovery right through launching, commercialization and market understanding, to where we are always considering first, is there a room for further massive innovation because of the development of transformational science or new knowledge that we can go after. And number two is, we become very familiar with adjacencies to the areas we are in, and if they look attractive, they are often the ones we take the hardest look at. So we are always looking to see if there's still massive innovation left to go in our disease areas and therapeutic areas and we're always looking closely at adjacencies.","Operator","The next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Two questions, first for Joaquin and then Dominic, some commentary on Medical Devices utilization. So Joaquin, I found your commentary on the strategy to defend REMICADE pretty compelling. So, should we take from your comments that your existing strategy is sufficient or should we expect more proactive pricing strategies to emerge in 2017 and beyond?","Joaquin Duato","Our strategy is three-pronged, as I described. The first one is the fact that we believe based on the track record of REMICADE and the lack of interchangeability, it's unlikely that patients are going to switch if they are stable. So that's a very important component for us. The second element is that we plan to compete in all channels, and in planning to compete in all channels, we are going to be utilizing innovative contracting and utilizing the full breadth of our portfolio. And then finally, we plan to utilize market differentiators such as patient assistance programs that are going to enable affordability. So with these three components, we feel confident that we are going to be able to have a very strong plan to face the biosimilar.","The second element of that overall is what I just described before, what are the elements that lead us to believe that we'll continue to grow in immunology too, and I described the different line extensions and NMEs that we have in the three areas, rheumatology, gastroenterology and psoriasis. So combined, we feel strongly that we'll be able to continue to grow in immunology and overall the Pharmaceutical business will grow in the face of the biosimilars.","David Lewis","Okay. So if you had to use price next year more aggressively, Joaquin, that would be an incremental surprise to you?","Joaquin Duato","This is already a very competitive market as it is today. As you can imagine, there is already significant competition in the market today, both in the subcu area and in the IV area. So we believe that the level of discounting that is today makes it already a high bar for any new entrant.","David Lewis","Thank you, very clear. And then Dominic, you made a series of comments on utilization. I just want to clarify both the near-term and kind of longer-term environment. So if I heard you correctly, it seems like there was some softening potentially in the Medical Devices business in the summer but that got better in September. I wonder if you could just help us out in terms of how you would characterize the environment here in September and entering into October. Is it stable with what you saw in the first half of the year or different? And then the second part of that question is, you also said, in 2017 you actually expect some improvement in the Medical Devices business, and maybe you could share with us your confidence level and the areas that you would expect to improve in 2017?","Dominic J. Caruso","Sure. So what we saw, David, is that through published sources, many of which are from firms such as yours and many of the sell-side that publish, we saw actually utilization rates as depicted in hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures with the first quarter of this year being the highest by far and then a slowdown in the second quarter, a slowdown even below the level at which most estimates were depicting or forecasting. And then the third quarter was even slower than the second quarter overall but with a very marked difference in September.","So once September hit, the data showed quite a rebound from the summer months, and the rate of growth in September was actually faster than what we saw in the first quarter, which was the highest growth quarter year-over-year in terms of penetration. Now whether that remains at that level or whether it's a rebound effect from the summer, we'll have to see. But I think this is all well-chronicled in the multiple reports that many of you I'm sure have seen. So overall, I'd say we're now in a stable environment in hospital procedures.","Going into 2017, I expressed confidence in our Medical Devices business growing faster, and quite frankly, you know we have a plan for that business to return to growth at above market for the Medical Devices sector and it's continuing to improve. What gives me confidence there is that the area that we focused the most on, the growth platforms and priority platforms, just this quarter they grew at 9%, and within those, three of those in particular, electrophysiology, energy and endocutters, each grew at double-digit growth. So we obviously have very robust growth coming in the priority platforms, which we expect to continue and drive us to above market growth in 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Just a follow-up on REMICADE, because Dominic, you said REMICADE, where the biosimilars would be a launch risk, so can you remind us what's next in the legal process? And then you also did a good job of discussing the impact you thought for the top line. Can you talk about the profitability of REMICADE today? Is this a drug that is still heavily marketed? I can't imagine there is a lot of R&D behind REMICADE.","Dominic J. Caruso","A couple of things where we stand on the legal front, as you know we have an upcoming trial on the media related to the production of the biosimilar and that trial is scheduled for mid-February of 2017, and we're also appealing the ruling recently in the Massachusetts Court regarding the patent being invalid, and that will proceed. But we're also separately, and we had been involved in this process for quite some time, we're continuing the appeals process within the U.S. Patent Office and that process has several more steps to go. Joe, anything else you want to add to that?","Joseph Wolk","Yes, just with some specific dates, Glenn. So the oral arguments in front of the PTO was heard on September 28. We expect that decision to be rendered anywhere from one to three months. In the courts, on the 471 patent, the final judgment just came from the bench on September 27. So that triggers the time in which we have to appeal, and we are going through that process now.","Dominic J. Caruso","Okay, and with regard to profitability, obviously the product like REMICADE is an important product that obviously delivers significant profitability to the Company, but of course we have a number of new launches. We have some that are already launched and are progressing and rapidly growing and their relative cost does not grow at the rate of their sales growth, and overall we have to manage through this period of time when eventually when a biosimilar launches and a patent expires, we'll have to prepare ourselves for that in any event.","So we are very well prepared to adjust accordingly, and as you know, our major focus always is to grow our sales at a rate faster than the rate in which our markets grow, so gain share, and then grow our earnings at a rate faster than sales. So that's the level at which we plan for each and every year.","Glenn Novarro","So is there some restructuring that may come out over the next, announcements that may come out that could serve as an offset to REMICADE and any potential lost profitability?","Dominic J. Caruso","We don't see any major restructuring related to the REMICADE situation on the horizon, Glenn, not at all.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Dominic, just a couple of questions for you. With the upcoming election, obviously it's been a major area of focus for healthcare investors. I'm just curious to your thoughts on Proposition 61, and as you know, I think that polls are showing that that actually might pass in the state of California, and just curious to know what you think the industry's response will be to that. And then secondly, I'm interested in your thoughts on the potential for an international tax reform as part of an infrastructure bill. Obviously, you would be huge beneficiaries of such a bill because of repatriation. Can you give us your thoughts on the likelihood of that happening? We had multiple discussions over the years about tax reforms, which never happens, maybe it will happen this time, just curious to know what your Washington folks are saying. And are we correct in assuming that if you were to do a large mega transaction adding that sixth tool to your Pharmaceutical division, are you more likely to wait until we get visibility on that or is your decision irrespective of potential legislation? Thanks.","Dominic J. Caruso","Okay, Jami, let me take a minute and reverse a little. So whether or not we do a major transaction, we'll not be dependent on waiting for international tax reform. Obviously we have plenty of borrowing capacity and obviously any transaction that's done outside the U.S. would be an effective use of that OUS cash. And as you know, we've had the benefit of being able to structure transactions and effectively use our OUS cash in a tax efficient manner and we did that [indiscernible] transaction, we've done that recently with the two transactions that we recently announced.","With respect to international tax reform and what we're hearing, I can tell you that I visit in Washington often and speak with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee and the tax staffs are busily working and working very collaboratively with U.S. multinationals on an appropriate tax reform package. We think there is more [by-parts] [ph] to support now than there has been in the past. We think that often we hear, as you mentioned, the benefit of investing in U.S. infrastructure as a result of those repatriated earnings coming back into the U.S. So that would be a positive. And we think that overall the climate for international tax reform post the election, quite frankly, is more positive than it's been in the last year or so.","And then with respect to Proposition 61, there are several opponents to that proposition and we would prefer to have pricing that is more related to outcomes. Evidence-based medicine is something that we are advocates of, and therefore, outcome-based pricing is a logical consequence of that. But Joaquin, any other thoughts on Prop 61?","Joaquin Duato","Thank you. I mean as you were saying, Dominic, despite of the rhetoric about pharmaceutical pricing, it's always good to take some perspective on that. Pharmaceuticals represent 14% of total expenditures and we understand that we need to work with different stakeholders in order to try to manage our healthcare cost and we have advanced different ideas in that area as you were describing, Dominic, such as value-based contracting, and we need to work there in order to try to eliminate the regulatory barriers that do not help in that area.","As far as Proposition 61, as an example of that rhetoric, as Dominic said, there are different groups that oppose that measure that includes even veteran groups and seniors and unions, the reason being it's unclear what the effects of Proposition 61 would be. It is clear that it would be difficult to operationalize and also would create some access barriers to patients. So overall, we don't see Proposition 61 as the right way to try to work on pharmaceutical pricing. We think it's a misguided action.","Joseph Wolk","Being respectful of everyone's time, we'll take one more question, Michelle.","Operator","Our final question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS.","Matthew Miksic","I have one just quick clarification here on REMICADE, and then I have one on sort of capital allocation. So Dominic and Joaquin, if I could just make sure I'm understanding your comment on pricing and expected biosimilar competition. As you've gone through a number of times here on the call, the perception is that REMICADE pricing will face some kind of new downward pressure or abrupt pressure here as a result of this launch. It sounds like what you're saying is, the net price for the drug is already quite competitive. There will be obviously penetration but it doesn't sound like you're expecting to see any kind of significant or abrupt changes in pricing because of the competitive launch. Is that a fair characterization of what you're saying?","Joaquin Duato","I think you got it right. All drugs, all medicines face price pressure. This is a particularly competitive market as it is today and we think that the price level is already quite competitive. So I think you characterized the situation quite right. I think the competition is going to move into other discussions such as other market differentiators, but the market is already quite competitive as it is.","Matthew Miksic","Got it. Thank you. And then on capital allocation, just broadly speaking, Dominic, as we get this question quite often, you've made a number of comments throughout September about the kinds of things that you would be interested in strategically. You of course have said previously you'd be interested in ophthalmology and you are now pursuing that. If you wouldn't mind just for the record kind of ticking through your major divisions, and just I think you've touched on Pharma already, your preference there, but maybe on Consumer and Devices, just remind us the kinds of things that you are still interested in, their size and maybe area?","Dominic J. Caruso","Matt, as a broadly-based company in human healthcare, we have an equal amount of interest across each of the businesses, and the way we compensate for that is basically looking at an appropriate risk-adjusted return for the particular assets that we're interested in, and that is the same even regardless of size. I mean, obviously size matters for a couple of reasons. One is that the asset may be well understood, the business may be well-penetrated, the premium required for the asset may be excessive, and therefore to generate value for our shareholders would be a challenge, but it doesn't mean we wouldn't try to do that or we wouldn't look for areas where that may in fact be available for us. So that would be across any of the businesses.","Within Consumer and Medical Devices in particular, Consumer, just like we have in Pharma, we have specific areas of focus. We have 11 need states. The primary focus for us is growing internationally in emerging markets, so strong brands in emerging markets. A focus on over-the-counter medications and the beauty space particularly in Asia are of interest to us. We just did a recent transaction with Dr.Ci:Labo in Japan where we have an interest in that Asian marketplace and utilizing that brand throughout broader, throughout Asia beyond Japan where it's currently marketed, just as an example of one.","In the Medical Devices, as you know we have a very strong presence in orthopaedics and in general surgery. We keep looking for additional bolt-on acquisitions there and we have a very strong electrophysiology business in cardiovascular but there are other areas within cardiovascular that seem attractive in structural heart and other areas, but the valuation would be something we'd always consider. So we'd also be very disciplined about doing a transaction where the valuation seem pretty high, which is what they are today.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you for the questions, Matt. That concludes the Q&A. I will now turn the discussion back over to Dominic for some closing remarks.","Dominic J. Caruso","Okay. Thanks Joe. As I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our overall performance this quarter and we are tracking well through the second half of the year. I would like to thank Joaquin and Bill for their outstanding leadership and for the great presentation they gave this morning about the continued progress we are making in our pharmaceutical business. I would also like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to updating you on our full-year results in January. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. I'm pleased to discuss with you our solid results for the second quarter, and how our performance during the first half of 2019 positions us well for the rest of the year and beyond. During the quarter, we continued to deliver growth across the three segments of our broad-based business, while also optimizing our portfolio and making progress against long-term strategies. ","Revenue and earnings per share were in line with our expectations. As expected, we did experience sales deceleration from the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of generic and biosimilar competition in our Pharmaceutical business. Income in the first half of 2019 provides us the opportunity to continue investing to fortify, accelerate and potentially add to our pipelines across all three segments. We are committed to driving solid financial and operational performance for our shareholders, while also delivering on our responsibilities to patients, employees and communities as outlined in Our Credo. Chris will provide additional franchise and product detail, but let me provide some high level framing. ","Our Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver strong growth across our oncology, pulmonary hypertension and immunology portfolios. We are particularly pleased with the success of DARZALEX, STELARA, IMBRUVICA and the INVEGA portfolio. As highlighted during our May pharmaceutical business review, our performance demonstrates our ability to consistently obtain approval from new products and line extensions. Once again, our performance was driven by volume of transformational medicines that address high unmet medical need rather than price. ","In our Consumer segment, we accelerated growth in the second quarter in our stronghold beauty lines of NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. We are also pleased with the contributions from newly acquired businesses DR. CI:LABO and ZARBEE's. This growth more than offset the one-time impacts related to seasonality and inventory levels we mentioned during our first quarter call. We expect to deliver competitive growth relative to the market for the year. ","In our Medical Devices segment, we did incur some isolated supply disruptions in the quarter, which Chris will outline and the impact limited growth by 1 point. Accounting for that, we grew about 4% in line with last quarter, and we are on track towards our goal of exceeding last year's performance. We continue to enhance our leadership positions in platforms such as electrophysiology, energy and endocutters. Orthopedics grew modestly during the quarter in line with Q1 led by hips and trauma. That being said, we remain intent on improving our performance in orthopedics and the segment at large. ","Turning to earnings, earnings per share was favorably impacted by a significant gain recorded in other income. Specifically, the approximately $2 billion pretax gain related to the sale of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. We closed this transaction in early April. And as mentioned during the first quarter call, this gain comprises a large majority of our other income guidance for the full year 2019. ","Other income for 2019 is on par with levels experienced in 2015. And consistent with past practice, we intend to utilize these gains to invest in opportunities that increase shareholder value and better position the business for long-term success. ","I will now turn the call back to Chris to discuss second quarter sales drivers as well as highlight notable line items in our P&L before I return with some comments regarding our cash position, capital allocation priorities and guidance. ","Chris DelOrefice","Thank you, Joe. Worldwide sales were $20.6 billion for the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of 1.3% versus the second quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 1.6% as currency had a negative impact of 2.9 points. In the U.S. sales decreased 2.2%. In regions outside the U.S. our reported growth declined by 0.3%. ","Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 5.5% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.7% worldwide, flat in the U.S. and 7.6% outside the U.S. ","Turning now to earnings. For the quarter net earnings were $5.6 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.08 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.45 a year ago. Excluding the after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.58, representing increases of 21.5% and 22.9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 25.2%. ","Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the second quarter highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2018, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. ","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion growing at 4.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.3%, with strong growth in the U.S. of 4.4% due primarily to strong performance in our beauty franchise. Growth outside the U.S. was 0.7%. Consumer continues to grow its share in the e-commerce channel. Outpacing category growth rates in that channel with strong double-digit growth across all regions. The beauty franchise grew 10.7% or about 5% adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of DR. CI:LABO and the NIZORAL and ROC divestitures. ","Our priority brands NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance results due to share growth combined with strong sales in our club and e-commerce channels in the U.S. Share growth in NEUTROGENA was realized in the facial moisturizing treatment and sun protection categories. ","AVEENO was further aided by retail stocking for the hair products launch, OGX and MAUI MOISTURE brands continued to experience solid growth, really resulting from new market expansions. ","Over-the-counter medicines grew 2.8% globally, or 1% when adjusted to exclude the impact of ZARBEE's acquisition, which continues to perform well. In the U.S., OTC adjusted operational sales growth was just over 2% and is growing share. However, the U.S. was negatively impacted by retail inventory factors. ZYRTEC was a core contributor of sales growth and grew market share. Additionally, children's MOTRIN and TYLENOL in pediatric analgesics delivered strong sales and share growth. Adult TYLENOL also continues to drive significant share growth with consumption well outpacing the category, realizing double-digit consumption growth driven by rapid release gel, and TYLENOL arthritis products. ","However, TYLENOL sales declined slightly this quarter, as its consumption was more than offset by the lapping of the supply disruption associated with Hurricane Maria and the sell-through of 2018 elevated retail inventory levels that occurred in response to seasonal and other retailer stocking dynamics.","Concluding on Consumer segment, Baby Care grew 2.2% globally. Growth was primarily due to lapping retail destocking and other events associated with the Johnson's Baby relaunch in the U.S. The Johnson's relaunch is stabilizing performance in all markets where it has been relaunched. ","Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.5 billion grew 4.4% enabled by double-digit growth in nine key products. Sales were aided by one-time favorable pricing adjustments outside the U.S. worth almost 100 basis points worldwide, primarily driven by DARZALEX. Sales declined in the U.S. by 2% and increased outside the U.S. by 12.9%. Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U.S. growth by about 300 basis points and 500 basis points respectively. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at competitive levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds. ","Our oncology therapeutic area delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.1%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing about 57% globally, or about 41% when removing the impact of a favorable one-time adjustment related to the completion of pricing and reimbursement discussions in certain European countries. The U.S. grew 24% and continues to benefit from strong market growth, and about a 3 point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy. The continued strong double-digit growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains across the 40 EMEA countries where it is commercially available, as well as Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Of note, just last week, we filed a regulatory submission for the subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX for multiple myeloma in the U.S. ","IMBRUVICA grew over 39% globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. along with strong uptake outside of the U.S. and the European and Asia Pacific markets. In the U.S., based on first quarter data across all indications and lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 3 points of market share, and continues to be the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which gained almost 8 points of market share in line one therapy. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 20% with declines of 59% in the U.S. driven by generic competition, which was partially offset by growth of about 25% outside the U.S. ","Strong sales growth in Europe and Asia were driven by market growth and share gains primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer, based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. In non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, which gained 4 points of market share in U.S., with the penetration of prescribers split almost evenly among urology and oncology practices.","We are also pleased with the early launch progress in EMEA, where ERLEADA is now available in five countries. During the quarter we filed regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Further, we are pleased with the early launch progress of BALVERSA for the treatment of adults with locally or advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. ","Our immunology portfolio delivered global sales growth of just under 6% driven by continued strong performance in STELARA with growth of 18%, primarily from the Crohn's disease indication. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease where market share has increased by over 6 points in the U.S. compared to the second quarter of 2018. ","Sales growth is partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 15% due to increased discounts, and modest share loss in the U.S. to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars. ","Lastly, TREMFYA totaled $235 million globally, and is experiencing strong demand with over 35,000 patients on therapy. TREMFYA achieved a 7.6% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up 3 points from the second quarter 2018. ","In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 5.4% led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and JULUCA for HIV partially offset by cannibalization and increased market competition in other products. ","In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing about 16% with higher market share, driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, we are pleased with the launch performances SPRAVATO for treatment resistant depression. There are more than 1,600 sites certified with the REMS program and new treatment centers are being added daily. ","In our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 14.7% primarily driven by declines in XARELTO, INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO continues to increase TRx share. However, the share uptake was offset by the increase in the legislative rate for the donut hole from 50% to 70%, along with higher Medicare and donut hole utilization resulting in an overall decline in XARELTO of 19% this quarter. ","We've seen a positive response to XARELTO's new 2.5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD and PAD indication. And while we expect the penetration of this expanded patient population to recur over time, we are confident in the value this indication provides to patients. ","Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by 6% with strong performance in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI growing by about 15% and 19% respectively on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. This growth was partially offset by TRACLEER which is negatively impacted by the recent generic entry in the U.S. as well as continued generic competition outside of the U.S. ","I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.5 billion, declining 4.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of LifeScan and ASP, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.2% worldwide. ","As Joe mentioned, we did have some isolated supply challenges in the quarter that negatively impacted growth by about 100 basis points worldwide. Adjusting for this, Medical Devices would have delivered growth of just over 4% consistent with the first quarter and a representative of the continued progress being made to improve performance in this segment. ","Interventional Solutions grew about 16% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business achieving more than 16% growth worldwide continuing its trend of double-digit growth. Growth was strong in all regions, driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. ","Additionally, we delivered a fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth in the CERENOVUS business driven by new product innovation, including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke as well as strong market growth. ","Vision growth of 1.5% was driven by contact lenses which grew almost 3% globally led by daily disposables and astigmatism lenses in the OASYS family. Our contact lenses business remained strong with year-to-date growth of just under 5% in both the U.S. and OUS. Orthopedics growth remained consistent versus Q1 of 2019 with growth of 0.6% or 0.9% when adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and selling days. We continue to make progress to improve growth in this franchise and we remain committed to executing our innovation and commercial plans that aim to improve performance. ","Hips grew 3.3%, which we expect to represent above market performance globally, driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach and continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS, which is now our number selling stem in the U.S. ","Additionally, our KINCISE Surgical Impactor designed to replace the handheld mallet is enabling hip procedures in the U.S. ","Trauma growth of 1.7% globally was driven by market growth supported by strong adoption of newer innovation such as our Femoral Recon Nails. The U.S. growth rate of 3.3% is expected to be in line with the market and accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. Growth outside the U.S. was flat when adjusting for selling days and was also impacted by over 1 point due to timing of a tender shifting to the second half. ","Spine declined over 2% with the U.S. being the primary driver of the decline. Our U.S. growth was flat when adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and selling days while we continue to see some stabilization of performance driven by new products such as a VIPER PRIME System for minimally invasive surgery and EXPEDIUM VERSE our all-in-one pedicle screw system for deformity. We continue to pursue opportunities to further improve growth including new innovations such as the Symfony system we plan to launch in the second half in complex cervical.","Knees declined by less than 1% in the quarter with the U.S. being the driver of the decline. Offsetting strong growth of over 5% outside the U.S., it is expected to represent above market performance led by new innovation, including ATTUNE Revision and S+. The U.S. market is realizing positive uptake from the ATTUNE Revision System but we continue to have portfolio gaps which we are addressing to enhance performance, including the expected full commercial launch of our Cementless offering later this year. ","Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics but was relatively stable overall compared to Q1. For the quarter U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms. Spine price pure price declined approximately 4% with hips, trauma and knees all down about 2%. ","Turning to the results for the surgery business. Advanced Surgery delivered global growth of just over 6% led by strong performance in both energy and endocutters primarily driven by share gains and new products in the Asia-Pacific region. ","Biosurgery declined by over 2% due to a stopped shipment of SURGIFLO in the U.S. which impacted global biosurgery growth by 11 points. We will continue to work with the FDA to ensure this important technology for patients is available again in the U.S. market as soon as possible. ","Wound closure will grew approximately 3% as conventional and barbed sutures gained share. Across total general surgery worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 250 basis points due to a field action on our Intraluminal Staplers. Corrective actions were taken in the quarter and we began distributing to customers in June. ","Selling days had a minor negative impact on our global growth rates in the second quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact in any subsequent quarter in 2019. ","There\u2019s a final comment on Medical Devices based on feedback we received from the analyst community. We will no longer be providing utilization trends during this call. These estimates were based on limited external data and provide a low correlation to our actual market performance in the segments we compete. For the final update on utilization, we did want to provide you the latest figures for Q1 since we shared estimates last quarter. Hospital admissions, surgical procedures and lab procedures all increased by approximately 1.5%, 1% and 1.5%, respectively. ","I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2019 please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 second quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.3 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion.","Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.58, an increase of 22.9% versus the second quarter 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.63, up 25.2% versus second quarter 2018. ","I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings, compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by product mix, which was offset by improvement in selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter as a result of leverage in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer business. ","We continue to invest in R&D at competitive levels and our investment in research and development this quarter as a percent of sales was 13%, which is higher than the second quarter 2018 by 30 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by higher investment in our Medical Devices business to support the development of our digital surgery platforms, including robotics. The increased levels of income recorded in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by the gain on the ASP divestiture. ","Net interest expense was lower by $132 million, primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps. ","Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate of 20.4% was in line with the second quarter 2018 of 20.5%. We encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.3%, compared to 18.5% in the same period last year. The second quarter of 2019 includes the tax impact on the gain of the ASP divestiture. ","Now looking at adjusted income before tax. In the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise increased from 33.7% to 41.9% in 2019, primarily driven by the gain on the divestiture of ASP. ","The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment: ","The decrease in Pharmaceutical margins by 160 basis points was primarily driven by product mix and lower other income. Consumer margins also decreased by 480 basis points, because of lower divestiture gains that were partially offset by leveraging in selling and marketing expenses. Medical Devices increased from 27.8% to 57.5% in 2019, due to the gain on the ASP divestiture partially offset by investments in digital surgery. ","That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s second quarter 2019. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter. Some of which were mentioned in my comments. ","I will turn the call back to Joe. ","Joe Wolk","Thanks, Chris. With respect to cash, at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $14 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $15 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $29 billion of debt. These levels are similar to the first quarter. We\u2019ve simultaneously executed across all four tenants of our capital allocation strategy, which are designed and have proven historically to drive shareholder value. ","Reinvestment in our business remains a top priority at Johnson & Johnson. We invested $2.7 billion in research and development in the quarter, which as Chris mentioned, represents a 30 basis point increase relative to net trade sales from the second quarter of 2018. ","Regarding investment in inorganic opportunities, we closed the acquisition of Auris health, and we continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further enhance our portfolio. We also used cash in the quarter to continue returning value to shareholders. As announced in April, we increased our dividend for the 57th consecutive year to $0.95 per share, distributing $2.5 billion to shareholders in the quarter. ","We also acted on our authorized $5 billion share repurchase program in the quarter deploying $2 billion for that purpose. We are now slightly above 75% complete with the authorized program. ","I will now provide a few comments on the updates to our guidance for 2019. Our results for the first half of the year have given us additional confidence in our sales performance for the full year. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for operational sales growth by 50 basis points to a range of 1.0% to 2.0%. We are also increasing and tightening our operational sales growth adjusted for acquisitions and divestiture guidance to a range of 3.2% to 3.7%. The estimated impact of translational currency of 200 basis points has remained the same as our last update, although we are not predicting the impact of future currency movements. ","Regarding adjusted pre-tax operating margin, we now expect adjusted pre-tax operating margin for the year to slightly decline, as we are planning for investment in innovation that adds to, solidifies and accelerates our pipelines. One really good example of this is our recent acquisition of Auris Health, which I just mentioned. Our opportunities to invest in digital surgery capabilities, coupled with other strategic investments in support of acquisitions, such as DR. CI:LABO are estimated to equate to about $0.10 of dilution. However, we have absorbed impacts like this in our current guidance. ","For net interest expense, we are lowering the range to between zero and $100 million due to the favorability that Chris described in his earlier remarks. We are increasing our expectations for other income, the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from items such as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs .We have more certainty given that we are halfway through the year and having closed the Advanced Sterilization Products transaction, we are comfortable increasing and tightening the range to approximately $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, increasing the midpoint by $200 million compared to our prior guidance.","Regarding our effective tax rate. We are increasing our effective tax rate guidance to a range of 17.5% to 18.5%, which includes the updated impact to tax associated with the Advanced Sterilization Products divestiture gain. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance for 2019.","The operational EPS guidance represents strong growth of over 7% at the midpoint, which is approximately 2 times our adjusted operational sales growth, while simultaneously increasing investment levels to fortify our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business. ","We do not provide quarterly guidance. However, to better inform your modeling, I will provide a few qualitative factors to consider near-term. We expect the largest impacts from generics and biosimilars for the year in our pharmaceuticals business to occur in the third quarter. This is primarily driven by expected U.S. ZYTIGA accelerator erosion as well as the comparison to the highest growth quarter in 2018. ","Also, U.S. TRACLEER and U.S. PROCRIT as well as VELCADE outside the U.S. expect accelerating erosion, driven largely by generic entries in new markets and additional competitors. Also, in the third quarter of 2018, we had the favorable impact of the U.S. baby pipeline replenishment due to the relaunch, which will not repeat. ","Lastly, as I mentioned, we are taking the opportunity to incrementally invest a higher level of divestiture gains. Most notably, we plan to increase investment in our pipelines, and therefore, we would expect our R&D spending to be higher in the second half of the year. ","Before I hand the call back to Chris to begin the Q&A, let me take a moment to thank Joaquin and Paul for being part of this call today, as well as our 135,000 global associates for their hard work and dedication. Without whom our continued success would not be possible. ","Chris, let's begin the Q&A portion. ","Chris DelOrefice","Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. As a reminder, I would encourage you to take advantage of Joaquin and Paul being on today's call by directing questions to them about their areas of expertise. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much for the questions. I guess my first question was just on the EPS guidance. You've steadily raised top-line growth this year. We haven't seen your earnings move that on much higher. I know you talked about some investments. But can you just elaborate a little bit more on this dynamic. So specifically, is this mostly kind of R&D going into the device business or is it across your franchises? And should we think about this as a sustained higher level of investment or more of a kind of a one-time step-up this year? My second question is -- quickly was on XARELTO. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the dynamics that are resulting in this kind of sharp decline we saw in the quarter? I guess the heart of this is, are we seeing Part D dynamics that are worse than you anticipated for that franchise? Thanks so much. ","Joe Wolk","Hey, Chris, this is Joe Wolk. Thanks for your question and good morning. With respect to EPS, I'll address that and then I'll turn it over to Joaquin to address the XARELTO question. With EPS, we are looking at the back half as investing more heavily in R&D as we've consistently done for a number of years now. When we have the opportunity to divest a business where we recognize an appreciable gain, we always look to turn that back into the business whether it's for our current pipelines to fortify or solidify those, as well as to add on to our pipelines. The investment is spread I would say primarily across Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals at this point. That's the plan. If you think about what I said in some of my prepared remarks with Auris and the acquisition there, that was an additional investment that would have been dilutive of about $0.10. We've absorbed that. And so that's kind of some of the examples that I could give you. Earlier in the year, you may recall, we also did a deal with Argenx for CD70. We're going to look to continue to do things like that inorganically, as well as within our own pipeline to see what we can accelerate and bring to the market a little bit earlier for patients. Joaquin you would like to take the XARELTO question?","Joaquin Duato","Thank you. Thank you for the question. First, this was a strong quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group with operational growth of 4.4% on very robust volume growth of 7.8% and especially very robust and strong OUS growth with 12.9%. So very positive quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group with nine products achieving double-digit growth. Specifically when you look at the underlying growth that is when you exclude U.S. ZYTIGA our growth was 7.6%. So, that is a good position for us moving into the rest of the year, and especially moving into 2020, when we anniversary the U.S. loss of exclusivity. ","Moving to XARELTO. The first thing is that we continue to see XARELTO is a very important driver of growth for the Pharmaceutical Group. The decline that you see in the quarter, as was explained already, is related to higher cost for patient access due to channel mix changes particularly more sales in PHS, [BDD] [ph] and Part D and also higher statutory rebates in the donut hole. We expect that we will be able to come back to positive territory once we anniversary these factors. Where is the growth going to come from once we do that? It\u2019s going to come first through continued volume and share growth in VTE and in AFib.","Second, we will continue to reach more patients through our CA\/PAD indication, which is tracking aligned with our cardiovascular drugs, launches like ENTRESTO or BRILINTA. ","And finally, we continue our indication expansion through new indications such as VTE prevention in medically ill patients that we filed in the fourth quarter of 2018. So, overall, we continue to see XARELTO as a growth driver for the Pharmaceutical Group. We expect to be in positive territory once we anniversary those factors. And we will leverage the fact that XARELTO has the most complete set of indications, the largest safety data generating clinical trials, particularly in higher risk patients. And the most real world living experience with more than 6 million patients treated in the U.S.","Chris DelOrefice","Chris, thanks for the questions. I guess wanted to short build on Joe's commentary. Just as a reminder in Q1, we took our adjusted ops guidance up $0.05 that was offset by currency. And another acquisition investment I think is a good example is DR. CI:LABO as well, that we've covered the dilutive impact there. ","Next question please.","Operator","The next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Maybe Joe, just a quick financial one for you and then I'll focus on pharma. So just considering your commentary on spending, your other income very strong in first half of the year as expected. But as you look into 2020, that's obviously a headwind. In prior annual periods, you used SG&A as a factor to offset any other income headwind. So are you comfortable as you head into next year that is supply chain reduction, some of the easing of exclusivity issues still creates an opportunity for levered earnings in 2020? ","Joe Wolk","Yes. So, David, thanks for the question. Good morning. I think that's a great question, when we get off and with respect to the level of other income that we've had. You'll notice that today's guidance reflects pretty similar to what we experienced in 2015. And when we went into 2016, we didn't skip a beat in terms of improving our operating margins. We were able to leverage SG&A as well as to have a healthier top-line. That is the outlook. We're not providing guidance, obviously for 2020 on today's call, but that is certainly the outlook and the expectation for our business moving into next year. ","So, maybe to parlay some of the answer for Chris' question, is this a new level or not? We've challenged the teams to look for value creating opportunities, and we're planning for higher levels of investment. Should those not materialize, obviously, we would come back and revise guidance accordingly. But right now, we think we serve patients as well as shareholders best by looking for those opportunities. When we don't have those divestitures gains, there may be a need to scale back. We also appreciate our commitment with respect to earnings expectations as well. But we will manage for the long-term. ","David Lewis ","Right Joe, very helpful. Then maybe for Joaquin I had a quick question on pharma, maybe a two part question. But many of the balance for J&J has been headwinds versus some of the pipeline tailwinds. In the next quarter or so, really going to see the full effect of ZYTIGA. We've already seen effect of REMICADE. So it does feel like in the next quarter or so Joaquin, the Pharmaceutical business does -- should begin to accelerate and that acceleration should be sustained into 2020. One, is that how you see the business here in the next quarter or so? And then secondarily, can you just give us an update on where we sit with the esketamine launch in terms of [center ads] [ph] and how that launches tracking relative to the expectations? Thanks so much. ","Joaquin Duato","Thank you for the question, Dave. As I said before we see a strong underlying growth in the Pharmaceutical Group of 7.6% in the second quarter as we saw also strong underlying growth in the first quarter. So as we anniversary, in particular U.S. ZYTIGA LOE, you're going to see the underlying growth coming to the forefront and that predicts for a positive 2020. The drivers of this growth are on one hand a slower ZYTIGA erosion that we had anticipated, but most importantly, what you are seeing is a nice strong performance of our core brands. As I said before, we had nine brands growing double-digit in the second quarter. So that is how we see it similar to you see it too. ","When it goes to SPRAVATO, we are working to be sure that we make it available for centers, physicians or patients as SPRAVATO was approved earlier in March. And we are excited about the therapeutic gap that is going to fill in treatment-resistant depression. We've created a model that is addressing all the areas to ensure appropriate use and distribution. We have a controlled distribution model. We have a REMS certification program and also it\u2019s a medicine that is self-administered but under physician administration with an observation period. So far, we have already 1,600 centers that have been certified and we continue to have great interest from the psychiatry community and the patient community in this treatment alternative. So we remain very positive of all the opportunities for SPRAVATO. Overall we're very positive about the opportunities that our pipeline have and the opportunities that we will be afforded in the coming years for continuing to be reaching more patients and perhaps this maybe a real opportunity for Paul to discuss what are the opportunities that we have in the pipeline in the short run. ","Paul Stoffels","I can add something there Joaquin. We expect at the moment a pipeline of 14 medicines which can exceed to $1 billion by 2023 and reaching millions of patients. And there is a significant opportunity there to increase -- grow to new indications, increase penetration and share but also of new formulations that we have seen with DARZALEX subcu. In addition we expect 40 line extensions with more than 10 having a potential to exceed $500 million.","And at the same time going forward to your integrated, we're integrating disease areas and pathways and leveraging new technologies, cell therapy, gene therapy, data science and you will also see the first vaccines and with that continue to seek also the best signs in term of external. Our R&D portfolio is not one which comes together by chance, it's very well designed the way we do as we focus on differentiated medicines and vaccines, year of life, quality of life is the first metric before the business comes, sourcing selective and agnostic early mid and late stage and then we apply excellent in-development with time, quality and differentiation as the main drivers.","And with that we have been able in the collaborative space to become a partner of choice. We have the pharma R&D review you can go back to the website and have review there, the material is all still on there for all the details but let me highlight a few of the very transformational products we have in the pipeline. We have the CAR-T which we licensed from Legend in 2017 now advancing fast. We took it over start of the Phase 1 last year and now we're entering into Phase 2b and with the data generated we expect to file in the range of 2021 and the ongoing study in China continue to perform very well and that gives us lot of confidence where at the movement three years in 88% of patients achieved an overall response rate and 74% achieved a complete response. So more data will be presented by the end of the year. ","The new -- also new in our pipeline is cusatuzumab the anti-CD70 which will start earlier which we acquired from Argenx, again an investigational product for AML and that is a CD70 antibody and there we anticipate starting a Phase 2 later in the year. We also acquired three very interesting gene therapy products which represents a new platform for us in retinal disease and there the first for us is a first entry into gene therapy and positioned to be first in markets with best-in-class assets. ","And last but not least that we\u2019ve introduced -- also a new space for us with the vaccine portfolio where we are entering with an RSV vaccine now in late stage development in older adults. But also as we announced this week, we're going to progress with an HIV vaccine which is already ongoing in Africa since two years, where we did a Phase 2b and now we start with the study in the U.S., Latin America and the Europe where we will test the HIV vaccine in high risk and MSM and transgenders. And hopefully with that, getting just a few highlights to you on the pipeline. ","We continue to build on our current pipeline with significant line extensions for expansion as well as I just was telling building on the new pipeline going for the future.","Chris DelOrefice","Thanks, David, appreciate the questions. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So apologies to Paul and Joaquin, I\u2019ve got two for Joe. So Joe, first the fundamentals of J&J have been good. But the talc and opioid litigation have been overhangs for the stock. How do you move past those two issues? What are the milestones we should be looking for? And what are your messages to investors? And I have one follow-up. ","Joe Wolk","Sure. So thanks for the question, Larry, good to speak with you. So let me take those separately. With respect to talc, as you know, and as we've said many times on this call and many other forums that we've known for decades, and it's been validated by many other agencies that are highly respected that the product is safe, we also know that the company act to responsibly, so we'll continue to pursue defense of the company's actions as well as the product going forward. ","The next major event I'd say starts in a few weeks here July 22nd to be specific, related to multi-district litigation, known as Daubert hearings, here in the State of New Jersey. That is not a ruling per se. It's a determination of evidentiary standards. So what evidence the point is, need to present what would be acceptable, and it covers about 85% of the outstanding cases. So we're obviously preparing very thoroughly for that. Again, when folks have a chance to really look at the facts in these cases, they see that the product is safe at the company act to responsibly. ","As you know, and as we've also said many times, that even when a verdict goes against us originally, we often prevail on appeal. So we'll continue to fight that one. ","With respect to the Oklahoma and the opioids litigation, a similar dynamic in that the facts simply just don't align to what the state is claiming. And so what do I mean by that? The facts specifically are is that based on Oklahoma's own Medicaid reimbursement records, not just for a period of time, but for the last 20 years, less than 1% of the reimbursement occurred for Johnson & Johnson products. ","Johnson & Johnson's products were designed to prevent abuse. Even the state's attorneys in this case, have said multiple times as I understand it throughout the proceedings, that this is not about Johnson & Johnson's products, it's about the opioid epidemic. We agree this is an epidemic with opioid addiction. However, it's going to be multiple factorial in terms of the solution set and it's going to require many sophisticated parties to make sure that we've got the right remedies in place for people who suffer from that.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks, Joe. And just to more quickly follow-up, just vision is being a bright spot for devices with both contact lenses and surgical growing above average, but this quarter was soft in both areas. Why was that and what turns those around? Thanks for taking the questions. ","Joe Wolk","Great. Good observation, Larry. So I would say vision has been very strong for us. We have had for a number of years now great cadence of innovation. I think it's really turned around that business from where it was earlier this decade, our latest innovations around transition lenses, which is being very well received in the marketplace.","The contact lens performance and the underlying demand continues to be strong. I would say there were some inventory adjustments that were required, we thought it was going to be more of a hard Brexit which impacted some of the first quarter levels of inventory. So we're comfortable on the contact lens side. ","On the surgical side, we're seeing a little bit softness specifically in the U.S., outside the U.S. it\u2019s still fairly strong with some of the IOL lenses and the innovation that we introduced here about a year, year and a half ago. In the U.S., cataract and refractory are both a little bit softer from a market perspective. And we have to improve the innovation cadence there as we move into 2020.","Chris DelOrefice ","Great. Thanks, Larry. Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Just one for me, just on the area of digital surgery and robotics. I was wondering, if you could just provide us with an update on where you stand across the various business units in those efforts, specifically with the Verb products, what your kind of current thinking is around the opportunities with Auris and then also Orthotaxy? Thanks so much.","Joe Wolk","Great, thanks for the question, Kristen, nice to speak with you. So I'll start, but I'll probably turn it over to Paul as well to talk about each of the specific platforms. But maybe it's appropriate at the outset just to take a step back to provide kind of an update to our overall digital surgery strategy inclusive of the robotic enabled surgery for and endoluminal orthopedics as well as general surgery. ","So as I mentioned earlier on the call, we're very pleased with the Auris Health acquisitions, it\u2019s off to a great start. Not only did we get some great products there and some great technology. But we secured one of the pioneers with respect to robotic surgery and Dr. Fred Moll and his team. So they're currently looking at and assessing all of our platforms. We think it's prudent of us to utilize that expertise to look at not just what we're doing for the Monarch platform in lung cancer and bronchoscope but also to take a look at Orthotaxy and as well as our partnership with Verily to see how we can make sure that it's not a matter of coming to market fast, but coming to market fast. ","And so we want to make sure that we've got a differentiated product, one that competes with the current product offerings that are out in the marketplace for the next three, five, 10 years down the road. So that's how we're approaching it. Our timelines have not changed with Orthotaxy specifically, we're still progressing towards a 2020 media regulatory submission. We feel that that's very much on track. As you know, with the acquisition of Auris, we are on the market with their Monarch platform. And we continue to make great advancements with the Verily partnership. But, Paul maybe I can turn it over to you to talk about some of the finer points on what the technology can offer?","Paul Stoffels ","Thank you, Joe. Let me start with Auris, which as Joe said this is off to a great start with great acquisition. The Monarch platform is currently on the market for the diagnosis of lung cancer. And that is part of a broader lung cancer initiative in the company where we both look at early diagnosis as well as early intervention. And with an existing marketed platform that accelerates activity in that space very much. ","But furthermore, the possibilities of the endo -- in endourology we\u2019re probably targeting a 90% stone free in a single treatment is within reach, as well as a very significant opportunity in GI endoscopy gives us a very strong start in the robotic space with the Monarch platform. The eye platform from Auris is a very, very attractive space which has more reach and more different positioning possible and all discovering all of the different interventions. So that's where we are aiming for finally. ","If you look into Orthotaxy, we continued to receive great feedback about that platform, especially about its smaller footprint, the fact that it is an imageless system, and the surgeon\u2019s freedom to move within the cutting plain defined by the robot. So -- and that resulted in an overall ease to use, which is greatly appreciated by the surgeons.","And finishing up with Verb, as you expressed the confidence in the platform and the value proposition, we recently successfully completed a series of end-to-end procedures, engaging a group of global KOLs across a subset of target specialties including general and with hernia, colorectal and bariatrics in urologic, in gynecologic and thoracic surgery and we continue to believe our system will address the current limitations of robotic surgeries such as access and reach, the footprint and cost and the workflow and advanced instrumentation to such a much better outcome. I was personally able to operate one of the instruments in the lab and it's really a very impressive new robotic surgical tool. And also overall, the surgeons, their feedback continues to be very positive on the product. So overall, a very good start. Hard work for us and lots of developments to be done but on a very good path.","Chris DelOrefice","Great. Thank you, Paul. Thanks Kristen for the questions. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn ","I was wondering, on the R&D spend, you mentioned on the pharma side, it sounds like that ramp is mainly external opportunities, but I was wondering if there is any internal programs that you're going to be ramping spend on, if you can be more specific there? And then on DARZALEX any insight you can provide on average treatment duration now and how you see this evolving over time and then any initial thoughts on how you're thinking about pricing the subcu formulation? Thank you.","Joaquin Duato ","Let me start with DARZALEX. I'm telling you that we are very pleased with the progression of DARZALEX. We had a very strong growth in the quarter, with 57%, 41% when you neutralize for the one-time price effects. So we are pleased with the progression -- with the operation of DARZALEX and the strong growth that we are having across all lines of therapy. Particularly, recently we had two important events. One is the approval of the front line indication in eligible patients in the combination with REVLIMID, which was much anticipated and that will give us together with the filing of the also front line indication in transplant eligible will give us three indications in front line.","So to your question on the duration, as we move into earlier lines, the duration of the treatment increases. When it comes to the subcu that we filed earlier this week, we think it is a very important opportunity for DARZALEX overall. Keep in mind that we're going to be able to reduce the infusion time from eight hours that we have today to five minutes. So that's going to give significant advantages in terms of adoption of DARZALEX, in particular it mainly aligns particularly when you think that 50% of the use of DARZALEX today in the US is in oncology clinics in outpatient patients. So we think that this combination is going to make DARZALEX easier to use for physicians, more convenient to patients. If you add to that the number of studies in which we are showing very strong results in front line will pertain for a very positive continue adoption of DARZALEX that we see one of the major drivers of the growth of the Pharmaceutical Group.","Paul Stoffels ","With regard to the spending internal or external, once we bring in an asset internally, we consider it all as internal spending. The external spending we do is on milestones and that has been an upfront and that has been a very effective way to create value for us. We do less acquisitions, but we invest a lot in external innovation in early stages through collaborations through our JLABS and also through our venture capital and through acquisitions. But once we acquire products, it becomes part of a portfolio and we continue to drive the success of that.","We have a significant number of internal derived opportunities, let's say, at the moment in the range of 50-50, 60-40 of products coming from our own portfolio as products which we brought in and we invest also something like 50-50 in new products but also as Joaquin was saying, in line extensions. Line extensions are great opportunities to have de-risked products and get additional indications and additional access to patients which grow products faster. And that's why you see us doing on good assets very extensive developments very fast so that indication after indication we can bring to the market.","That grows a product. Look at DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, now ERLEADA just to name a few. The next generation of TRINZA with a six month so we build on de-risked products also as well as on new platforms as I indicated earlier, with the gene therapy, cell therapy and the new assets which we brought in.","Joaquin Duato ","Another area, Terrence, where we are making significant investments is seen in data sciences. We are trying to embed data sciences in everything we do across R&D, to both accelerate discovery and early development and also to improve late development. For example, we are using data sciences to better understand disease expression and progression and also to be more effective at molecular invention. Now, we have models to accelerate molecular design of enemies for high priority targets across all our therapeutic areas. In late development, we are also using data sciences to do a step change in the efficiency in which run clinical trials and also to create synthetic control arms and better stratify patients. So we are embedding as I said, data sciences and making significant investments to be bilingual both in science and in data science.","Terence Flynn ","Great. Thank you, Paul and Joaquin.","Chris DelOrefice ","Thanks Terrence for your questions. Appreciate it. Operator, next question.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch ","I have a specific question and then a big picture one. Specifically, you talked about 100 basis points of supply issues in Medical Devices. I was curious if you could share which devices were impacted and if that's been fully resolved at this stage?","Joe Wolk ","Joanne, thanks for the question. So there were two that were mentioned. Obviously, our first priority is patient safety. One has been remediated and the product is actually back on the market and that's related to our circular staplers. So there was a manufacturing lot that we pulled off the market. Again, it's been remediated and everything is back in order. The second was, during a routine FDA inspection through a third party manufacturer, which is manufacturing SURGIFLO for us. They went through the regulatory filing, identified a change in the manufacturing process. So they were just seeking more information. We're working fully with the FDA and expect that to be resolved shortly.","Joanne Wuensch ","Then my big picture question has to do with the lay of the land in healthcare and how you're looking at patient volumes and pricing and then quoting with that, how are tariffs impacting the business? Thank you.","Joe Wolk ","Okay. I'll start maybe, and maybe I'll turn over to Joaquin and\/or Paul to give you some further insights. But with respect to tariffs first, I would say that, we've had modest impact on our business, nothing that's noteworthy. If you look specifically where most of the rhetoric and dialogue has occurred, it's been around China. Our business in China across all three of our segments has been very strong, high-double digit growth, mid teens or higher across all three segments. So we really haven't seen that impact.","With respect to pricing, the Pharmaceutical results, again, I think we would all agree, are very strong and that is in the face of net prices declining by 6%, similar to what we saw in 2018. So in the US strong growth. We've got generic and biosimilar erosion and we've got about 6% price headwind, yet the transformational portfolio continues to deliver for patients as well as for our business results. I don't know Joaquin if you want to add anything around the pricing dynamic.","Joaquin Duato ","Pricing, we see continued price erosion, which is a dynamic that we have seen in the US market for the last couple of years, which we, as we have commend earlier, more than offset with our volume growth. And overall, we don't see that trend changing. What we think is that in that context, we are positioned most favorably than the rest of the companies because of three reasons. One is the diversification of our portfolio. We had in 2018, 11 medicines of more than a $1 billion. So we are present across many therapeutic areas. Also, we have payer mix which is very similar to the overall market. We don't over index in any particular payer.","The second thing is that, we have a very robust volume growth. And this volume growth, which is driven by the share that we are gaining and the penetrations through new indications, more than offsets that price adoption. And finally, we do have a strong presence OUS. 45% of our sales are OUS and in this quarter, for example, our sales OUS grew 12.9%. So, overall, we do believe that if we are able to continue to do what we do exceptionally well, which is bringing new breakthrough medicines to patients, we are very well positioned in this context of price erosion.","Chris DelOrefice ","Great. Thank you. Thanks Joanne for your questions. Next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy ","Just a high level question on devices. I mean based on our math on a comp adjusted basis, you saw another quarter of growth acceleration. I'm just wondering if you could comment on, are we past the trough now in devices and how much of the healthy growth this quarter came -- what was J&J specific versus perhaps a uplift in the various different market growth rates?","Joe Wolk ","Yes. So, great questions Danielle. Yes. We do think that the trough is behind us with respect to Medical Devices. Actually, Ashley McEvoy and her team are doing a great job in terms of ensuring that across all four platforms so, eye, health, cardiovascular, interventional and orthopedics, that we've got solid plans for execution and improved performance going forward, coupled with stronger innovation. So I would say, I don't have a full estimate as to what other competitors' challenges may have added to ours. We've got a ballpark estimate, but I would say, it was probably offset by the supply disruptions that we referenced earlier. So you get back to that normalized level of, let's call it, 3% to 4%.","Danielle Antalffy ","And then just a higher level comment on the other income upside that you're going to be reinvesting, to follow up on an earlier question. When you do need to scale back spend, given potentially lower other income as we look into 2020 and beyond, what are the levers that you can pull to do that and in which businesses is it easiest to sort of scale back without giving up anything on the top-line?","Joe Wolk ","So, we're currently looking to improve the operating margin profile within our Consumer unit. A great job by Thibaut Mongon, Joaquin in terms of really centering and focusing our investment, prioritizing that toward our stronghold of beauty, skin care, as well as over-the-counter medicines. And we are projected to have a strong improvement in that margin profile for this year and then, going forward. I would say the same with Medical Devices. Once you have an improving top line, that should help the rest of the P&L. And Ashley is going about her business that way and making the right structural changes.","And then, lastly, in Pharmaceuticals, we're already at the top of the peer set with respect to operating margin performance, but as that top-line improves and we anniversary some of the challenges that I mentioned earlier, that should also bode well for some, I would say, incremental improvement.","Chris DelOrefice ","Great. Thanks Danielle. Appreciate the questions. Next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matt Miksic ","Thanks for taking the questions. Just one follow up on pharma, and then, a bigger picture question on Medical Devices. So, you talked a little bit about the XARELTO launch for CAD and PAD maybe taking some time. If you could elaborate maybe on what some of the challenges there, or steps that have to take place to start gaining momentum on that front? And then, I just have one follow up.","Joaquin Duato ","Thank you for the question Matt. Certainly, the difference with the launches that we had in other indications like AFib and VTE is that the use of novel oral anticoagulants in CAD\/PAD is novel. So we are establishing a new standard of care there. So far it was either aspirin the one medicine used. So, establishing a new standard of care takes longer than when you are comparing to an existing standard of care. So we think that the progression will continue to be like a chronic medication, steady but constantly growing. And as I said, we are exceeding the launch align metrics of BRILINTA and we are similar to ENTRESTO. At this point, just to give you an idea of the extension of the use of XARELTO in CAD\/PAD, we have 8,500 prescribers already. So we see a steady climb and we are confident that it would become very important driver of growth for XARELTO.","Matt Miksic ","That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just on Medical Devices broadly, I think, one of the questions we get often is just the steps that J&J can take to turn the growth up in this division. Of course, you have bright spots like Biosense Webster and Cerenovus and others in the quarter, which you've talked about. But I wonder if I can ask just what -- robotic surgery is obviously an area where you've invested, continue to invest, but Joe maybe if you could sketch out the areas of Med Devices where you feel like there are disruptive opportunities or areas where J&J can enter, expand, invest and make an impact on this division?","Joe Wolk ","Sure, Matt. So, again, we are seeing improved growth rates from what we were experiencing 12 to 24 months ago. We're continuing on that right cadence I believe. If I look at opportunities as to where we're playing, you mentioned digital surgery, that will be a growth driver going forward. I think in our interventional space, specifically around our Cerenovus unit and stroke, it's a small unit that we don't report out on, but we grew about 25% in the quarter. We think that has tremendous opportunity. We do know that eye health and contact lenses specifically will be a growth driver for us based on the cadence of innovation we've got coming through there.","And we'll have improved performance with orthopedics. We obviously had some challenges last year with respect to knee performance. As we launch with Orthotaxy at some point late next year or early in '21, as well as bring cementless options to the marketplace, I think we'll be in very good shape, where you'll see this unit performing at or above market.","Matt Miksic ","And any things on areas outside the Company that you think about in terms of investing, not just in your businesses but externally like Auris?","Joe Wolk ","Yes. We're always looking, Matt, across all three of our segments to fortify the portfolio that we have today. There's one or two areas that we're not currently in, but we're going to make sure that: one, we can create value and that asset is in our hands and that we're compensating shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. So we don't just simply look at the cost of capital. There would be some risk opportunity associated with that opportunity that we will make sure that we compensate for. So, I guess that's a long way of saying, we're going to make sure that we pay the right value. We're not in a position were we need to do something. We'll do something when it makes sense to do it from a strategic as well as a financial perspective.","Chris DelOrefice ","Thanks Matt. Appreciate the questions. Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins ","I'll be quick. Just two and I'll mention them both upfront. First, on the Pharma side, at the beginning of the year, you guys gave guidance on the headwind from generics and biosimilars of roughly $3 billion to $3.5 billion. Can you just give an update on where you stand with that number today? And then, secondly, just a quick clarification on the talc litigation. Are you guys reserving for that currently or no? Thank you.","Joe Wolk ","So, let me take the talk question quickly. So, we did incur a charge in our earnings for the quarter of $190 million. That is related to defense costs only. That does not contemplate settlement or any liability payments. So again, we think we are on very firm ground with respect to the facts, supporting our case and as I've mentioned on appeal, when we don't win in the original verdicts we prevail on appeal. So that's the only charge that you'll see in there for the quarter, Bob.","Joaquin Duato ","Thank you, Bob. As I said before, our growth this year is mainly driven by the strength of our core franchises. We have nine medicines growing double digit. And we see all across our franchises very strong growth. We commented DARZALEX with 57%, but also IMBRUVICA 39%, STELARA 18%, TREMFYA doing very well. So overall very positive growth in our core franchises.","At the same time, we have seen less genetic erosion than anticipated mainly due to two factors. One, it's related to lower generic erosion in ZYTIGA that we anticipated and we think that's going to increase as the year goes on, and also a delay in the introduction of TRACLEER genetic. So we see now our headwind from LOE perspective between $2.5 billion to $3 billion.","Chris DelOrefice ","Great. Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our Company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks.","Joe Wolk ","Thanks, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the call for your interest as well as your time. As you can see in today's results, not just for the quarter but for the first half, we are well set up for both near and long term success. We continue to manage our portfolio to benefit patients, healthcare systems and shareholders and we will continue to invest for impact.","As we anniversary some of the LOE challenges in Pharmaceuticals and continue our upward momentum in our Consumer Health and Medical Device segments, we feel the business is poised for even greater success going forward. So, again, thanks for your time and enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2015.","Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer and Gary Pruden, Worldwide Chairman Medical Devices.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I will begin by briefly reviewing the third quarter for the corporation and our three business segments.","Next Gary will discuss our Medical Device business and the strategy for growth. Lastly, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the results, review the income statement and discuss guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.","Now, I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.1 billion for the third quarter of 2015, down 7.4% versus third quarter 2014. On an operational basis, sales were up 0.8% and currency had a negative impact of 8.2%. In the U.S., sales were down 0.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 2.1%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 15.8%.","On an operational basis, both Europe and Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., grew 2.7%, while the Asia Pacific Africa region grew by 1.2%. Growth in all regions was negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and hepatitis C sales underlying operational growth was 5.6% worldwide, 7.7% in the U.S., and 3.8% outside the U.S.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $3.4 billion and earnings per share were $1.20 versus $1.66 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $437 million and a charge of $377 million for after-tax special items. 2014 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net gain of $144 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.","Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.49, representing decreases of 9.4% and 7.5% respectively as compared to the same period in 2014.","Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1.2%.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. I will begin with the consumer segment.","Worldwide consumer segment sales of $3.3 billion increased 3.1%, with the U.S. sales up 8.9%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 0.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 4% worldwide, 8.9% in the U.S., and 1.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by U.S. OTC and Skin Care, Women's Health outside the U.S. and Oral Care worldwide.","OTC sales results were driven by strong U.S. growth of 22.4% with analgesics in the U.S. up nearly 29% due to increased share complemented by the reintroduction of Tylenol Arthritis including initial launch inventory.","In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12.5%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was 44.5%, up from 41% a year ago. Additional contributors to growth in the U.S. were seasonal inventory build for ZYRTEC and in the initial stocking for re-launched digestive health products.","Results outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by the timing of the seasonal inventory build for upper respiratory products. As we noted last quarter, the build occurred in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year.","In U.S. Skin Care market share increases and a seasonal inventory build drove strong growth for AVEENO and NEUTROGENA. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women's Health products outside the U.S.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.7 billion decreased 0.3% with U.S. sales down 4.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.5%. New competitors in Hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results.","Excluding sales of Hepatitis C products OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 10.1%, 11.5% and 8.5% respectively.","Important contributors to growth were INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, SIMPONI, STELARA, INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION, PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX, CONCERTA, XARELTO, and ZYTIGA partially offset by lower export sales of REMICADE.","Strong momentum in market share increases drove results for INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET. In the U.S., INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET achieved 6.3% total prescription share or TRx within the defined market of type-2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015.","TRx with endocrinologists was over 13% for the quarter and over 5.5% in primary care. INVOKANA has greater than 80% preferred access across commercial and greater than 90% for Part D plans.","Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second line CLL and MCL. Outside the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake, particularly in Germany, France, and the U.K.","IMBRUVICA is now approved in 60 countries. STERALA and combine SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth across all the major regions due to robust market growth combined with increased penetration of SIMPONI ARIA.","INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results due primarily to increased market share where CONCERTA growth was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generics by the FDA last November.","As expected during the quarter we saw generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S. We have launched an authorized generic of INVEGA.","Strong results for PREZISTA were driven by the launch earlier this year of PREZCOBIX. Continued share growth drove results for XARELTO sales with TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market of 15.8% up 1.5 points from a year ago. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay.","As an update, during the quarter we received several Paragraph IV notifications from generic manufacturers advising that they filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of XARELTO in the U.S. before the expiration of the relevant patents listed in the orange book.","The composition of matter patent owned by our partner Bayer is expected to expire in December 2020. However a patent term extension has been filed, which if fully granted with extend the patent to mid-2024.","Further if we are granted pediatric exclusivity, this will provide an additional six months to the existing marketing exclusivity or patent term. We together with Bayer will vigorously defend the patents and have filed suit against the generic applicants.","Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer market at over 12.5% drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was 27.1% of that market down approximately one point on a sequential basis due to increased competition.","Outside the U.S., ZYTIGA achieved strong growth in Asia and Latin America, which was partially offset by lower sales in Europe due to increased competition. REMICADE export sales were down over 40% with two-thirds of that decline attributed to sales to our partners in Japan due to an inventory draw down in preparation for our label expansion for a new indication.","Additionally, the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe has negatively impacted results.","I will now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.9%. U.S. sales increased 2% while sales outside the U.S. increased 0.1%.","Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 1.3% worldwide with the U.S. up 2% and growth of 0.8% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by Vision Care, Specialty Surgery, and Cardiovascular Care partially offset by lower sales in Orthopaedics and price declines in the diabetes care.","Vision Care results was strong across the major regions driven by the introduction of new products. Market growth, share gains in certain segments and new product introduction drove the results for specialty surgery growth with worldwide bio-surgery growth of over 9%, energy growth outside the U.S. of approximately 6% and worldwide Mentor growth of nearly 13%. Cardiovascular care growth was driven by 9% worldwide increase in our electrophysiology business due to strong sales of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter.","Solid growth in the U.S. for orthopaedics was offset by lower sales outside the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by softer demand and a reduction in inventory levels primarily in China.","The introduction earlier this year of the TFNA nail drove U.S. trauma growth of approximately 5%. Additional contributors to the U.S. growth were strong double-digit sales of ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC, 3% growth in hips due to our primary stem platform and 2% growth in knees due to the success of the ATTUNE platform. In the U.S. positive mix from new product introductions partially offset negative price in the major categories.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2015. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary Pruden. Gary?","Gary Pruden ","Thanks, Louise. I'm pleased to be here today to share with you the terrific work that's taking place at our Johnson & Johnson Medical Device Group and why we\u2019re excited for the future.","As you recall, Sandi Peterson provided an update on our consumer facing Medical Devices in the second quarter, so my discussion today is focused on our surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular businesses. I will provide our perspective on the market which we\u2019re operating, our unique advantages, our performance through the third quarter and most important our strategy to win.","Before we begin, I thought it will be helpful to provide some framing around the business and the quarter performance overall. Our medical device business excluding the consumer facing medical device business and OCD has grown 1.8% on a year-to-date operational basis.","When we adjust for the women's health and Cordis business, in addition to several non-recurring impacts on our business, the underlying year-to-date operational growth was 2.8%. Our stated goal is to lead in the categories in which we compete. Today across our portfolio we have strong platforms such as Endocutters and Biosurgery that are outperforming market growth.","We have substantial platforms which we see growing solely such as wound closure, where we have roughly an 80% share and we've identified areas that require further attention and infusion of innovation.","We believe we have sound strategies to achieve our leadership goals. Our driving growth through enhanced innovation and excellence in execution, design to get us two or above market growth in the next 12 to 24 months.","In Medical Devices we\u2019ve been on the leading edge of industry consolidation. And our conviction has grown even stronger that our breadth, depth and scale can be leveraged to make it difference to those reserve.","Throughout my remarks this morning, I will share examples of how the medical device businesses of Johnson & Johnson are stronger together and how together we will accelerate growth and innovation. We're competing in attractive global market growing at roughly 4% where we hold leadership positions in surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular electrophysiology.","Demographics favored continued market growth as population's age, the incidence of chronic diseases grow and more people gain access to care globally. As both customers and providers seek to improve efficiency, effectiveness and manage escalating cost, consolidation has accelerated both within our global customer base and the industry.","As one Medical Device Group, we enjoy unique market advantages today starting with the broad portfolio of medical offerings, surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular. And we have the financial and industry strength of Johnson & Johnson behind us that enables us to invest in growth platforms and bring comprehensive solutions to bear on global healthcare issues.","In emerging markets, we have a substantial presence which delivered roughly 20% of our revenue through the third quarter of this year. Our annualized sales in China alone continue to expand and currently exceed $1 billion year-to- date.","We have a strong leadership position in categories such as trauma, minimally invasive surgery and sutures that help us facilitate a tip-of-the- sword strategy to establish leadership scale in emerging markets where we can then expand our key growth platforms.","And finally, we compete from a position of strength. The number one or two market positions in virtually every category in which we do business. As one Johnson & Johnson Medical Device Group aligned to a common strategy, we will accelerate the benefits of these advantages going forward","Our sales year-to-date were driven by the strong performances our electrophysiology, endocutter, bio-surgery and international energy businesses, complemented by our solid results in joint reconstruction and sports medicine business.","Partially offsetting this growth were lower sales of spine and women's health problems. Our 2015 results continue to be impacted by the relatively soft global market conditions. We are seeing the market in the U.S. improve but EMEA growth remains challenged and the emerging markets have slowed this year.","We expect the soft market conditions and pricing challenges across the Board to continue. While we have strong category leaders across surgery, cardiovascular and Orthopaedics, we also have some opportunities to address platform challenges and reallocate resources to high growth opportunities in some of our platforms like trauma.","In trauma we have seen mixed results in our performance. This has been an important area of focus since acquisition. However we have seen a lower level of innovation though due to a number of factors including the significant remediation effort to bring some of these up to Johnson & Johnson quality standards and the overall integration efforts during the last few years.","Going forward, we are shifting more of our focus and resources to deliver new innovative products and target faster growing categories within the market such as elective foot and ankle. The recent success of our new Femoral Nail System TFN advanced demonstrates receptivity in this category to new and meaningful innovation.","We also continue to strengthen the trauma franchise capabilities and high growth market such as U.S. and China. Additionally in trauma as across the entire portfolio, we recognize the value of strategic partnerships and helping us to achieve our aspirations.","Through a new five year cooperation agreement between DePuy Synthes and the AO Foundation, we will continue to develop innovative products and solutions, train more surgeons to improve standards of care and treat more patients globally.","With respect to the broader portfolio management, earlier this month we completed the divestiture of the Cordis business. Through portfolio of discipline we will continue to exit categories that do not fit our strategy and evaluate our portfolio to identify those growth categories or heavier R&D investment, external partnerships and L&A.","In summary, we are sharpening our focus and investment on priority platforms that we believe will drive the majority of our growth. As I noted earlier, roughly 20% of our growth came from emerging markets and more than 50% of our revenue year-to-date has come from outside the U.S.","In line with what you\u2019re hearing broadly about the economic slowdown of emerging markets, we see that too. But we are maintaining nice growth across our business in these markets. Consistent with that, over the next five years we continue to expect emerging markets to drive this proportional growth opportunities as access to quality health care continues to expand.","The World Health Organization estimates that nearly a third of the world's global disease burden could be addressed through surgery. Yet nearly 5 billion people continue to lack access to safe, timely and affordable surgical care.","Our goal is to reach more patients and restore more lives. We aim to achieve this through meaningful innovation and efforts to expand access to care including continued physician training.","We are confident that the results will be improved standards of care for patients around the world and sales growth above industry rates or maintaining industry leading competitive margins.","We have a clear strategy to achieve this - accelerate growth in priority platforms through innovation and launch excellence, sustain growth in our core platforms, leverage our breadth and scale through novel commercial models and invest in areas of significant unmet needs. This is a strategy we believe will deliver more value for customers and patients and for our company and shareholders.","Our strategy starts with our three industry categories of surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular. Across the portfolio, we have identified six priority growth platforms in which we disproportionately invest to accelerate growth. These are the areas where the medical need continues to be significant and our capabilities are strong.","In surgery, our priority platforms are endocutters and energy. Not only are we getting good response from our customers on these platforms which you are seeing in the numbers, but we're winning top awards for the design of innovative solutions that benefit the user, the environment and the business.","You can see that we flag robotics as one of our key growth platforms here in surgery and I'll provide a little more on that later.","In orthopaedics we are prioritizing our knees and trauma platforms. Knee replacement is the single largest selective procedure in orthopaedics. Over the next six years, worldwide knee market is expected to grow at 3.8% CAGR to around $9 billion.","We believe we're well placed for growth with products and instruments from our ATTUNE platform and in cardiovascular, electrophysiology continue to deliver strong growth and is a priority platform for us through our Biosense Webster business.","Additionally across these broad categories, we're targeting four core platforms in which we'll sustain growth and continue to divest in innovation. You can see here that in surgery the foundation platforms in the space are bio-surgery and wound closure.","In orthopaedics, our hip business is a key platform and finally sterilization and disinfection, a core capability that addresses the still significant unmet need for preventing infection, which drives successive cost and extends healing time for patients.","Let me be clear, this focused strategy is not to say that we will not invest in other platforms where we compete. There remain important areas for our future. We expect the combination of our priority and sustained growth platforms to deliver a significant portion of our growth over the next five years.","These platforms will be a major contributor to our ability to grow above market in the coming years. We're focusing on the nine key geographies where we believe we can drive the majority of our growth. These markets are being targeted based on strong healthcare utilization outlook, large unmet need within medical devices and a strong Johnson & Johnson presence footprint within these markets.","Last year at our Medical Device Investor Business Review, we discussed 30 significant filings that were planned by the end of 2016. We're well on the way to achieving that goal, which provides a consistent means of product introductions all contributing to growth.","Those new product innovations combined with our aggressive reallocation of resources I just discussed complemented by our novel commercial models, positions us well to grow faster than the market.","We've identified five disease states, five areas of unmet needs where we think we can make the greatest difference through innovation, internally or externally sourced. They include surgical oncology, obesity, select cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.","We're exploring what will take a combination of products and end to end solutions to make the critical difference for physicians and patients addressing these needs and we'll take advantage of our strong balance sheet to invest in innovation that can make a difference in these areas as well as our priority technology platforms.","We're taking a comprehensive approach to innovation and we're looking at this across a number of fronts including our go-to-market strategy. We're building novel commercial models that are adapting to market conditions and developing new strategic partnerships with our customers around the world. I'll expand on that area shortly.","Our strategies are enhanced by the opportunity to leverage our scale and breadth. That begins with the core selling opportunities like the inclusion of DERMABOND PRINEO, our newest wound closure device designed for joint procedure, now in the bag of our joint reconstruction sales consultants.","Needing time to closure in knee and hip replacement procedures, we're also implementing cross portfolio procedural development like the new OsteoView device, which leverages the harmonic technology from Ethicon to provide a soft tissue dissector, exclusively designed for spine procedures and to be sold by the DePuy Spine business.","It extends further to our enterprise customer group, which works on key relationships with major hospital systems, who look to leverage unique Johnson & Johnson capabilities and our medical device agreements.","Some great examples are a new relationship established with one of Germany's largest private hospital networks where we have a sole source contract for implants. Here in the U.S., we signed a five-year contract with the globally ranked academic medical center at Johns Hopkins. We're also executing an exclusive partnership with a large multinational hospital system to share risk and great value.","These are just some of the most recent examples on how our clinical strength and organizational flexibility and scope provide an excellent roadmap for how we're engaging in a new way with customers today.","Johnson & Johnson's substantial global footprint provides a foothold in key emerging markets and enables us to expand access to training to more surgeons and care for more patients. We are using that advantage to drive innovations that address unmet medical needs.","Working with our partners in the pharmaceutical business, we recently announced that China lung center project which will work to bring our medicines, technologies and resources to bear, to address one of that country's leading cause of death and ultimately advance the scientific knowledge and practice of lung surgery around the world.","Earlier this year we first shared with you the news about our collaboration with Google Life Sciences and surgical robotics. We continue to make progress on our goal of bringing to market a transformative surgical robotics platform.","Our shared vision is to give surgeons advanced analytics and surgical access properly with an improved and flexible work flow dynamics in the OR and ultimately a reduced cost to serve.","Through our Ethicon franchise we are contributing surgical know-how and developing advanced tools and instruments for superior, minimally invasive surgical technology. I'm pleased to share that we are in the development phase of the platform now and are working with respected global experts in the field of robotics to advance the effort. Additional information regarding our progress will be communicated in just the next few weeks.","The global robotics market is roughly $2 billion and we expect procedures to grow at a double-digit growth rate. That said, today's robotics options are limited and requiring substantial financial and infrastructure investment and we believe that through technology advancements and agile application, our path in surgically assisted robotics is one that will best deliver what surgeons need.","Our solution not only aims to give surgeons a better procedural experience by improving comfort and patient proximity, but delivers a superior surgical experience through greater access and precision with the ability to make more informed decisions through the entire procedure.","We can see a future in which the surgeon is no longer isolated in the OR, but through our system we'll be able to connect to critical data, imaging and diagnostic information. Information that will help a surgeon make the best, most accurate decisions as and when they are needed.","The system is being developed with both the healthcare provider and the economic buyer in mind. As one Johnson & Johnson medical device group, we are well positioned in our largest businesses to build on leadership position as these categories grow in response to changing demographics, evolving unmet medical needs, and expanding access to care.","Across our portfolio, we are focused on the categories where we will grow and lead. We have exciting pipelines and a renewed focus on launch excellence that will deliver steady cadence of meaningful and differentiated innovation.","At the same time, we seek to advocate for patients by advancing the standard of care through strategic partnerships and educational access and pushing the boundaries of medical device product innovation.","We are deploying the comprehensive resources of Johnson & Johnson across the group which gives us unique leverage. And we're getting a positive response from customers. It is these strategic customer wins, combined with our more than 30 significant product launches that positions us to grow faster than our market and deliver value for the company and our shareholders.","We look forward to telling you more about how our strategy is gaining traction at the medical device business review next May.","Now, I'll turn it back to Dominic.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks, Gary and good morning everyone. Let me just say that I really enjoy working alongside Gary in the management committee. He has clear strategies for accelerating growth through innovation and leveraging the breadth and scale of medical devices through novel commercial models. We are confident that we will see steady progress as the business under Gary's leadership implements very sound strategies for growth.","Just this morning we announced a $10 billion share repurchase program. We are very well positioned to drive continued growth in shareholder value with our exceptional financial strength including our strong balance sheet and cash flow.","We have a proven track record of returning capital to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend complemented by share repurchases. At the same time, we continue to invest in internal growth drivers and strengthen our robust pipeline and we continue to be active in accessing external opportunities to deploy our financial strength to further drive long-term value creating growth.","We anticipate commencing the share repurchase program in the near term and intend to finance it through the issuance of debt. Repurchase of stock through the program will be made at our discretion from time-to-time and the repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.","Moving on to a review of the quarter, since Gary has just covered our medical device business, I would like to highlight several additional developments from this quarter in our pharmaceutical, consumer and the consumer medical device businesses.","Our pharmaceutical business continues to deliver strong underlying growth and as we discussed at our pharmaceutical Analyst Day earlier this year, our future cadence of new product filings is very robust.","This quarter we filed for marketing authorization in Europe for daratumumab, a treatment for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma which received accelerated assessment from the CHMP.","Daratumumab was also granted priority review in the US. We are also \u2013 we've also submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application to the US FDA for IMBRUVICA, for treatment of naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marketing authorization in Europe for once every three month formulation of paliperidone palmitate.","In our consumer business, we are back to a consistent cadence of new products as we continue to reintroduce products back through shelves, as well as innovate across our beloved brands that you all know and use every day.","In particular, the re-launch of TYLENOL Arthritis is doing very well. In our vision care business, we have anniversary pricing adjustments that have impacted growth rates and have also introduced new products such as 1-Day ACUVUE MOIST Multifocal, 1-Day ACUVUE DEFINE, LACREON and ACUVUE OASYS or one week overnight, and in the fourth quarter, we are launching ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day HydraLuxe, an important advancement in comfort for contact lens wearers.","I'll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the third quarter and we'll also then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of the year.","We continue to execute well on our portfolio management strategy, consistent with the plans we laid out for the year and we're pleased with the solid underlying sales results and continued solid earnings per share performance thus far in 2015. We are well positioned for continued growth in today's dynamic healthcare environment.","Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2015. As we expected, direct comparisons to our third quarter of 2014 are challenging, due to the exceptional uptake of OLYSIO that we benefited from last year, as well as currency heads winds.","Our sales results for the third quarter of 2015 on an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and excluding the impact of Hep C products were robust, up 5.6% for the quarter. This is in line with the annual guidance we set for 2015 and stronger than 2014 on a comparable basis.","Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings, adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense.","Adjusted net earnings were $4.2 billion in the quarter, which are down 9.4% compared to the third quarter of 2014 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 versus $1.61 a year ago are down 7.5%, having been significantly impacted by currency movements as you may have expected.","I am pleased to say that the adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by FirstCall. Excluding the net impact of translation currency, our operational earnings per share was $1.63 or up 1.2%.","In the quarter we incurred after tax special charges of $377 million which included litigation expenses associated with previously disclosed matters as outlined in our 10-Q filing, as well as intangible amortization expense of some $437 million on an after tax basis, which in this quarter also included the write-down of an intangible asset related to a small acquisition we made several years ago.","Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. This quarter's results reflect both the gain from our divestiture of the SPLENDA brand to Heartland Food Products Group which we closed at the end of the third quarter, and additional investments we made in the business.","As we said before, we would use any gains from divestitures in 2015 to offset the lower earnings impact of not having the OLYSIO sales uptake we had in 2014 to provide some offset to currency headwinds, while also allowing continued investments for future growth.","Cost of goods sold was 130 basis points higher than the same period last year impacted by both lower net sale prices as well as changes in product mix.","Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were [20.7%] [ph] of sales. As a reminder, this line in the prior year period included the additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, which we treated as a special item last year. Adjusting for that, this line item was 28.4% of sales last year.","So this year\u2019s amount is 130 basis points higher as compared to the adjusted third quarter of 2014. As we have previously noted we're continuing to invest the drive growth in our key brands. Prior year percent of sales was artificially low as well since very little spending occurred in relation to OLYSIO sales.","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.6% in the quarter and 160 basis points higher than the prior year, as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth.","Interest expense, net of interest income was a little lower reflecting higher earnings on our investment. Other income and expense was a net charge of $420 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $1.3 billion in the same period last year.","Of course, this line item includes several special items of both years. Excluding those special items other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $400 million compared to a net gain of approximately $40 million in the prior year period. This year's third quarter reflects the gain on the previously announced divestiture of SPLENDA.","Excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, the effective tax rate for the nine months period was 21.6% compared to 22.1% in the same nine-month period last year. As I noted during our call in July, the effective tax rate for this quarter and for the nine-months this year does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit, as that legislation has not yet been passed although we expect that it will be.","The effective tax rate is lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the mix of foreign earnings to lower tax jurisdictions this year as compared to last year.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast, beginning with cash, and interest income and expense.","At the end of the quarter we had approximately $17 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $37 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $20 billion of debt.","This is a higher level of cash than we typically hold and we are actively looking for the right opportunities to use that capital to create greater value for our shareholders.","As we have discussed before, we have a well known and disciplined capital allocation strategy that starts with paying dividends, followed by value creating M&A and then we consider other ways to return value to shareholders such as through a share repurchase program.","To that end, as you know this morning we announced a $10 billion share repurchase program and we believe the Company shares on attractive investment opportunity and repurchasing our shares is an important part of our capital allocation strategy.","Although we are continuing to evaluate external growth opportunities in line with this strategy, for purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash other than the share repurchase program we just announced. We suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $500 million just a slight tightening of the range from prior guidance.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs.","We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding any special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. This is slightly higher than our previous guidance.","As a reminder, this now includes the gain sort of divestiture of the U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine earlier this year, the SPLENDA brand this quarter, and the Cordis business, which we closed just after the quarter and will be recorded in the fourth quarter.","As I mentioned in previous quarters, a portion of other income and expense will flow through to increase operational earnings as we expect to use some of these gains in other income to compensate for the decreased income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014, as well as to help us mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds this year for we also will continue to invest in our core business and opportunities for future growth.","And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress although that has not yet occurred. We will therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015 excluding special items of approximately 21% to 22% and this is consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it would negatively impact the tax rate by approximately half percentage point.","Turning to guidance on sales and earnings. As we\u2019ve done for several years our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.","We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current foreign exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. This is consistent with our previous guidance and now reflects the impact of the divestiture of the Cordis business offset by stronger performance in other businesses.","Additionally by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2014, our operational sales growth for 2015 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, as well as the impact of hepatitis C products, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014.","As of last week, the Euro was lower by approximately 16% as compared to 2014 average levels and the dollar strengthened versus virtually all major currencies. Although we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of this year, our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 7%, reflecting the weakening of the Euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar.","Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range between negative 5% and negative 6%, for total expected level of reported sales of between approximately $70 billion and $71 billion.","And now turning to earnings, a significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions which although hedged, is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 50 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014.","We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $6.75 to $6.80 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of between roughly 5.5% and 6.5%.","The midpoint is higher than our previous guidance as we\u2019ve increased the lower end of the range reflecting some operational improvements in the business and our confidence at this point in the year.","Again we're not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share, if currency exchange rates for all 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.60 per share which is consistent with the estimate we provided in our previous guidance.","Therefore our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.15 to $6.20 per share. At this stage in the year, we are comfortable raising the lower end and tightening the range.","So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, I would like to make a few key points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2%, we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and Hep C product competition, our operational sales growth at the midpoint of our guidance is a solid 6% for the full year of 2015 as compared to 5% for 2014.","And with regard to earnings, on a constant currency basis our guidance on operational EPS growth is strong in the range between 5.5% and 6.5%, which was higher than our previous guidance.","And as we execute on our growth platforms, we're continuing to make investments in our business and we're prioritizing our portfolios. We remain focused on building our priority pipelines across the enterprise to position our company future growth and expanded leadership in markets around the world.","Also I would like to thank the employees of Johnson & Johnson for what they do every day to make a difference to patients and consumers and for their continued significant contributions to growing our business.","And now I would like to turn things back to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. Manny, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] With that, your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start with the buyback. Maybe Dominic, you could talk about the timing. In the past you've done these pretty quickly. And it doesn't sound like, based on your comments, that it's a signal that the M&A targets out there aren't as attractive as you may have thought. Is that fair? Just from an EPS standpoint, by our math it's about $0.20. Then I had one follow-up.","Dominic Caruso","Sure Larry, let me try to address each of those questions. So as far as the timeframe, it's an open-ended share repurchase program as we said. So there is no real particular timeframe, but just by way of reference the most recent share repurchase program that we implemented which was $5 billion in 2014 took about nine months to complete.","So we continuously try to buy our stock at the appropriate prices throughout any trading period and just as a reminder, we're also simultaneously continuing to buy any stock that's issued in connection with our employee stock programs and that's about another $3 billion of cash utilized for that purpose.","With respect to any read through on M&A activity this in no way has any negative impact on our outlook for M&A and our pursuit of value creating acquisitions to drive shareholder value. So we have the financial strength and flexibility to do both and we're very pleased to be able to continue to do that.","As far as the EPS impact, again as you know this is always a tricky calculation because on a weighted average share calculation, but if it was fully implemented then a full year impact of a fully implemented $10 billion share buyback would be about two to three percentage points of incremental EPS growth.","Now of course we won't see very much of that in '15 because we're just beginning and we'll see some of that show up in the 2016 earnings. We'll give you a better sense of that in January, but certainly by 2017 when it's fully implemented, we would see that total percentage positive impact that I just mentioned.","Larry Biegelsen","That's very helpful. And then I feel compelled to ask one about the rhetoric coming out of Washington, Dominic, on pharmaceutical pricing and price controls, which has gotten a lot of media attention recently. Where do you see that ultimately going? What's J&J's perspective? And, just lastly, in the early 1990s I think a lot of pharmaceutical companies, when Hillary Clinton was trying to reform healthcare, pledged not to raise drug prices by more than inflation. Is that something that J&J would reconsider? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Larry. Let's see, well you're right. There has been a lot of rhetoric about pharmaceutical drug pricing and despite significant media attention on drug pricing, there really isn\u2019t a consensus on policy solutions that would lower prices without negatively impacting innovation, that's the key point.","I think every time we talk about drug pricing, we unfortunately miss the balance of the other side of the coin which is of course the innovation that comes from the pharmaceutical industry and the improvement in the health and well being lives of many people around the world.","The pharmaceutical industry has and continues to be a constructive partner in any of these policy debates and we look for solutions to the issue along with policy makers.","Just as a reminder, as part of the Affordable Care Act industry agreed to increased rebates in Medicaid and many other additional fees that I know you're all very familiar with and as the U.S. healthcare system evolves, I think we'll have more of a focus on outcomes and value and we're working with both public and private payors to develop innovative outcome based contracts.","We think the real answer to this dilemma is to monitor and provide outcome based metrics and not simply focus only on price.","As far as a pledge Larry, I think we're very responsible in our drug pricing and we tend to support the price for our drugs with strong economic data. So rather than pledge to a particular number, I think it's important that we continue to develop robust data that provides a solid foundation for the value that our products provide to healthcare systems. So we'll continue to do that.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you for taking the questions.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, I thought I would turn the question back to devices here for a second. Two areas I wanted to focus in on. The first is on your innovation sectors, Gary, you talked about four or five of those areas are within or adjunctive to your dominant franchises in ortho and surgical.","Then you have this commentary on select cardio areas. So, my question is, Gary, first, why even focus on cardio, an area where you have less dominant breadth? Is it just because there's innovation there and you're going to be selective? Then I had a quick follow-up.","Gary Pruden","Thank you, David, and good morning. Yes, it's a great question. Listen we have I think been pretty consistent and when I had this conversation before that we see in cardiovascular there are interesting areas where there is a lot of growth opportunities and also unmet needs.","I think we've talked about them before and said areas like CHF heart failure, structural heart are fast growing categories where there is a lot of unmet need and where we think we can add to our breadth that we have with the EP business currently.","So as always we will be opportunistic in looking at opportunities both internally and externally to add to our portfolio. We think cardiovascular is a large category. Agreed we don't have the same scale as we do in surgery and orthopaedics, but we will look for opportunities to add to that scale with the appropriate types of investments that will create shareholder value in spaces where we think there is a lot of growth and opportunity.","So we continue to look at that space. We've highlighted as we've done today remains an area where we've made some investments right because we do investments in small companies and technologies through our Johnson & Johnson Development Corp and we'll continue to evaluate the M&A field as well.","David Lewis","Okay. And then, Gary, the other interesting commentary this morning obviously was on robotics. I know it's very early days here but I wonder if you could just give us some high-level strategic thoughts. And two areas of focus.","One would be, should we expect very significant capital systems to be sold from J&J through this partnership or should we see more less expensive capital systems than perhaps are out there today? And a related question is how do you think about cost effectiveness? How do you think about the cost effectiveness of any disposables that you sell versus robotics relative to existing robotic disposables? Thank you very much.","Gary Pruden","Thank you, David, and listen really good questions. Let me take the last one first. I think you saw in my presentation, cost to serve we see as an opportunity right. If you look at the robotics installed base as it is today, it's very much focused on the developed markets versus the emerging markets and that's because cost to serve is disproportionately out of balance.","And we think that there are opportunities to have a much smaller footprint in terms of a technology, a lower cost to serve in terms of disposables as well as capital that we think can play across a broader range of surgical procedures in a cost effective way that improves the capability of the surgeon, provides real time data and analytics at their fingertips, greater OR flexibility and as mentioned there has an overall cost effectiveness which allows it to penetrate more procedures than what you see today.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking the call. I was just wondering if, Dominic, you could go into a little bit further detail on some of the businesses that are contributing to basically give you confidence to increase the underlying guidance for sales.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Kristen. Well, the pharmaceutical business continues to do very well. The growth as you saw in the quarter, we exclude the impacts of OLYSIO was over 10%. So it's very solid growth.","The consumer business is launching new products and getting those products back on the shelf and the cadence of new product introductions, as well as the uptake gives us encouragement that we're seeing very, very good results there. And some of Gary's businesses, although some are challenged as he pointed out, some continue to do very well, electrophysiology and others.","So I think we're confident that despite losing a quarter of the sales from the Cordis business, the rest of the businesses are performing well enough to pick up that difference and we're comfortable maintaining our sales guidance for the year.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Then how should we just think about looking ahead in terms of Cordis being out, is there enough momentum to offset any dilution there or does the stock repurchase help offset some of that as we look ahead? Not giving guidance for 2016, but should we think of the share repurchase similar to what you did for the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics?","Dominic Caruso","Well, there is two things going on here. I think one is of course the share repurchase will add incremental EPS growth that helps offset some dilution. But I think the real difference is we're not going to have the kind of headwind comparison that we had '15 versus '14 as we get into '16 and we feel that the momentum is strong going into '16.","So I wouldn't characterize the share repurchase as solely related to offset the delusion of Cordis. I think it will be incremental to our EPS growth.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. That\u2019s all I have.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning. Thank you, guys. Dominic, with most of the cash, almost all of the cash, outside the US, and the incremental $10 million of US debt for the share repurchase, are you assuming that you'll be able to use at least a portion of that O-US cash for any meaningful M&A in the near term?","Dominic Caruso","Mike, thanks for the question. We, as you know always look for tax efficient utilization of the OUS cash. As you know, we did that in the Synthes transaction a couple of years ago.","So we'll do our best to structure any M&A activity in a way that can optimize the effective use of the OUS cash in a tax efficient manner. So we continuously work on that and our team is very good at developing strategies to do that, and - but more to come on that at a later time.","Mike Weinstein","Understood. And is the $10 billion number the right number? Because it doesn't stress your ratings with the agencies.","Dominic Caruso","Mike, I don't think $10 billion is necessarily related to stressing any credit rating. I think it - as we've said many, many times, we have a disciplined capital allocation strategy and share repurchases just happen to be third in line after M&A and dividends being first.","So I think we're comfortable that doing $10 billion now, while we're still actively pursuing M&A activity is the right level to do now then we'll reassess that as that program begins to wind down. So I wouldn't necessarily think that this is a limit to what we can do at any time.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Then just one question for Gary, then I'll drop. Gary, one thing that stood out to me just this quarter, the pluses and minuses, on the minus side the O-US performance within the orthopaedic business, the spine business ex-currency was down 12%, trauma was down 6%. Can you shed any light on that?","Gary Pruden","Yeah, Mike. As mentioned, we had some one-time items that were occurring outside the US in our orthopaedics business. One, as Louise had mentioned in our, in China where we had a distributor inventory issue with some slowing of the markets there.","We had some - make some corrections to distributor inventories which predominantly hit the trauma business but all of them. And then also in Brazil we saw some registration issues happen as part of the integration and that also had an impact in slowing the business as well.","So those two predominant items had a disproportional impact in the quarter. We don't see those as ongoing issues. We are still excited about the opportunities for the business, specifically trauma in emerging markets we see as an opportunity and we will continue to focus our efforts there.","So yes, we were disappointed in that, but we do see them as one-time items and we are working through that as we speak. But we still see a lot of opportunity for the business outside the United States.","Mike Weinstein","Perfect. Thank you, Gary.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil Divan","Great. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So just a couple if I could on the pharma side. So one you mentioned on your diabetes with INVOKANA some of the market share information. I was just curious, obviously the positive data from Lilly on their SGLT2 inhibitor outcomes data.","Have you seen any initial impact or do you expect to see much of an impact within through the INVOKANA given that you guys are obviously the market leader there in that class.","And then just second, on the long-acting injectables, again you shared some insights. Just curious if you can share some thoughts with the new competition, a couple new players now in that space, how you think that might impact your growth looking forward? Thanks.","Gary Pruden","Let me take the question on INVOKANA first. We do think that the positive benefits seen by the Lilly compound is most likely a class effect for SGLT2. It's too early to comment on any effect that we've seen.","And we're also studying our compound regarding cardiovascular impacts. But that data is just a couple years away. But we do think there's a positive effect to the overall class as a result of the cardiovascular data that Lilly shared.","With respect to long-acting injectables, Louise, any comments on market dynamics there, have you see, I haven't seen much already.","Louise Mehrotra","We are still seeing strong growth in that market and we've also just introduced Trinza, which is the three month formulation. So we think we're in a very, very good competitive position there. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go you ahead.","Glenn Novarro","Good morning, guys. Gary, two questions for you. First, if I look at the device business in terms of what you've done over the last few years, you've been divesting assets, cardio assets, the diagnostics business.","As you go forward, as you look forward are there still businesses within your device portfolio that you think need to be divested because they are underperforming or do you see yourselves more as a net buyer of assets going forward? That's question one.","And then question two. Gary, you highlighted you're going to be launching 30 new device products over the next year or so. When I look at the portfolio of products that you'll be launching, a lot of these I see as kind of singles, maybe double?","And so I was wondering if you can look at that portfolio for us today, are there any products that actually could be bigger, what would be the products you think actually have the upside to get you back to market growth? Thanks.","Gary Pruden","Thanks, Glenn. Good questions. So first, in terms of divestitures, as you know and how Dominic talked about it, which is we have a companywide premise that we should be number one or number two in the categories where we're committed and have a clear technology path to getting through either a number one or number two position. And if we don't, we're going to consider our options.","So we have a very formalized process that we go through with the management committee and looking at our opportunities and we take on divestitures opportunities carefully as we've done in both the OCD and the Cordis situation.","We will continue to do that portfolio analysis on an ongoing basis. So I can't really say what's going to happen. But certainly we will continue to look at our portfolio in terms of opportunities.","We will also though continue to look at, Glenn, opportunities to acquire new businesses that we think are accretive, that will add to our business growth and create shareholder value.","So I think in a disciplined focused approach where we divest we will also look at opportunities to acquire. I think certainly accelerating our pace of tuck-in deals would be a good opportunity for medical device we seek, considering our scale in the market, especially in surgery and orthopaedics is large, and we anticipate accelerating that pace over the next 12 to 18 months.","In terms of the second question which was around opportunities as you look at our portfolio, you\u2019re right, we have a lot of \u2013 I\u2019ll call it \u2013 we call it singles and doubles, I would say we have a couple triples in there especially in the EP space that we think that will be some really game-changers.","The big one that I would highlight for you which would be very different than anything else will be robotics. Now the category as mentioned in my talk is $2 billion growing at double digit, we see disruptive opportunity happening in the next couple of years here for us to take a substantial share of the market going forward with a very different technology that\u2019s integrated and delivers value for our customers.","So, putting a lot of focus and efforts there which we think will be important and we are also looking at other opportunities for us from a L&A and M&A perspective to bring in exciting technology into our platform to accelerate growth as well.","So we have a couple of areas that I would say where I think we got some really interesting things. Also I would say in the next MD&D day coming up in May, you will see a little bit of the pipeline where in some of the areas that I am excited about but probably too early to disclose right now. And we will give you a little bit more detail at that point in time.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Thank you","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Danielle Antalffy","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just to touch on the M&A topic for a second, Gary, you did touch on it a little bit, mentioned tuck-in acquisitions. But if we take a step back, two questions for you guys here.","Number one, given the $10 billion share buyback announced today and the fact that that's priority number three, at least how you play it out, does that signal that your appetite for a large acquisition is maybe off the table and you will be focused more on the smaller, tuck-in type deals within pharma partnerships or in licensing deals?","And then, number two, if you look across your businesses, where are the holes that you'd like to fill as you look at the markets that are higher growth that you don't currently play in?","Dominic Caruso","Danielle, it\u2019s Dominic here, thanks for the question. I wouldn't interpret the $10 billion share buyback as impacting our appetite for scale of any size at M&A at all. Our appetite for M&A of any scale has entirely to do with whether or not the acquisition is going to create value for shareholders. And as you know we are disciplined about that.","It is true that over our history, we have done many-many acquisitions and the largest ones are a few and far between but that has to do with what Gary mentioned with business of our scale, we can bring in lots of tuck-ins or licenses for example in the pharma business where we can get the most value for our shareholders in the most capital efficient manner. But it doesn\u2019t preclude us from that also looking for large scale acquisitions.","As far as where we would look, in pharma we are focused on five therapeutic areas. I think we\u2019ll remain focused there. In consumer, as you know we have our core platforms of Skin Care, Oral Care, OTC in particular, as well as emerging market and for medical devices Gary, why don\u2019t I ask you to just comment on the areas of focus.","Gary Pruden","Absolutely. I think if you look at one of the slides in our strategy to win, our innovation focus areas, we are really focused on five key unmet needs. So one is in we see in surgical oncology, which the space is really evolving as we speak. Where we see more targeted interventions that using our combinations of approaches in terms of technologies may provide more minimum invasive outcomes for the patients in the long term.","Second is really in the area of obesity and that is still a fast growing segment where we see a lot of opportunity. Especially as you start to think about more minimally invasive surgical procedures that produce outcomes similar or close to the surgical interventions today.","I mentioned a select cardiovascular disease areas that we highlighted previously, and then obviously osteoarthritis and osteoporosis which offer many opportunities if you think about in terms of joints trauma and spine where we see interesting opportunities to get tuck-in deals that would help accelerate our growth.","So, those are some areas that we\u2019re very focused staying on right now. When you say spaces that we\u2019re not in today, if you look at it, we are the largest most comprehensive medical device business with the footprint in surgery, orthopaedics and cardiovascular.","We would obviously like to expand our cardiovascular footprint but we will do that in a strategic way where we can create some values. So there are very - lot of places that are nice adjacencies as I\u2019ve outlined that we think we can create some value through tuck-in deals more larger acquisition as well.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Thanks very much. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin","Good morning. Dominic, I'm surprised that you're putting a buyback as a third priority ahead of M&A. If you look at your PE multiple today it's about 14, 15 times, well below your pharma peers as well as your med tech peers. You have a massively under leveraged balance sheet, one of the few AAA-rated balance sheets out there. Investors clearly have been frustrated by the operating performance and the stock performance.","And I'm just curious to know, if you're so excited about the growth outlook of the business, what could be a better investment than you buying back your stock? But not $10 billion. What I'm talking about is something much more substantial that would really make an impact on your growth rate, like a leveraged buyback up to $50 billion or even higher. If you could talk about that a bit.","And also, just back to the M&A discussion, I think there's a lot of focus on getting your MD&D business back to growth. Can you talk about your thoughts on, most of the med device growth assets out there are trading at multiples well ahead of yours, and how you think about generating value by potentially acquiring some of those? Thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well Jami as you know, we\u2019ve been very consistent with our capital allocation strategy and that's based on extensive research over many years. As you know share buybacks have some incremental benefit but the data as you know is mixed on the overall outcome. And just because we did a $10 billion share buyback doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t do another one, another one and another one. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily limit it to just one that was announced today. ","Of course the big difference between M&A and share buybacks is the one thing that share buybacks don\u2019t do of course is they don\u2019t provide any incremental capability of the company, any incremental ability to innovate and be competitive in healthcare and that we places a priority over reducing the share count. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do both, I think we have the financial flexibility to do both and I think you will see us do both.","As far as being under-levered, I think these go hand-in-hand. We want to maintain financial flexibility to do the kinds of transactions that we think are going to be value creating to shareholders when those opportunities arise. So we always maintain financial flexibility just as a simple way of the way we conduct our business.","As far as getting back to growth in MD&D, through M&A and I'll obviously have Gary comment as well, when you talk about assets that seem to be highly valued, I think what's very important to realize is that none of the assets that are - that you may be referring is to highly valued has the scale and breadth of the kind of MD&D business that we have here at Johnson & Johnson.","So our ability to leverage our scale and breadth, our scientific knowhow, our engineering knowhow, the overall presence in the hospital setting with contracting and the like is probably unparalleled and very few companies despite their current valuations have that built into their valuations and we think in our hands we can possibly create more value than the business on a standalone basis.","Gary anything else do you want to add to that?","Gary Pruden","No, listen I think Jami, that is a challenge we\u2019re taking on in medical device, right which is as many companies with really large portfolio we have a mix of platform performance versus the market right. We\u2019ve got strong performance leaders in segments in surgery, cardio and ortho, but also have some opportunities where we need to accelerate our growth right in platforms like spine, trauma, energy and infection prevention.","I think we understand how to drive that growth in those areas in energy and infection prevention. We have a pipeline of new innovations which we think will accelerate our growth. In Spine and trauma we need to accelerate that pace of innovation through internal innovation and externally sourced innovations as well.","So I think we will look at opportunities both organic and inorganic to accelerate our growth rate, to drive that performance because I think that will be critical and important to the long time growth of the business.","As Dominic mentioned, with the scale of the business at $22 billion, right, accelerating our growth rate by one or two points is a very large acquisition, which any of those acquisition of that nature we would want to do that very carefully and ensure that we are creating shareholder value.","Jami Rubin","Dominic, just if I can push back for a second, clearly the track record in buybacks, just given where stock price has been over the last 10 years have been mixed, but the track record with M&A has also been mixed, such as the Synthes deal which Gary talked about during his remarks. I'm just curious to know how you think about that. But thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","You're right. Not every M&A deal works out exactly the way you would predicted it would. I think we were very clear that we thought enhancing scale in orthopaedics was important and we did so at a time quite frankly was ahead of where you now see the competitive set doing. So I think we are very pleased having done that acquisition.","We think of acquisitions as creating value over the long term and despite some market slow down we are still very confident in the growth of our overall orthopaedics business along with the trauma business that we acquired from Synthes just having the broader scale to create value.","M&A can be tricky, we work very hard to do so and do the deals in a disciplined way and to gain value from these transactions over the long term.","Jami Rubin","Thank you very much.","A \u2013 Dominic Caruso","You're welcome.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Damien Conover of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Damien Conover","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two drug related questions. One question on XARELTO Still some pretty strong growth there but it seems like a little bit of a deceleration. I wasn't sure if some new indications are really needed to reaccelerate that growth. I know there's a couple coming up in heart failure and stroke over the next couple years.","And then the second question was just on REMICADE. It looked like some declines there internationally, partly due to Japan. But I was also wondering if you could give any insights on what you're seeing in the European area with biosimilars. Thank you.","Gary Pruden","Sure, let me just say a few words on XARELTO. You may be referring to a little bit of slow down sequentially with XARELTO. I think that dynamic has to do with the donut hole that\u2019s part of the affordable care act in terms of Part D reimbursement.","So as it turns out, when people with Part D coverage reach the donut hole amount, they have more out of pocket cost to incur. We believe that's had a bit of an impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and that wouldn\u2019t be necessarily just for our product. It would be seen across other products as well.","Louise anything else to add?","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. And in addition, so over half of our sales are in Medicare Part D and as you enter the donut hole, the manufacturers out there actually pickup the portion number of the pricing by 50%. So we are seeing that impact.","Regarding REMICADE in Europe we are going to leave that Merck's to cover.","A \u2013 Dominic Caruso","I do think that although we won\u2019t comment on Merck's territory, we do have REMICADE in Canada and we have seen a very little biosimilar impact there. We still are retaining about 90% of the business and again as we have said before, these are biosimilar and not generics and there is a lot that goes into physician's decision to switch a patient and as we have said many times before also, about 70% of the patients with REMICADE seem to be well controlled with their disease.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Jayson Bedford","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to ask you about emerging markets. Your comments were a little bit more temper than your prior comments. So I am wondering first if you could give us growth in emerging markets in the quarter?","Louise Mehrotra","The emerging markets grew by 4% in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis they grew by 5%. Because there is some fluctuations between some of the tender business, et cetera in the emerging markets particularly Brazil and Russia. You're probably better to use the year-to-date numbers it\u2019s about 5% year-to-date operationally.","Q \u2013 Jayson Bedford","Okay. And I realized you mentioned the lower inventory in China on the ortho side but are you seeing the softness in emerging markets more in devices or consumers?","Dominic Caruso","I think it\u2019s very different dynamics in the emerging markets for consumers. So, for example the OTC businesses just as an example in Russia, we\u2019re doing extremely well in emerging markets, in that emerging markets with our consumer business. Whereas in China, as you know we\u2019ve had some issues there so we\u2019ve seen some slower growth in the China emerging markets.","In Medical Devices as Gary pointed out, that\u2019s typically a robust market for us in Medical Devices. It\u2019s our largest of the three businesses in emerging markets and in China in particular as Medical Devices and just particularly this quarter we had the inventory contraction that we saw from our distributors as the market has slowed down in China.","So we think that\u2019s sort of a one-time adjustment that we\u2019ve just experienced this quarter.","Q \u2013 Jayson Bedford","Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Gary you take that.","Gary Pruden ","I look by splits the business from our surgical business to orthopaedics business, I look at China as a surrogate marker. Surgical business you still see good double-digit growth rates coming into the business. The realignment of issues in orthopaedics certainly offset that, same in Brazil we still see strong high single-digit, double-digit growth coming out of the surgery business but not so much in the ortho business due to the registration issues.","So as in my comments in medical device it is slowed without question we\u2019ve seen that but again access to care growth is still growing, raising the standard in the market in terms of the medical unmet needs is still an opportunity and we still see good growth coming there albeit tempered from what it was maybe over the last 18 months.","Louise Mehrotra ","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeff Holford","Good morning. Thanks very much. I've got two questions. The first one is around INVOKANA where IMS volumes seem to have really flattened off since the FDA notice on ketoacidosis in May. Can you just talk about the product's recent performance in the US, and what is driving this, and when you hope to see an improvement or address any of those concerns that might be out there?","And then the second question is really just going back to some the M&A discussion that's been on the call. I think in the past, Dominic, you said a few times that large-scale M&A in pharma or biopharma is in the opposite direction from what you've always thought about. Is that still the case going forward, so we can probably take from that the way you talk about the ability to still do larger deals, that's most likely to be in the MD&D - ","Dominic Caruso ","Yes. Jason you broke up but I \u2013 Jeff you broke up but I think I understand where you were going. Let me just take the M&A question first and then Louise you could actually provide some color on INVOKANA. So Jeff I don\u2019t think you should read into the fact that we\u2019re adverse to doing large M&A in any of the businesses, it just has to be value creating as I have said many, many times.","When I say it is in the opposite direction of our pharma strategies you know, our pharma strategy which has been very successful has not been driven by large M&A in comparison to what you\u2019ve seen in the industry and so we\u2019re very clear that growing the business through searching for the best compound, the best innovation regardless of where it comes from and then incorporating that into our development engine and using the scientific expertise that we have in house is what has been a success story of pharma that doesn't mean it can also happen with the large M&A deal but it has been consistently very, very capital efficient and very successful in the way we\u2019ve been doing it for the last couple of years.","In terms of INVOKANA for ketoacidosis, you're right there was an FDA notice and it wasn\u2019t solely related to INVOKANA and our clinical trials for INVOKANA ketoacidosis rate was very, very low. But Louise any other comments on that?","Louise Mehrotra ","So Jeff I would like to point out that INVOKNANA did grow 91% in the quarter in U.S. I think that's pretty good. The markets consistently are growing about 7% I just looked at the trends and it\u2019s very consistent for second and third quarter.","As far as TRx's, we\u2019re at 6.3% up from 6% in the second quarter, primary care is at 5.6% up from 5.3% and the endo at 13.1% is about the same as it was in the second quarter. So I think it\u2019s doing very well.","Jeff Holford","Just as a follow-up, what I'm really referring to, when you look at the IMS data over the last two quarters or six months, there is a clear flattening off. Are you getting any feedback as to why that may be?","I'm not talking about the year-on-year growth which is obviously very strong because the product's had a very strong ramp, but very much just the recent performance and what you're seeing there.","Louise Mehrotra","To give you sequential TRxs, so I think that's the most recent that we would have, and I'm also looking at the market growth for that is at 7%. So I think we're doing fine.","And as Dominic said, it's a very low incident. It's 0.01 or 0.1 in our Phase III trials. So it\u2019s very low.","Jeff Holford","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question?","Operator","And your next question is from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Louise Mehrotra","Yes.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Bob. Good morning","Bob Hopkins","Thanks and good morning. Gary, since we have you on the call I just have two quick questions for you. The first is a follow-up on the robotics side. I was just wondering if you can give us an indication of what announcement we're going to hear over the next couple of weeks.","And then if you could also just give us a sense as to where you are with this collaboration with Google. You said it's in the development stage. Could you just give us some rough parameters of how you're thinking about commercialization? Is this one to two years? Two to three? Three to five? Just some rough sense there would be helpful. Thanks.","Gary Pruden","Thanks, Bob. So in terms of robotics, listen, I will leave the announcement to the new co of the company. They have some announcements that will be coming out in the next few weeks, so I'd like to leave the leader there to do it.","As mentioned this is a partnership between ourselves and my partner, Andy Conrad at Google Life Sciences, so new company will make that announcement. In terms of the development stage, yes, we were in the phase where we are integrating right, our technology with the Google technology, right, in terms of from a systems engineering perspective, integrating informatics into the design of our robot.","So we are looking, I would say you're on the earlier side of your range, right. I would say it's the next couple years. We'd obviously like to accelerate that, but we want to make sure that we stay true to our value proposition, which is we think what's available today is really the model that's more like the mainframe computer 50 years ago.","We intend to go to the iPad version and that's what we want to launch. With a more integrated informatics diagnostics, right, that are available for the surgeon around the world as a lower cost to serve.","So we think that it's better to do it right. There will be a lot of follow-on competitors that come in the next couple years that I think will be more big box players. That is clearly not our strategy.","And we think this is an opportunity to be disruptive in a very unique partnership to create value for our customers, patients and also for the Johnson & Johnson shareholders.","Louise Mehrotra","Last and final question and then we'll have some final remarks by Dominic.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question is from Tony Butler of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler","Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to, Gary, echo one of Bob's questions and that is simply around robotics. I'm very respectful of the reduced cost to serve. But the real question becomes in the end game outside of the intellectual capital the two companies put together and come up with a fix.","The question really becomes is there enough capacity for capital expense from the customers in the future, as you alluded to earlier most of the big boxes are really in developed markets.","But if you think about this globally which I'm sure you are, then the question becomes is there sufficient capital at institutions today, especially in China, et cetera, that can actually deploy a robotics technology in the future?","And my last question really, Dominic, is back to M&A again, sorry. But it \u2013 I actually - you alluded to pharma and the partnerships you've created have been great. I think I actually would have assumed that the speed which those partnerships would occur would actually escalate in part because of your capital that you currently have, and because the landscape is changing, certainly especially true in oncology? Any commentary would be great? Thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","Robotics?","Gary Pruden","Yes. So thank you for the question. And listen, I think that question is an age old question that goes on which is, will there be enough capital to support innovation? I think the end of the day the answer is always yes.","The other thing that I'll point out is, we don't believe that capital play here for our innovation is going to be $2 million per hospital. So we're going to provide a lot more flexibility in terms of that and also quite frankly depends on our go-to-market model, right, in terms of how we bring that to market.","So I think you might find some unique ways in order to do that. We haven't quite decided on that at this point. But as mentioned we have decided in terms of our value proposition which will be a lower cost to serve, a smaller footprint and we do believe that if you produced innovation, right, that delivers meaningful outcomes and improvement for patients, there will be enough capital out there globally to support that.","Dominic Caruso","Tony, with respect to M&A and pharma and your comment about the speed at which we can do partnerships and maybe you thought we would accelerate them, we're always actively involved in this space, not only in oncology, but in all the therapeutic areas that we operate in.","And as you know we already have a pretty robust pipeline where we're going to be filing 10 new NMEs between now and 2015, some of those of course come from the various partnerships and licenses that we've done.","So you'll continue to see us do that. I think accelerating those is something we always love to do, but we want to do the right deal with the right partner at the right value and getting the deal done right is probably more important.","Tony Butler","Okay. Thanks, Dominic. Thanks, Gary.","Dominic Caruso","Sure. You're welcome, Tony. Well, thanks everyone for tuning in today. Thanks, Louise and thanks, Gary, for giving us an update on our medical device business and strategies to accelerate growth. I'd just like to reiterate we're very pleased that we're able to announce a $10 billion share buyback program while we continue to actively look to put our financial strength to use to further accelerate our growth. So thanks again for tuning in today and have a very nice day. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. This is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2012. Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals Group; and Dr. Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer and Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals Group. A few logistics before we get into the details.","This call is being made available to a broader audience via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations\u2019 section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the third quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the third quarter results and discuss guidance for the full year of 2012. Following Dominic\u2019s remarks, Joaquin and Paul will provide a brief update on the pharmaceuticals business. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately an hour and a half.","Included with the press release that was sent to the investment community earlier this morning is a schedule showing sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These are also available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note this webcast includes slides. The slides are available on the website.","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2011 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The 10-K is available through the company or online.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations\u2019 section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","Lastly, today we will be discussing new molecular entities or NMEs and line extensions based on the company\u2019s current knowledge of the status of development. NMEs and line extensions are subject to the challenges and difficulties inherent in product development. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. A number of the compounds and products discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These slides list the acknowledgment of those relationships.","Now I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2012. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let\u2019s begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.1 billion for the third quarter of 2012, up 6.5% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. On an operational basis, sales were up 10.8% and currency had a negative impact of 4.3%.","The acquisition of Synthes was completed in the second quarter this year. In the third quarter, the acquisition net of the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business contributed 5.8% to the worldwide operational sales growth. The impact to the U.S. and outside the U.S. growth was 7.2 points, and 4.8 points respectively. In the U.S., sales were up 13.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 8.9% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 7.5 points.","The western hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 12.8% operationally while the Asia Pacific Africa region grew 9% on an operational basis. Europe grew 7.1% operationally. The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made strong contributions to the results in all regions.","If you\u2019ll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings attributable to Johnson & Johnson were $3 billion compared to 3.2 billion dollars in the same period of 2011. Earnings per share were $1.05 versus $1.15 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the accompanying table on non-GAAP measures, 2012 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of noncash net charges related to in-process research and development due to the discontinuation of the Phase III clinical development of Bapineuzumab IV, transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Synthes, Inc., and a few ASR hip replacement costs.","Third quarter 2011 net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of a mark-to-market adjustment to the value of the currency option and deal costs related to the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. Excluding these special items, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.25 representing increases of 2.3% and 0.8% respectively as compared to the same period in 2011.","I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. For the third quarter of 2012, cost of goods sold at 32.8% was up 110 basis points from the same period last year primarily due to an inventory step-up charge related to the Synthes acquisition. Excluding the inventory step-up charge, which has been treated as a special item, cost of goods sold increased 20 basis points versus the same period last year, primarily due to ongoing remediation costs in our consumer business.","Third quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses at 30.6% of sales were down 210 basis points due to cost containment initiatives across many of our businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 11.3%, 20 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2011 primarily due to the timing of milestone payments in our pharmaceutical business. Interest expense net of interest income of $120 million was up $3 million for just the third quarter of 2011. Other income net of other expense was $90 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $308 million in the same period last year.","Excluding special items, other income net of other expense of $175 million was $449 million less than 2011 due to lower gains on divestitures. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 22.2% in the third quarter of 2012, in line with 2011.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the third quarter of 2012. I\u2019ll begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide consumer segment sales for the third quarter of 2012 of $3.6 billion decreased 4.3% compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 1% while the impact of currency was negative 5.3%.","U.S. sales were down 0.4% while international sales grew 1.8% on an operational basis. Baby care products decreased on an operational basis by 1.9% when compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower international sales of lotions and creams, partially offset by strong growth of hair care products. Sales in the oral care business increased 3% operationally due to strong sales outside the U.S. from newly launched Listerine products.","For the third quarter of 2012, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 5.9% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2011 with U.S. sales up 5.7% and sales outside the U.S. up 6% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. increased primarily due to the relaunch of selected key products and the impact of the acquisition of full ownership rights to certain digestive health products partially offset by supply constraints on other products.","McNeil PPC is operating under a consent decree covering the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and Fort Washington and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McNeil continues to operate the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras and Lancaster. As previously discussed, production volumes from these facilities continued to be impacted by additional review and approval processes. We expect this to continue throughout 2012 and most of 2013. Plants operating under the consent decree are producing a simplified portfolio focused on key brands.","Our Skin Care business grew 0.2% on an operational basis in the third quarter of 2012 with the U.S. up 3.7% due to strong performance of Neutrogena. Sales outside the U.S. were down 2.2% due to competitive and marketplace pressures.","Women\u2019s Health declined 3.2% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. were down 22.1% while sales outside the U.S. were up 2.3% on an operational basis. The sales decline this quarter was primarily due to the divestiture of Monistat in August last year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, sales were flat. Wound Care Other sales decreased 3.6% on an operational basis compared to the same period last year due to competitive pressures.","That completes our review of the consumer segment and I\u2019ll now review highlights for the pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide net sales for the third quarter of $6.4 billion increased 7% versus same period last year. An on operational basis, sales increased 11.3% with a negative currency impact of 4.3 points. Sales in the U.S. increased 14.6% while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 8.2%.","Now reviewing sales for the major therapeutic areas. Immunology products achieved strong double-digit operational sales growth of 19.8%. Sales in the U.S. increased 15.1% while sales outside the U.S. increased 37.1% operationally. On operational basis, STELARA was up 56.4% with the U.S. up 57.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 39.5% operationally. The strong results were due primarily to market share gains complemented by strong market growth in all major regions.","SIMPONI was up 47.9% operationally with U.S. sales up 57.6%. Strong market growth and increased market share accounted for approximately half of the U.S. growth with timing for certain items accounting for the balance. In the quarter, sales outside the U.S. were up 39.7% on an operational basis primarily due to the continued success of the launch in Japan.","REMICADE grew 14.3% on an operational basis. The U.S. was up 7.3% with approximately half the growth due to changes in wholesaler inventory levels and the remainder due to a strong double-digit market growth partially offset by lower market share. Combined export and international sales grew approximately 25% on an operational basis with customer inventory planning contributing approximately 60% of the operational growth in the quarter.","With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. Sales of infectious disease products increased 18.6% on an operational basis. Continued momentum in market share growth of PREZISTA and insulins for HIV was partially offset by lower sales of vaccines.","INCIVO, a treatment for hepatitis C, contributed approximately half of the infectious disease worldwide operational growth in the quarter. On a sequential basis, INCIVO sale were down primarily due to seasonality in treatment patterns in Europe, impacting new patient starts in the summer months. Sales accelerated significantly in September.","Neuroscience product sales increased 3.3% on an operational basis. Growth was impacted by generic competition for CONCERTA, Rasadyne, RISPERDAL and DURAGESIC. The long acting injectable antipsychotics RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, or Zeplion, achieved operational growth of nearly 20% due to an increase in combined market share. INVEGA sales outside the U.S. achieved operational growth of 26.9% primarily due to the strong growth in Japan.","Sales of oncology products increased 36.2% on an operational basis due to the very strong results for Zytiga and VELCADE partially offset by lower sales for Doxil\/Caelyx related to manufacturing issues at a third-party supplier. Zytiga is currently approved to treat chemo refractory methastoic castration resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, Zytiga achieved sales of $265 million. On a sequential basis, reported sales increased just under 15%. Velcade is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Operational sales increased 20.7% on an operational basis due to continued strong performance in patient share in the frontline setting.","Doxil\/Caelyx declined 80.4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We have been working diligently to restore a reliable supply of Doxil, and as announced yesterday, full access in the U.S. has commenced. In the E.U., we expect Caelyx to be available in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in non-E.U. countries the timing is projected to be the first quarter of 2013.","Other pharmaceutical products declined 3.3% on an operational basis due to divestitures and lower sales of EPREX, ands osofectperrett due primarily to the impact of generic competition. Positively impacting results XARELTO sales grew 40% on a sequential basis contributing over two points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate.","On the pipeline front, during the quarter Zytiga was granted priority review by the FDA for the chemo naive filing, petaqualine to treat pulmonary multi drug resistance tuberculosis was filed in Europe and granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA approved new Synthes ER for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Dockogen was approved in the European union for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, SIMPONI IV was submitted to the FDA for treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and subcutaneous Velcade was approved in the U.E. for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","That completes a review of the Pharmaceutical segment. I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment sales of $7.1 billion grew 16.1% operationally as compared to the same period in 2011. Currency had a negative impact of 3.6 points resulting in a total sales increase of 12.5%. Sales excluding the net impact of Synthes were up 1.4% on an operational basis with U.S. sales up 0.4% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.2% on an operational basis.","Now turning to the MD&D business starting with the Cardiovascular Care. Cardiovascular Care sales were down 2.7% operationally with the U.S. down 1.5% and sales outside the U.S. down 3.3% operationally. Excluding the impact of drug-eluting stents, worldwide sales were up approximately 3.5% operationally due to strong results for Biosense Webster, partially offset by lower sales of endovascular products due to the impact of a supply disruption that was a result late in the third as well as competitive launches.","Biosense Webster achieved worldwide operational growth of over 20% in the quarter driven by strong market share growth. The success of the new thermaco catheter launches made strong contributions to the results.","The Diabetes Care business operational sales declined 1.1% in the third quarter of 2012 with the U.S. business down 3% due to a decline in both mail order and hospital sales. The business outside the U.S. grew 0.8% operationally with strong sales in emerging markets partially offset by lower sales in some of the developed markets.","The Diagnostics business declined 1.9% on an operational basis with the U.S. down 3.4% and sales outside the U.S. down 0.5% operationally in the third quarter. Sales were impacted by lower donor screening sales due to competitive pressures, and the divestiture of the Rogaine business during the third quarter.","Infection prevention grew 9% on an operational basis with similar results both in and outside the U.S.: The breadth of the install base strong consumables growth.","Orthopedic sales were up 68.6% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding the impact of Synthes and the divestiture in December 2011 of certain neurosurgical instruments, sales grew approximately 2.5% on operational basis with similar results both in and outside the U.S. Operationally, hips were up 3% worldwide driven by 6% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem platform sales partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were flat with soft sales in Europe offsetting gains in other regions. Competitive pressures and the softer market impacted growth in Europe.","Knees worldwide increased 3% on an operational basis with the U.S. up 6% driven by fixed bearing and revision platforms. Sales outside the U.S. were flat due to softer sales primarily in Europe due to competitive pressure. Including the Synthes business in both periods and excluding the divested DePuy trauma business in both periods, trauma grew approximately 4% on an operational basis with the U.S. up 1% and sales outside the U.S. up 7% on an operational basis. U.S. growth was impacted by shipping patterns.","Including the Synthes business in both periods, worldwide spine was down 3% on an operational basis with the U.S. down approximately 6% with continued pressure on price. Outside the U.S., sales grew approximately 1% operationally. Specialty surgery achieved operational growth of 7.2% in the third quarter of 2012 with the U.S. sales up 5.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 9.1% on an operational basis.","Sales from the acquisition of SterilMed and strong biosurgery products and international sales of energy products were the major drivers of growth this quarter. Surgical care worldwide sales grew operationally by 0.1% with the U.S. down 1.1% and sales outside the U.S. up 0.9% operationally. The success of new product launches, SECURESTRAP, PHYSIOMESH, and the ECHELON FLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler were offset by lower sales of mechanical products and pelvic floor repair products.","On September 28th, Ethicon received a complete response letter from the FDA on the biologics license application for the Fibrin Pad with questions specific to product labeling. On October 5th, final labeling was agreed to with the FDA and the response was submitted. We expect to hear from the FDA in the near future.","Rounding out the review of the medical devices and diagnostic segment our Vision Care business achieved operational sales growth of 4.4% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 3.6% while sales outside the U.S. increased 4.8% on an operational basis. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses. That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostic segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter of 2012.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone. I would like to provide some additional comments about our third quarter results, highlight a few recent business and pipeline developments, and then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the remainder of 2012. Then I will turn over the call to Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels who will provide an update on the pharmaceutical business and pipeline.","Let me first begin by sharing my view of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter results, which Louise has reviewed for you. Despite continuing marketplace and economic pressures, we reported solid sales growth in the third quarter of 6.5%, which was slightly higher than analyst estimates as published by first call. Foreign currency, in particular the weak euro, continues to negatively impact sales results. Third quarter sales on an operational basis excluding the impact of unfavorable currency grew 10.8%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 4.3%.","Sales included the impact of the recently completed acquisition of Synthes, which contributed 5.8% to worldwide operational growth net of the divestiture of the DePuy trauma business. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Synthes, the underlying global business grew by approximately 5% on an operational basis. Also, excluding special items this quarter, we delivered solid earnings per share of $1.25, which exceeded analyst estimates.","Turning to market conditions, in the U.S., healthcare utilization rates, primarily hospital admissions and surgeries, show early signs of stabilization, and U.S. joint reconstruction volumes appear to have improved in the latest data that we have. While some positive signs can be seen, these signs are still too early to signal any meaningful recovery. Adapting to this change in environment is important and our leaders continue to apply financial discipline to our operations while investing in key growth opportunities.","Let me take a moment to provide some detail on special items in the third quarter. We recorded several special items totaling approximately $550 million after tax that reduced reported net earnings for the quarter. In August, we announced that we would be taking a charge in the third quarter for the discontinuation of the Phase III clinical development of Bapineuzumab IV in mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","That amounted to a net charge of $340 million, consisting of a $679 million charge for the write-off of in-process research and development, offset by the approximately 50% share of that cost, which is attributable to our partner in the program. As we described during the announcement of the closing of the Synthes acquisition, we expected to incur additional special charges throughout 2012. And in the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $135 million consisting of transaction and integration costs.","And finally, we also recorded a $94 million after tax increase in the accrual for DePuy ASR hip related costs, based on updated international registry information.","Louise has already updated you on developments in the consumer business, and I would just note a few business milestones for the medical device and diagnostic business for the quarter and I\u2019ll leave the pharmaceutical highlights to Paul and Joaquin.","In MD&D this quarter, we launched several new products with significant benefits most notably in areas of energy and orthopedics. The new 45-millimeter version of the Echelon Flex Power ENDOPATH Stapler was launched. This new 45-millimeter design allows surgeons to have more control near vital structures such as in the thorax. The new Endura tip solutions, a new system of instruments and devices, marks our entry into the rapidly growing field of hip arthroscopy.","These are a few recent highlights, and on November 1 we will provide a more in-depth review of our medical devices and diagnostics businesses as part of our annual business review with the investment community. At that meeting, the three heads of our MD&D business groups, Global Surgery, Global Medical Solutions, and Global Orthopedics, will update you on our exciting product offerings and the strategic direction of their respective businesses. I certainly hope you can join us for that meeting.","Let me now provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for the rest of 2012. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $2.9 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $19.8 billion of cash and investments and approximately $16.9 billion of debt. And we continue to generate strong cash flows. For purposes of your models, assuming no additional major acquisitions during 2012, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $500 million and $550 million, consistent with our previous guidance.","Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales, or write-offs. This account is difficult to forecast due to the nature of some of these items. Assuming no major additional items of this nature, I would recommend that you consider modeling other income and expense for 2012 as a net gain excluding special items ranging from approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion, slightly higher than our previous guidance.","And now a word on taxes. On a year-to-date basis through the third quarter of 2012, the company\u2019s effective tax rate excluding special items was 22.2%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2012 in the range of 21% to 22%, consistent with our previous guidance, and this assumes the extension of the research and development tax credit later in the year.","Now turning to sales and earnings guidance. Our guidance continues to be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations, assuming that average currency rates for 2012 will be the same as they were for 2011. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this operational view provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also continue to provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2012 with the impact that current exchange rates could have, and we\u2019ll use the euro as an example.","So turning to sales, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between approximately 5.5% to 6.5% for the year. This is consistent with our previous guidance as our business continues to build the momentum we had expected. This would result in estimated sales for 2012 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $68.6 billion and $69.3 billion. While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements to give you an idea of the potential impact of currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2012 were to say where they were as of last week, as an example with the Euro at approximately $1.29, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% for the year. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 3% and 4% for the year for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $67 million and 67.6 billion dollars.","And now turning to earnings, I suggest that you consider full-year 2012 operational EPS estimates of between $5.27 and $5.32 per share which excludes the impact of special items and assumes the same average exchange rates for 2012 as we saw in 2011. While we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for the balance of 2012 were to remain where they were as of last week, then the impact of currency movements, primarily the Euro would be unfavorable by approximately $0.22 per share.","Therefore our reported EPS excluding special items would be between $5.05 and $5.10 per share. This is slightly higher than our previous guidance, assuming that the recent strengthening of the Euro holds up, and reflects tightening of the range at this late stage in the year.","On a final note, I\u2019d like to point out that as you update your models for the guidance we provided, you should see pre-tax operating margins for 2012 improve between 100 and 150 basis points, even with the incremental amortization expense related to Synthes. Operating margin expansion can certainly vary from year to year, but we are certainly pleased with our progress this year. That concludes my comments on our operational performance this quarter and our guidance with respect to your models.","In summary we are very pleased with the third quarter results, and we expect to continue on our core strengths, recent launches, and ongoing investments to build for future growth. I remain confident in our prospects for the remainder of this year and beyond, thanks to the dedication and focus and integrity of the people at Johnson & Johnson.","And now I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to introduce the two leaders of our Pharmaceuticals Group Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman of the Pharmaceutical Groups; and Dr. Paul Stoffels, Worldwide Chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Group and recently appointed to the role of Chief Scientific Officer for Johnson & Johnson. These two leaders long with the many talented and dedicated people in our pharmaceuticals group have made our business one of the fastest growing in the pharmaceutical industry. They have been instrumental in selecting and developing great compounds and have launched them in a challenging marketplace with excellence. They have also positioned the business very well for continued growth.","It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Joaquin.","Joaquin Duato","Thanks, Dominic, and good morning, everyone. My name is Joaquin Duato and I am the Worldwide Chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Group at Johnson & Johnson, a responsibility I share with Paul Stoffels. This is an exciting time for Johnson, a time of transformation for our business, a time of impacting the lives of patients with an unprecedented number of innovative medicines. Pharmaceuticals is a dynamic global market valued at $950 billion and expected to grow to more than $1.2 trillion by 2016. This growth is driven by volume increases in emerging markets and a spending uptick in developed nations. Our focus and efforts are paying off as we continue to build momentum with an industry-leading portfolio.","Across our core therapeutic areas we are delivering robust growth and outpacing the markets where we compete. We have launched eight new products since 2009, achieving a strong track record of success and generating excellent results through best in class commercial capabilities. We are also expanding our global presence by broadening our geographic reach to include emerging markets and Japan. At the core of our success are the people of Johnson, committed to the values of Our Credo and caring for the world one person at a time.","Our momentum is driven by disciplined decision-making and an aligned strategy around four areas: creating value through innovation, global reach with local focus, excellence in execution, and leading with purpose. We will use this framework to update you on the progress of our Johnson business. So let\u2019s begin with creating value through innovation.","With 11.3% operational growth in Q3, we have changed the trajectory of our business achieving ten quarters of consecutive growth. We are transforming our pro portfolio. Our new products are projected to comprise 40% of our sales by 2016. You\u2019ll note a healthy balance of mature brands, core growth products, and new launches.","As you can see, we are driving growth across all of our key therapeutic areas, reflecting our underlying strength. Our Immunology franchise, our largest, is growing operationally at 19%. After acquiring the rights of REMICADE and SIMPONI in 150 territories, we are expanding our worldwide leadership in immunogly. We now manage two-thirds of REMICADE and SIMPONI global sales. And in the U.S., we are the market leaders with approximately 33% share.","Our long-acting antipsychotic franchise including INVEGA SUSTENNA known as Sepion in many markets outside of the U.S. and RISPERDAL CONSTA is growing 18%, exceeding category growth in the broad antipsychotics market. In Oncology, continuous growth of bellkad and the very rapid uptick of Zytiga have helped us realize 29% growth. In addition, we are restoring full access to Doxil and working to","reestablish its reliable supply.","Our global HIV business is up 28%, thanks to the continued growth of PREZISTA INTELENCE, EDURANT and the combination product complata. Currently one in three U.S. patients were treated with a new HIV regimen as prescribed at Johnson\u2019s therapeutic medication. Let\u2019s now briefly review some of our leading products.","With 16 regulatory approvals, REMICADE is our largest brand, and we continue to expand its indications. Earlier this year, we received approval in the E.U. for pediatric ulcerative colitis. 1.7 million patients have been treated with REMICADE worldwide, and in October, we marked a U.S. milestone, having treated one million patients. Our marketplace position remains solid, with more than 75% share of the U.S. infusible market for immunology products. With sales of 4.6 billion year-to-date, REMICADE is sustaining growth at 15.1% globally with 8.5% in the U.S. and 25% quarter-to-date in the reacquired territories.","Our exclusivity runs until 2018 in the U.S. and in the majority of the E.U. countries, we recently filed for an additional six-month extension of our patent turn related to pediatric studies. If granted this would extend our patent exclusivity of REMICADE to mid February of 2015 from August 2014.","At the end of 2009, we launch Estalada for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Reducing therapy from 28 a week to 4 injections a year. We are very proud that this game changing therapy was awarded the International (inaudible) earlier this month.","Year-to-date STELARA sales were $756 million, growing at 46%. Physician acceptance is increasing as STELARA has 25.4% share in the U.S. dermatology market, up three points from a year ago. Uniquely our five-year efficacy and safety data represents the longest continuous study of a psoriasis biologic treatment. And we continue to invest in STELARA with Phase III programs underway in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease.","And now a brief update about SIMPONI. With 50% operational growth and sales of $452 million, SIMPONI is building momentum with expanded indications and a new formulation on the horizon. It is currently approved in 57 countries for rheumatic diseases and we recently launched in Japan with a strong uptake. We are excited about this product\u2019s potential. We have submitted applications in the U.S. and Europe for ulcerative colitis via subcutaneous injection and for the approval of an intravenous formulation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, if approved, SIMPONI will be the only entity available in both subcutaneous and intravenous formulation.","Let\u2019s move into our reinvigorated long-acting injectable franchise. We launched INVEGA SUSTENNA in the U.S. in 2009, and it is now approved in 37 countries outside of the U.S. In many markets, under the name Sepion. The successful launch of INVEGA SUSTENNA has accelerated the growth of our long-acting antipsychotic franchise from mid single digits to 18% year to date. We have seen significant expansion of our prescriber and patient base, many of whom are new to the long-acting antipsychotics category. Based on the success of our once-a-month injection, clinical development of a three-month formulation of INVEGA SUSTENNA is currently underway.","We are very pleased with the performance of ZYTIGA. With sales of $697 million year-to-date, ZYTIGA is the most successful global oral oncology launch ever. Since its first approval in the U.S. for metastatic prostate cancer in April 2011, ZYTIGA is now approved in more than 50 countries around the world. Physician uptake has been remarkable. The number of post chemo patients treated has grown to 75% from 40% at the time of launch. More than 30,000 patients have received treatments since 2011. Our estimated patient share in the U.S. chemo refractory market is approximately 67% and in the G5, it\u2019s approximately 81%. We are now expecting responses from the FDA and EMEA on our pre-chemo indication, which will triple the eligible patient population.","Now on to VELCADE. This first in class treatment for multiple myeloma has approximately 36% share outside the U.S. and is growing 16% with almost $1 billion in sales year-to-date. VELCADE was recently approved for subcutaneous administration in Europe and Canada. We also have ongoing clinical studies in other hematological cancers such as Mantle Cell Lyphoma.","Let\u2019s review infectious diseases and virology. PREZISTA is now approved in more than 100 countries worldwide with robust 24% operational growth. It is the leading protease inhibitor in Europe and is ranked number two in the U.S. We are now awaiting the approval of our single 800-milligram tablet.","Moving from PREZISTA to INCIVO, our hepatitis C treatment approved in Europe in 2011. INCIVO achieved reimbursement more than 100 days faster than the European benchmark. Following strong initial uptake, we experienced a slow-down in sales during the summer season. Now we are regaining traction as market activities stabilizes. We have already seen a pickup in September. INCIVO has achieved 67% market share and continues to maintain a strong lead over Procepravil across Europe.","Finally let\u2019s talk about XARELTO. First approved in 2011, XARELTO has the broadest indication profile of any of the newer oral anticoagulants with additional indication spending regulatory approval for the treatment and long-term prevention of deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism and to reduce the risk of secondary cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome in combination with the standard and the platelet therapy. According to IMS, XARELTO has overtaken prevaksa and is now capturing 53% of new-to-brand share of the NEVO oral anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.","Additionally, based on our profitability, attitudes and use of September survey, XARELTO is the number one brand preferred by cardiologists. Ahead not only of prevaksa but also of Warfarin. XARELTO continues to make positive gains in access with 93% commercial formularies and 90% of lives in Medicare party. I hope this brief summary of our key products reinforces the strong performance of our portfolio.","Now let\u2019s move on to how we are extending our global reach with local focus. Our global presence is broadening. In 2006, sales outside of the U.S. accounted for 35% of our worldwide revenue. By 2011, they comprised 51% of our total sales. Emerging markets are playing an important role in our global growth. With a five-year growth of 15%, markets such as China, Brazil, Russia, India, and others now comprise 14% of our worldwide sales. In China, we expect strong growth due to a number of factors. These include our leadership position in over-the-counter products, the expected growth of CNS oncology and immunology franchises, and the expansion of China-based manufacturing and R&D capabilities. For example, we have had the first NME declaration by a China based team.","We are also making inroads in Brazil. Strong performances from REMICADE and VELCADE are helping to drive double digit growth, twice that of the market. We will have launched five new products in Brazil between 2011 and 2012. And in Russia, we are ranked number two in the reimburse market. In addition to broadening our base of new products, we are forging innovative partnerships with local companies such as the full cycle technology transfer product for VELCADE.","Now let\u2019s talk about excellence in execution. Matching superior science with industry leading commercial capabilities is at the core of our success. Our results reflect our expertise in market access, launch readiness, care integration, and customer engagement. In the U.S. we hold the leadership position in total sales of new products launched during the last three years. In 2012, eight out of 12 of our euro sales forces were voted best in class by our physician customers while payers selected us as department of choice in specialty pharmaceuticals.","In EMEA Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Johnson is the fastest growing among the top 20 companies in the first half of 2012. Consistent with this performance, net promoted course for Johnson in Europe grew seven points and we are the preferred company among our competitive set with investigators, payers, and physicians.","Japan is a priority market for Johnson. We have launched six new products in Japan in the past two years with very good results. And we are the fastest growing company in Japan among the top 25.","So before I hand it over to Paul, I want to quickly summarize a few points about our strategy and results. We have changed the trajectory of our business with ten consecutive quarters of growth, the latest rate at 11.3%. We continue to build momentum across our core franchises, outpacing many of the markets where we compete. We are leading in the industry in sales of new products, and we are broadening our global reach in key geographies beyond the U.S. and Europe. It\u2019s the people of Johnson around the world who are critical to our success. They make a meaningful difference in patients\u2019 lives every day.","Paul?","Paul Stoffels","Thank you, Joaquin, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure today to discuss with you our pipeline and R&D strategy, and give you an overview of our enterprise approach to innovation. As leading healthcare company in the world, we believe that innovation is a critical driver for future growth. A key mandate in my new role will be to further develop the innovation agenda for Johnson & Johnson.","Our enterprise approach will focus on several key elements: An end-to-end R&D strategy focused on the highest needs and leverage deep medical expertise and scientific know how to select winners. Accessing the best science and technology through internal research or external innovation. By being agnostic to where the innovation comes from, we will access a diversity of innovation and meet a high threshold with products that exceeds market expectations. We will leverage our global development operations to increase efficiency, cost effectiveness and flexibility and ensure quality.","As a broadly-based healthcare company focused on three different sectors, we have world class talent and expertise and capabilities in multiple areas of science and technology. One of my key mandates will be to leverage those capabilities across the three sectors for maximum impact on healthcare.","In pharmaceuticals, we take a therapeutic area end-to-end approach for all compounds in our pipeline. We focus on five therapeutic areas: Neuroscience, Cardiovascular Metabolism, Immunology and Oncology, and Infectious Diseases. Within that\u2019s therapeutic areas we focus on specific diseases with the most important and highest unmet needs.","Our vision is to transform patients\u2019 lives by discovering and developing innovative solutions in each of these disease areas. We do this by identifying the medical needs, accessing the best science internal or external, and combining this with operational excellence. In 2011, we advanced our portfolio in a significant way with approval and launch of five new different shades of drugs. Zytiga for chemo refractory prostate cancer, INCIVO, once daily treatment for HIV, INCIVO, a novel treatment for hepatitis C, Xarelto for prophylaxis and for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and Synthes ER for chronic pain.","With these new medicines and our strong existing brands, we have built an industry leading portfolio of new and differentiated medicines. We also have worked to build an exciting and robust late stage pipeline of new and differentiated medicines. It features a healthy mix of NMEs with differentiated profiles and several major line extensions of drugs we launched in the past two years. I\u2019ll highlight a few of these in more detail.","Chemically frozen for Type 2 diabetes, seen a preview of TMC 435 for chronic hepatitis C and PCI 32765 for approved for P-cell malignancies. Chemically frozen is a novel SGLT-2 inhibitor. It has an attractive clinical profile, has a potential convenient oral once daily agent. It acts uniquely on the kidney and has shown in studies to lower glucose by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the kidneys and contribute to weight loss through secretion of glucose. It is a potential first choice for add-on therapy to metformin.","Our Phase III program forcana is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of chemically frozen across the spectrum of beta cell function and in broad patient types. To support this, we are fully enrolled nine Phase III pivotal clinical studies encompassing more than 10,300 patients. This includes the cardiovascular study canvass.","Canvass is a large prospective study enrolling more than 4,400 patients to assess the glycemic efficacy and safety of chemically frozen in Type 2 diabetes patients, who are also at high risk or have a history","of cardiovascular disease. We recently presented results from this trial, which showed that chemically frozen lowered blood sugar levels when used as an add-on therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes who were treated with insulin and who had a greater risk for cardiovascular disease.","Chemically frozen was also effective and well tolerated in patients with Type 2 diabetes age 55 to 80 in a separate Phase III studies. These data were represented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Meeting in Berlin earlier this month. We filed an MDA in the U.S. in May, and an MAA in Europe in June, and also filed a multiple additional countries simultaneously following these submissions. We look forward to working with the regulatory authorities on approval for these indications.","Let me now turn to SIMEPRAVIVE, or TMC 435, which is a potential best in class protease inhibitor for chronic hepatitis C. The compound, which we are codeveloping with Medaviv, is suitable for one pill once a day administration. It significantly improved viral cure rates in Phase IIb studies in both treatment naive and treatment failure patients.","Earlier this year we presented final results from our Phase IIb ASPIRE study in which we evaluated 435 as an additional to pegalated Interferon and Ribfarin in patients with genotype I chronic hepatitis C. These patients had failed prior treatment with pegalated Interferon and Ribfarin either because they had relapsed, had a partial response, or had no response. TMC 435 based therapy significantly improved viral cure rates in each of these patient subgroups.","Our global Phase III trials for TMC 435 are currently ongoing. We have two Phase III trials in naive patients and one in relapsing patients. In addition, we have a Phase III study ongoing in non-responders and studies ongoing in Japan. While protease inhibitors are an important milestone in hepatitis C treatment, the ultimate goal is the development of Interferon free regimens. We have several programs under development to explore Interferon free regimens, including two Phase II studies exploring combination regimens of SIMEPRAVIVE with 7977 from Killiat and an NS5a from BMS.","Needless to say, we are excited about SIMEPRAVIVE for which we have worldwide marketing rights with the exception of the Nordic countries. We are targeting filing in the first half of 2013 in the U.S. and Europe and Japan.","Finally, let me spend a few minutes on Eguitamib, or PCI 32765, an anticancer compound that we are jointly developing with Pharmacyclics. It is a potentially new form of oral therapy for P-cell malignancies and we will be pursuing multiple indications across a panel of P-cell malignancies. Pharmacyclics and Johnson initiated several studies which are enrolling now: a Phase II study in Mantle Cell leukemia, and two Phase III studies for relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocitic leukemia. In addition, a number of Phase I and II studies with Eguitamib are ongoing across a panel of indications.","With the introduction of several new drugs over the past two years, we also have significant major line extensions that we are pursuing. We are following on our success with REMICADE, which grew from an orphan indication to 16 different indications, and taking a similar approach to many of our products in other therapeutic areas. These products begin with targeted therapies in small indications and grow over time with expanding indications to be pipelines within a product.","Let me highlight a few here on the slide. We are excited by the three-month formulation of INVEGA SUSTENNA for schizophrenia, which has the potential to keep symptoms under control with only four injections per year. We anticipate filing in 2014 in the U.S. and in 2015 in Europe.","With XARELTO we are pursuing multiple additional indications including VTE treatment in acute coronary syndrome, both delivering important advances to large populations. XARELTO has the broadest profile of the new oral anticoagulants in the U.S.","With SIMPONI, we are pursuing IV formulation for rheumatoid arthritis and additional indications in ulcerative colitis and juvenile ideopathic arthritis.","With STELARA, we expect to file for additional indications including psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. We anticipate filing for psoriatic arthritis in the fourth quarter of 2012 for both U.S. and Europe and for Crohn\u2019s disease in 2015 in the U.S. and Europe.","Finally, with ZYTIGA, we are pursuing broader indications in chemo naive metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer and metastatic breast cancer. We are excited about all of these indications and their potential to address large unmet needs in patients worldwide.","A key part of our strategy is to access the best science through internal research or external innovation. In the first half of this year, we have established more than 30 different collaborations. Let me highlight three new deals that we announced recently.","In June, we acquired Core-Immune and gained access to a compound in early clinical development for heart failure. In August we signed an exclusive worldwide licensing and development agreement with GenMap for their Atunomap, a human CD38 monoclonal antibody currently in development for multiple myeloma. And earlier this month, we also signed an agreement with Astellas Pharmaceuticals to gain exclusive worldwide right, except Japan, to develop and commercialize a novel JAK inhibitor, ASP015K. The compound is currently in Phase IIb for rheumatoid arthritis.","At Johnson & Johnson, sustaining our position as a leading global healthcare company requires continuous access to the best science and technology in the world. Last month we announced plans to establish regional innovation centers as part of a novel approach to accelerate early innovation in all three sectors of Johnson & Johnson. Each innovation center will house science and technology experts focused on identifying early stage innovation academia and small biotech and have local deal-making capabilities with flexibility to adapt deal structures to match the early stage opportunity.","Our J&J innovation centers will be located in the world\u2019s leading innovation hot spots so that we can become an active part of these ecosystems. We have flourished with four innovation centers in California, Massachusetts, London, and China, and we look to set up additional satellite locations as driven by business needs. Operational excellence is critical to our strategy. We have built an R&D network with world-class clinical, partnering, manufacturing, and regulatory capabilities. Over the past few years, this has helped us successfully execute massive clinical programs such as the 10,000 patient canagliflozin program and set new industry benchmarks in patient recruitment, data collection, and timelines for regulatory filings and submissions.","We have the ability to develop, file, and launch drugs simultaneously across the globe with the highest degree of quality, and we are accelerating our pipeline in China and Japan. We have excellence in safety surveillance with around the clock pharmaco vigilance capabilities and pan life cycle safety risk management for every product. Our global development organizations have helped us to significantly increase our productivity. Over the recent three-year period when looking at Phase III development and registration success, our latest development success rate continues to be at the top third for the industry and well above industry median. We are currently No. 1 in development cycle time.","We have also dramatically improved our submission cycle times while maintaining quality, resulting in a cost per NME approved which remains well below industry median. We are fortunate to be in an industry where human health is the basis of our business. In particular, at Johnson & Johnson, the benefit we generate to patients and consumers is at our core. We\u2019ve measured our success by the years of life saved and the quality of life improved. Our pipeline, products, and people are impacting human health and making a big difference for patients worldwide. We continue to enhance broad and global access to medicines through a variety of programs.","We continue our efforts to facilitate developing world access to HIV therapies and we also take pride in the fact that we are bringing the power of science for global health. We discovered, developed, and filed TMC207 at the B-drug with the first new mechanism of action in more than 40 years and have multiple efforts ongoing in HIV and vaccines for global health.","In closing our strategy is delivering. We have an industry-leading drug portfolio. We are driving growth from core brands and achieving strong growth from new products. By identifying the highest medical need and matching it with the best science, internal or external, we are delivering differentiated medicines bringing life and quality of life for patients and value for society and for our business. We execute with operational excellence to deliver products globally and competitively and with industry-leading benchmarks in efficiency, productivity, quality, and timelines. The approach has brought us back to growth in the pharmaceutical sector, and our goal is to maintain the momentum and continue delivering growth for Johnson & Johnson.","Thank you. And let me now turn it back to Louise.","Louise Mehrotra","Thanks, Paul. Stephanie, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citi.","Louise Mehrotra","Good Morning, Matt.","Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citi","Morning. Quickly just for you, Dominic, then I\u2019ll go to pharma. When you look at the gross margin, it was flat year-over-year, down a little bit quarter over quarter and you had a big performance in U.S. pharma. So I was just wondering why we didn\u2019t see a little more there.","Dominic Caruso","Right, so as Louise pointed out, Matt, the quarter includes this inventory step-up, from the acquisition of Synthes, which we\u2019ve excluded in our earnings. And so what you saw when you exclude that for the quarter \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you did that for the year-to-date basis \u2013 was just a slight uptick year-over-year of 20 basis points I think it was, Louise. And that\u2019s related to the continued remediation efforts in the Consumer business. So I don\u2019t think that gross margin excluding this impact from Synthes which will of course, you know, rotate off after all that inventory is sold, I don\u2019t think that will be a big driver one way or the other to our earnings.","Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citi","I must have missed that. I will look at that again. Thanks, guys. And Joaquin, quickly for you, can you give some comments on what you\u2019re seeing in Western Europe? You talked a lot about emerging markets, Japan, and you showed EMEA. What are you seeing in Western Europe in terms of the volumes today and where you might be seeing some pressure?","Joaquin Duato","For us, Matt, as I described in Western Europe, we are having a very positive evolution in the first half of the year. We had double-digit growth, and we are leading the industry in growth. And it\u2019s based on the strength of our launched new products in particular, INCIVO, Zytiga, and Sepion, which is the name that INVEGA SUSTENNA has outside of the U.S.","Having said that, we continue to see headwinds in most of the European countries and particularly Southern Europe, but also in Central Europe. The headwinds are in different areas. We see continued pressure on price on one side, and at the same time, we see stricter guidelines in the use of generics too, and also we see in many different countries HTA agencies coming up which are going to make access more complex and difficult.","Overall, a complex situation, very fluid, and our view is that we have to take a long-term view on that. We are pleased with our results to date, and we are confident that our portfolio is the right one for this market environment","Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citi","Thanks, Joaquin. Thanks, Dominic.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Dominic Caruso","Morning, Mike.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan","Good morning. Maybe Dominic, let me start with the big picture question before I go to pharma as well. Dominic, if we look at it from a top line perspective, the 5% organic growth this quarter is your best quarter in five years. Could you just give us your big picture thoughts on sustainability with JNJ\u2019s stock going through a difficult period going through RISPERDAL and Siplomax and some of the challenges ACTO 798 so it\u2019s been a long time coming. Can you just talk about your thoughts on NAPS or fact that this 5% level whether this is reasonable or sustainable range for the company? Thanks","Dominic Caruso","Right. Good morning, Mike. Well you\u2019re right we have been through some tough times which of course some of those are expected because of patent expirations and the like, but nonetheless, I think the focus that we had during those times to continue to invest particularly in our pharmaceutical pipeline has paid off for us. So if you look at the three businesses in particular, pharma of course is now as Joaquin said ten quarters of growth and accelerating that growth, and we\u2019re excited about the way the products are performing in the marketplace. And as Paul mentioned, we have new products coming that we\u2019re also very excited about.","MD&D of course is challenged by the lower procedure volumes that continue, but offsetting that of course, we now have Synthes as a member of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. And having a large presence in orthopedics, which we think will be in fact a growth area within Medical Devices given demographics and emerging market trends. So that should help us continue growth in that business along with new product innovation throughout all of MD&D. And the Consumer business is holding up well, you know, in a tough consumer environment generally.","But of course we\u2019re looking forward to the return of the OTC products, and we know that we\u2019re delayed in that return. We want to do this right. But of course we see those returning over the near term horizon in 2013. And so all in all I think the business is on sound footing, Mike. I think the investments we made were the appropriate ones. They\u2019re paying off. And the execution of the talented people of Johnson & Johnson is paying off. So I feel pretty good about where the business is right now, and obviously I can\u2019t give you a forecast or guidance for next year. We\u2019ll talk to you about that in January. But overall I feel pretty good that we\u2019re on solid footing here.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Let me switch to pharma. Paul, can you just cover two items for me? One is The Street\u2019s been a bit cautious on canagliflozin and given the challenges in diabetes and getting products, not only through the FDA, but having successful commercial launches post-approval. Can you just talk about your confidence in the safety profile and the degree to which you\u2019ve had discussions with the FDA on that? And then second, can you talk about in Hep C your strategy for an all oral regimen and where you think you take 435 from here? Thanks.","Paul Stoffels","Okay. Thank you. The first, we\u2019re pretty constant in canagliflozin and first the basics. If you look at the cancer, there was no evidence of any clinical meaningful imbalance in the incidence of cancer including breast and bladder in clinical trials with canagliflozin. I think we are pretty confident from that side that we have a safe compound. The urinary tract infections, if you look at our studies then, there was also in the pooled analysis is the incidence of UDI was a placebo for 100 milligrams 5.9, for 300 milligram 4.3. No real dose-related increase, and it\u2019s known for this type of compound. And typically these products are all managed with OTC medication.","So from a long-term safety perspective, we, as you know, we are doing the CANVAS study with a first part of the data which went to the FDA. We\u2019ll have a second interim analyst in 2013, and then later on, when the study is finished, it\u2019s an event driven trial, so we\u2019ll see when the study will be finished. But we are pretty confident that in those data, the support is there for a filing and an approval. The data show \u2013 we think the data shows solid cardiovascular safety in the balance between the LDL increase if you look at the overall ratios LDL, HDL, sorry, they were absolutely okay. If you look at the combine that with the blood pressure decrease, the reduction in triglycerides, the weight loss, and the improved glycemic control, we think that the balance between efficacy and safety is very solid for canagliflozin.","On 435, with 435 we have a best-in-class protease inhibitor, which we are \u2013 which we\u2019ll submit in the first half of next year. Drugs are developed one by one, so the first indication will be in the combination with interferon and ribavirin. We are doing additional early studies on testing the combination with 7977 from Gilead as well as with NS5a from BMS. And in addition to that, we have our internal drugs, which we are developing for our combination. I think as you \u2013 I think it\u2019s now absolutely clear that it\u2019s going to go to interferon-free regimens. The task will be combining safe and effective drugs together to make sure that we have the efficacy and the safety.","And as I said, drugs will be developed one by one. You have to show the efficacy and the safety of each of the drugs. And we\u2019ll participate significantly in that field.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse. I think your line is open.","Louise Mehrotra","Catherine?","Catherine Arnold \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hello, can you hear me?","Louise Mehrotra","Yes, we can. Hi, Catherine.","Catherine Arnold \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Hi. Good morning. First question\u2019s for Dominic. I was wondering if you could clarify the relative intensity you might be considering as far as looking for franchises that maybe the company should exit that are weighing on businesses. Obviously I know that you have been very clear that you\u2019re not planning on doing any significant restructuring and spin off type plan; however, as you exited stents and there may be other opportunities where your growth profile could further increase by you exiting certain businesses. I guess I\u2019m wondering to what extent that is a conversation at the board table.","And then a question for Paul. I just wondered, Paul, if you could give your commentary on the arthritis market and what you see as being most impactful, whether it\u2019s oral agents entering the marketplace. You\u2019ve obviously committed to that yourself and or bio similar entries into the marketplace. Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Thanks for the question, Catherine. Well, as far as exiting certain businesses, we consistently discuss portfolio choices. So our executive team along with all of our business leaders are consistently reviewing each of the businesses and trying to determine the ones that are performing well versus the competition, those that require more investment, those that require some more investment but we might not see the return, like in the case of drug-eluting stents.","So we\u2019re constantly reviewing that. We periodically have divestitures as you know in our results, and we typically use those gains as quite frankly a switch in portfolio emphasis by then reinvesting, you know, those gains in other parts of the business. So we continuously do that. And I think we\u2019ll continue to do that. I think we can do some more pruning of the businesses as we look to the future and determine where to best place our bets. So suffice it to say, it\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s always ongoing and top of mind, and I think we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward.","And, Paul?","Paul Stoffels","Yeah, let me address your question on first of all with SIMPONI, Celerra, and REMICADE. I think we have a leading franchise, and we are continuing to work with antibodies on new mechanism of actions here with ALV-3, L-6 we have additional new products coming there. At the same time, we are having a significant research activity internally on getting oral immunological agents. And while we didn\u2019t have an advanced JAK, that\u2019s why we made the deal on getting also a JAK inhibitor in our pipeline.","It\u2019s a selective JAK 3, and we think it has the potential to in preclinical showing safety and selectivity, so have a significant differentiation with the existing product. It\u2019s also a once-a -day product which we think compares favorably with the Pfizer compound twice a day, and this field is still to play out about selectivity, and we have to learn about the longer term safety and efficacy of these products. So we continue to bet on the two ways: It\u2019s the antibody space for new targets as well as the oral active agents. And Joaquin, if you can answer on the biosimilars.","Dominic Caruso","Biosimilars, Catherine, we described before our exclusivity situation in the U.S. and Europe in the U.S. in 2018 and in Europe with our pediatric extension is accepted would be until February 2015. So those are our core markets with REMICADE. Certainly we continue to work to shape our policy around guidelines and product development and approval of biosimilars, particular around the interchangeability and extrapolation of indications. So it\u2019s an area which we are working hard in order to try to protect patient safety as far as using biosimilars.","For us it\u2019s also very meaningful in this context, the fact that we file SIMPONI IV in rheumatoid arthritis and we file it in September, and we believe that SIMPONI IV, it\u2019s going to be a very good option for patients. It has a 30-minute infusion time which compares favorably with REMICADE. It has a low rate of infusion reactions, and it has a patent life until 2024. So we are confident that SIMPONI IV it\u2019s going to become an important option for patients, and it\u2019s going to make SIMPONI the only anti-T and F, which is going to be available at this point in subcutaneous and intravenous formulation.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.","Dominic Caruso","Morning, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Morning, Louise and everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The 14.6% U.S. pharma growth was obviously very strong. Dominic, could you parse out some of the timing related items and give us what you think the underlying growth was there of the U.S. pharma business in the quarter?","Dominic Caruso","Yeah, hi, Larry. I think there was some. As Louise mentioned earlier in her script, there was some inventory build in the quarter, not overall significant to the entire growth in the quarter. So we\u2019re pleased with the quarterly results, and I would say although somewhat impacted by these pipeline builds, I wouldn\u2019t consider them significant as a significant impact at all.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","And then one more for you, Dominic. Just the healthcare utilization trends in the U.S. and Europe for the med tech markets, maybe if you could, you know, give us just an update on what you saw. I know the data you typically use is based on the second quarter, but how do you \u2013 what was your sense of how things trended in the third quarter? You\u2019ve said that future growth is a good proxy for procedure growth. What did you see there? And what are you hearing from the field? Just any color you can give us on procedure trends. Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Larry. So let me deal with the U.S. first. So the statistics we have again are one quarter back so I don\u2019t want to project for the third quarter until we actually see the data. So with respect to second quarter, we saw overall utilization trends continuing to increase in both hospital admissions, hospital surgeries, physician office visits. They were all single digit increases, however. I don\u2019t want to overstate the increase.","We did see orthopedic procedures grow at around the mid single digit range, and that of course did translate into third quarter results for us as you saw with our orthopedics business and the joint reconstruction results. So that seems to be stabilizing because we\u2019ve now seen a couple quarters of these low rates of growth, and of course they\u2019re not exciting low rates of growth but they\u2019re not declines which is what we saw for the previous nine quarters, and more growth in orthopedic procedures in particular.","In Europe, we do see in the MD&D businesses some volume pressures particularly in Greece, Spain, Portugal, and early signs also in Italy. And just to give you a sense, the Europe business for Johnson & Johnson we reported 7% operational growth excluding Synthes that\u2019s about 2% operational growth, and within the MD&D business, excluding Synthes, it was marginally declined in the quarter but only slightly. So we are seeing some pressure as we expected to see early in the year in procedure volumes in Europe as well.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you very much.","Dominic Caruso","You\u2019re welcome","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS","Hello?","Dominic Caruso","Hello.","Joaquin Duato","Hi, Rajeev.","Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS","Hello. My question was on canagliflozin also and following up on the response to a previous question, I was wondering if you can talk about cardiovascular safety and a little bit more detail given the LDL signal. It seems possible the FDA could look fairly closely at the interim look from the canvass trial or perhaps a composite of the CV data across the Phase III. Maybe you could talk about that and whether that data might actually show a cardiovascular benefit. And if not, just from a regulatory perspective, would it make sense to approve a drug at this time without showing that cardiovascular benefit? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Well, it\u2019s difficult for me to judge on what the regulators will do. But based on the information and what we have submitted, I think all the information is in favor of a good safety profile and a balanced cardiovascular risk. The benefits we think significantly balance the cardiovascular risk, and therefore I think we\u2019ll have to see. We anticipate we\u2019ll have an advisory panel before the approval so more debate will happen there and I think our people are very well prepared to address this question. And so I think it\u2019s not appropriate for me to further go into this at this point.","Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS","Okay. I did have a couple of other form of follow-ups if I could. One on SIMPONI IV, I was wondering if you would comment on whether there might be any proactive switch strategy with REMICADE that the company could take on and also with respect to ZYTIGA and the rollout of chemo naive, I think you gave a sense for what the market opportunity may be there relative to chemo experience, maybe to talk a little bit about what the existing use of ZYTIGA is in chemo naive patients, and maybe some of the constraints that will get lifted from a payer perspective once you have formal approval. Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks for the question. Regarding the ZYTIGA, as I said, we are waiting to see the FDA response in December. Certainly we are very hopeful about that indication. It\u2019s going to significantly expand the patient population that is eligible for ZYTIGA treatment. And today our estimates of use in the chemoknife population are about 30% in the U.S., very low, very low in Europe. We are very pleased with the progress that ZYTIGA is having on the market.","We are seeing very strong demand trends through September, and we continue to hear about the positive impact that it\u2019s having in patients and the positive attitudes that physicians are having about ZYTIGA. So we are very confident that if granted, the approval in the pre-chemo population is going to further enhance the progression of ZYTIGA. Which, as I have said before, it\u2019s been the most successful oral oncology launch ever. The other question, can you repeat it, Rajeev, the first one that you were asking?","Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS","Oh, it\u2019s with respect to SIMPONI and the IV formulation and whether there might be a strategy to switch patients from REMICADE I guess both in sort of on a global basis.","Joaquin Duato","Thanks. It\u2019s a very good question. It\u2019s certainly for us to tell you what is going to be the strategy with SIMPONI, particularly with regards to REMICADE. REMICADE, it\u2019s a great option for patients. Physicians are very satisfied with the use of REMICADE. Today REMICADE, as I mentioned, has about 75% of the U.S. infusible market, so that reflects how satisfied physicians are with REMICADE. At the same time, we do believe that SIMPONI IV, it\u2019s going to offer some advantages, like the reduced infusion time. And when you are looking at the clinical data, it\u2019s going be a very strong clinical data package that we\u2019re going to be able to present. So we are confident that we\u2019re going to have a great option there. Now, how they are going to be positioned vis-\u00e0-vis each other, it\u2019s certainly for us to speculate. We are pleased that we\u2019re going to have two options, that\u2019s what I can tell you.","Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Ruben, Goldman Sachs.","Louise Mehrotra","Hi, Jamie.","Jamie Ruben \u2013 Goldman Sachs","To follow up on an earlier question regarding the company reshaping its portfolio. I think I heard you say you would consider pruning businesses, and would that include pruning entire divisions such as pharma or consumer? And then just a follow-up question on the pharma side. With INCIVO, I think, Louise, I heard you say that INCIVO represented about half the growth of I think the operational growth of infectious \u2013 of the infectious category. If you can just confirm that. And also, what types of patients are coming into treatment, and are you seeing warehousing of patients in Europe?","And just as a bigger sort of strategy follow-up, just to follow-up on what you\u2019re doing to leverage TMZ 435. Clearly, you have partnerships in place with Gilead and Bristol-Myers, but you don\u2019t own the other regimens, and your competitors, Gilead, Abbott and Bristol, own the all-oral regimens. I\u2019m just wondering if you can pontificate a bit on whether it\u2019s important. Do you think, can you achieve success in Hep C through partnerships or do you feel you have to own all the regimens? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Hi, Jamie. Let me take the first question about the portfolio and then turn it over of course to Paul on the Hep C question and other questions in the pharma business. When I referred to pruning our portfolio for businesses that might not fit or require more investment than we think would justify based on the return, I don\u2019t view shifting out of pharma MD&D or consumer as pruning. That would be a pretty major decision. And I could tell you we\u2019re not considering that now, and we feel very good about having a broad-based business in healthcare.","We think that\u2019s the way to be best positioned for where healthcare is going globally, and we believe having a broad portfolio is in fact the strongest set of cards we can have. So I would say the pruning refers to businesses that are not contributing to growth or for which investments are not worthy. And we always do that. We have done it over our history, and I would think we would continue to do it in the future as well. But not a wholesale reshaping of Johnson & Johnson. That\u2019s not under consideration now. Paul? Or Joaquin.","Paul Stoffels","I was going to address the question, Jamie, about the patients that are coming to therapy in Europe. So the patients that are coming to therapy come from two sources: One, patients that have advanced liver disease, and the other one, patients that have failed previous therapies. So that contributed to have an initial bolus of patients that was conducive to the strong start that we had in INCIVO in Europe. Are we seeing warehousing? Not at this point. I mean, at this point what we are seeing is what I would call a reduced urgency to treat based on the fact that this initial bonus of patients has already been treated. But we are not seeing warehousing at this point.","As I described in my presentation, we had some seasonality patterns, and now we are starting to see a pickup in September and in October that we think is going to continue","Dominic Caruso","With regard to 435, I don\u2019t have the holy grail answer, but on every drug you develop one by one, every drug needs preclinical safety and preclinical safety needs safety and efficacy. And if you combine three drugs, you need to have a massive amount of information and also luck to make sure the three drugs are both all safe and effective. And I think at this moment drugs are developed one by one, showing efficacy and safety, getting approved by the FDA. We\u2019ll see a change probably in having combinations approved. But I think we have a very solid foundation with a very well tolerated PI, best in class PI, once a day combinable with other drugs. There is very limited limitation. It\u2019s a low dose. And we have shown very strong efficacy data in Phase II and now Phase III of all enrolled.","So I think we are in a strong position to partner. We have our own internal compounds which we are doing combination studies with that also. We look for combinations with external partners. And the future will tell.","Joaquin Duato","And just to confirm, I said it\u2019s half the infectious disease worldwide operational growth that contributed. Okay? Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start out with a question on Consumer and then I\u2019ll turn to pharma. On Consumer, I think I heard you mention that you\u2019ve begun re-launching a number of products in OTC and that contributed to growth as well as some acquisition. And I was wondering if you could separate out the two for this quarter. But then just more broadly speaking, if you could also give us a sense for where you are in that re-launch of your OTC resupply. Are you a quarter of the way there? Halfway there? Kind of give us a sense for the progress.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Derrick. Thanks for the question. So Louise talked about the fact that we re-launched some products this quarter, and we acquired the rights for some Digestive Health products. So generally speaking, the growth is attributed about half to each. Okay? So about half of the growth came from the re-launch of some products, and half from the year-over-year comparison because of the new products we acquired in the Digestive Health space.","As far as our progress, we continue to make progress with the consent decree requirements. We have actually met all of the milestones that we\u2019re required to meet at the end of each quarter so far. We look forward to discussing with the FDA our progress in the near future. And we still are moving forward with completing all the remediation efforts. And as I said in previous discussions, it\u2019s just difficult to predict the speed and ramp at which the products can leave the plant until we complete the steps required and get the review and approvals required under the consent decrees. But overall we\u2019re making good progress and I\u2019m pleased to say that some products have come back to the market already and more are planned in the month ahead and obviously throughout 2013.","Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thank you. And then for Joaquin and Paul, a number of your recently launched products are going to be facing some significant competition quite shortly, the ones that come to mind are ZYTIGA facing competition from innovation, you\u2019ve got Tovacivativ the oral RA agent launching and potentially competing with your Immunology franchise and then while XARELTO looks to have picked up, it\u2019s going to be facing competition from Eloqueez shortly. So I was wondering if you can kind of go through each of those products and talk about how you expect the competitive threat to impact your business and how you plan to respond to those competitive threats?","Joaquin Duato","Thanks for the question. Let me start with ZYTIGA. So ZYTIGA as I said before, it\u2019s been the most successful global oral oncology launch ever. It\u2019s really transformed the post-chemo patients. When ZYTIGA was launched, 40% of the post-chemo patients were treated, now 75% of the post-chemo patients are treated. That\u2019s the reflection of the positive benefit that it has for the patients and the very positive efficient experience so far. All our service indicate very high satisfaction with Zytiga by physicians and patients. As I said before, we have had a strong demand trends through October, and certainly we have seen the launch of Extendi there it\u2019s very early on. Some of you have shown some data, IMS prescription data for the first four weeks, and it\u2019s still very preliminary.","What that data shows is that it is 10% below launch align Zytiga. Our service indicate that most of the use of Extendi it\u2019s been used in patients that have progressed from Zytiga. So I think that that makes sense. And at the end of the day, it\u2019s good for patients to have more options in these circumstances. We feel very confident of the trajectory that Zytiga is having. We also feel very good about the coverage and patients programs that Zytiga has. And I think that\u2019s going to even play out more with the price that Ensaluata might have which is 28% higher than Zytiga. We are very much looking forward to the approval on the pre-chemo population that would significantly expand the eligible patient pool. So we feel good about how Zytiga is tracking and certainly looking forward to that approval.","Moving to Xarelto, Xarelto has the broadest indication profile of the new oral anticoagulants, and it\u2019s the fastest growing new oral anticoagulant. As I commented, it has overtaken Pradaxa in new to brand sales in patients in all novel new to brand patients in atrial fibrillation. It has also overtaken Pradaxa in new to brand share in cardiology, and it\u2019s approaching Warfarin in that context. As a matter of fact, our attitudes and usage survey of September shows that Xarelto is the preferred brand by cardiologists ahead of Pradaxa and Warfarin. In other categories like in orthopods, it has garnered very strong acceptance, so we feel again very confident on the trajectory of Xarelto. Obviously we are awaiting two important decisions from the FDA.","One is in deep vein thrombosis in pulmonary embolism but we are looking forward to the decision in November. And then in March in ACS. So with all that and supported by the strong access that Xarelto has, as I mentioned, 90% both in commercial and in life, 70% of that is preferred. We think that we are going to have a very good 2013 and on and that we are confident that Xarelto is going to perform good in the face of the competition. Again, I think it\u2019s important that it\u2019s going to be the one with the broadest indication profile.","Orals, I think we discussed it before. Look, we need to see how the label for the orals play out on one side, and also we need to see how the risk benefit profile of the orals also comes to fruition when it\u2019s used in the practice. It\u2019s an interesting market. We recognize that, and as a matter of fact, we have done the deal as we described before. We believe that at this point, the anti nifs will remain the standard of therapy.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next yes comes from Danielle Telsey with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Telsey \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thank so much for taking the question. Quick question, Dominic, for you on capital allocation. Can you just give me a sense of what your strategy is going forward? Obviously on the dividend, one of \u2013 another large cap med tech company increased their dividend by about 30%, the stock reacted very favorably. Just curious as to whether that could be in the cards for J&J going forward and how you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation. Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Yeah, sure, Danielle. Thanks for the question. Well as we have said before, the \u2013 our priority on capital allocation are first, you know, generate significant cash flows, which we do. And then use those cash flows appropriately, and we generally view the use of the cash flow to towards the dividend as the first priority.","And with respect to that, I know others in med tech have increased their dividend significantly, but you probably know that med tech companies generally have been low dividend payers and pharma and consumer companies have been higher dividend payers. So just to give you some perspective on that, our blended competitive set, so if you took a company that had the same kinds of businesses as J&J has based on revenues, the competitive set blended dividend payout ratio is around 34%, and for Johnson & Johnson, our dividend payout ratio is 45%.","So we\u2019re already at a healthy dividend payout ratio compared to our competitive set. We then want to use the remaining cash that we generate to build our businesses, and we will look for value-creating opportunities to do that. Synthes is a good example of that. And then of course, as we\u2019ve done in the past, we would then allocate any remaining capital back to shareholders in the form of share repurchases as we\u2019ve done in the past, but we do view that as the third priority. So that\u2019s the way we think about it, and I think the reference to the med tech sector is a good one, but of course our business competes in three sectors. So I think \u2013 just make sure you take a look at that when you compare our dividend payout ratio to those of others that we compete with.","Danielle Telsey \u2013 Leerink Swann","Okay. Great. That\u2019s totally fair. And then on operating leverage going forward, you came in \u2013 you showed a little bit more operating leverage on the SG&A side than we were looking for this quarter. Just curious how much of that might be attributable to more Synthes synergies than maybe folks have been looking for. Any way to quantify that impact? Thanks so much, guys","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, Danielle, I don\u2019t think that this particular quarter there\u2019s much impact of Synthes synergies. We just began the integration process. We\u2019re going to do that over some period of time. Our priority will be first, you know, no disruption to our customers, and then of course, as we move forward with the integration, we will take appropriate actions to create the synergies that are available to us. But in this quarter, no contribution really from that particular acquisition. I think just good cost management, and as I said in my comments, operating \u2013 pre-tax operating margins can vary from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on stages of development in the R&D cycle, launches of products, milestone payments in R&D collaborations, etcetera. So we\u2019ll certainly give you a good indication of what you can expect for 2013 when we meet then.","Danielle Telsey \u2013 Leerink Swann","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Louise Mehrotra","With respect to everybody\u2019s time, we\u2019ll take two more questions. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glen Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","First question is on orthopedics. Louise, I think you mentioned that orthopedic pricing was down. I wonder if you can clarify those comments and tell us what knee and hip pricing was down on both U.S. and worldwide basis. And then sticking on knees and hips, one of the smaller players reported last week and kind of talked about excessive or more enhanced seasonality. I wonder if you saw that in the U.S. and Europe. Then I had one follow-up on spine.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. So in terms of worldwide price, we don\u2019t do price and mix on a worldwide basis, but worldwide price, the U.S. was down about 1%, international was flat, which left the worldwide down about 1%. In terms of the U.S., I can give you price and mix. So in the U.S., the hip price was down about 4%, which is very similar to what we saw in the second quarter. But we did see a nice positive tailwind from mix, which actually brought us to about, net-net, about 2.5% negative price mix in the U.S. In terms of knees in the U.S., it\u2019s down about 1% in price, but we did see a nice tailwind again in terms of mix, and net-net we\u2019re up about 1% price mix in the U.S., and that\u2019s similar.","Glen Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then just on spine, one of the smaller spine players reported earlier, pre-announced earlier, and highlighted more payer pushback. And so we\u2019ve been hearing about payer pushback for years. But I\u2019m wondering in the quarter if you saw enhanced or increased payer pushback. Thanks","Louise Mehrotra","We did not see that in our business, though the payers have been asking for evidence in the spine world for many, many years. And I think that that\u2019s just a continued trend.","Glen Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","And Glenn, this is Dominic, I think pricing in the U.S. for spine where you see that did not accelerate in the third quarter. It\u2019s been about the same as it was, negative mid-single-digit price in spine in the U.S., which is what we saw in previous quarters.","Glen Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So the takeaway is pricing is still down but stable, and payer pushback, no big change that we\u2019ve seen recently?","Dominic Caruso","No, I mean, you\u2019re continuing to get pushback on it, but that\u2019s a continuing trend. Okay?","Glen Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes with Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.","Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray","That\u2019s me, actually. Sorry. Can you hear me okay?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, we can.","Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray","I just want to be clear. That last comment was not me. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. One follow-up on pharma. I appreciate all the color on the call. I guess this is for Joaquin and Paul, I don\u2019t know, Dominic if you may want to weigh in on this. Just taking a step back, you made some great progress on the pharma pipeline as you talked about. Looking at the R&D investments as you continue to expand indications for many of your key franchises, how should we think about the leverage and margin trends there for your pharma business as you roll these things out? It is sort of an intermediate long-term question, but would love to get your sense and any color on how we should think about operating margin trends for that division maybe as they compare to historical trends. And then I have one follow-up.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Matt, good question. One thing I\u2019ll say about pharma R&D investment is it as you probably know at the higher end of the industry range for R&D investment. You know, obviously when I\u2019m talking about a medians or above the median. The more successful companies do invest more in R&D, and from my perspective as a CFO, if our internal development and the licensing strategy that the pharmaceutical team continues to do well with continues into the future, we\u2019re happy to be spending above-industry norms for R&D investment because that is, unlike many of our competitors, this is a very capital efficient way of developing the pharma business, right? Rather than a large capital infusion in the business.","We\u2019re talking about a continual level of R&D investment that has proven, as Paul has pointed out, to have a success rate that is above the industry norm. So I think that that should continue, and we\u2019ve been the beneficiaries of it so far, and I think as long as we continue to see that as worthwhile investment and a strategy that will continue into the future, we should continue to see it be above industry norms.","As far as the overall operating margins for the second sector, I\u2019m not going to comment on specific operating margins overall for one sector, because as you know, and we have talked about this many times, we manage the business of Johnson & Johnson holistically, and we make decisions across each business depending on the needs and the","opportunities of each business. So we\u2019ll provide more color commentary on the overall operating margins when we next meet in January.","Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Fair enough. And then just one follow-up on the device side. It would be helpful if you can expand as you get through the Synthes integration, maybe how your efforts there are trending relative to your expectations in terms of \u2013 in terms of maintaining the continuity of that business, your efforts to retain elements of that business both on the trauma and the spine side. And you mentioned in Europe one of the elements I think you threw into one of the businesses, there was a competitive dynamic in the quarter. If you could maybe highlight where that was and the nature of that pressure, that would be very helpful, as well.","Dominic Caruso","Louise, do you want to take that?","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. So the competitive dynamic in hips and knees were actually some lower-cost competition. So Dominic, did you want to -?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. On the Synthes integration, it\u2019s early. We closed the deal in mid-June, as I said, our first priority is no disruption to customers. But the updates that we\u2019re getting tell us that things are moving along just fine. We\u2019re integrating obviously the spine businesses, because they\u2019re the two businesses that we had that were similar. So that\u2019s where the bulk of the integration is occurring.","And so far so good. We\u2019re going to take this carefully. We\u2019re going to be measured in the way we do this so that there\u2019s very little disruption if any, and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s the right way to do it for the long term. The leaders are intact. We\u2019re very pleased to have the Synthes leadership team join Johnson & Johnson, and as you all know, Michelle Orzinger, the previous CEO of Synthes now leads our entire combined orthopedics business. And on November 1st, you\u2019ll get to hear more from Michelle and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll give you some more color commentary on the how the accretion is going but so far we\u2019re pleased","Louise Mehrotra","So some closing remarks from Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Thanks, Louise. And I also want to take a moment to thank Paul and Joaquin for joining us this morning and giving us an update on the exciting development in the pharmaceutical pipeline and in our pharmaceutical business. I look forward to speaking to you again on November 1st at our MD&D business review, and then again in January, early mid January when we review our fourth quarter and full-year results. So thank you for your time this morning and have a great day","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. And it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2016. Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer.","A few logistics before we get into the details; this review is being made available via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I will begin by briefly reviewing the first quarter for the corporation and for our three business segments. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.","A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.","Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, up 0.6% versus first quarter 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9%, and currency had a negative impact of 3.3%.","In the U.S., sales were up 7.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 6.6%. On an operational basis, Asia-Pacific and Africa grew 3%. Europe declined 0.8%, and the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. declined by 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted operational growth in the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S.","Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 6.9% worldwide, 9.8% in the U.S., and 3.8% outside the U.S. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted worldwide and outside-the-U.S. operational growth by 60 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.54 versus $1.53 a year ago. As a reference, in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $205 million and a charge of $192 million for after-tax special items. 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $98 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.","Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 6.1% and 7.7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 10.3%.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated, and therefore exclude the currency translation impact.","I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.2 billion decreased 0.2%, with U.S. sales down 0.1%, while outside-the-U.S. sales were down 0.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 1.9% worldwide, 4.1% in the U.S., and 0.5% outside the U.S. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 200 basis points and 320 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to women's health, oral care, and baby care.","Growth for the segment was driven primarily by OTC worldwide and oral care. OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak flu season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic share growth and an inventory build as well as seasonal and new product launch inventory for upper respiratory products.","In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 12% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 46%, up from nearly 43% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of analgesics and anti-smoking aids, partially offset by lower sales of upper respiratory products due to the fourth quarter distributor inventory build, as noted last quarter. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in oral care.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 8.5%, with U.S. sales up 12.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.6%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products.","Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide in the U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.3%, 16.2%, and 7.1%, respectively.","As we discussed last year, U.S. results in the first quarter of 2015 included a positive adjustment for gross-to-net, including managed Medicaid rebates. In the first quarter this year, U.S. results included an adjustment for a similar amount, and therefore overall growth was not impacted. However, on a product basis, STELARA growth in 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 16 points, XARELTO by four points, and REMICADE by three points.","Significant contributors to growth were immunology products REMICADE, STELARA, and SIMPONI\/SIMPONI ARIA, oncology products IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX, as well as cardiovascular metabolic products XARELTO and INVOKANA. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth as well as the gross-to-net adjustment to sales that I mentioned.","Combined REMICADE export sales and international sales grew approximately 11%. Sales to distribution partners were up approximately 5%. Sales to our international direct markets were up approximately 17% due primarily to strong double-digit growth in the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S., primarily driven by timing of shipments and market growth.","Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals, and demonstrated efficacy drove the results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 65 countries.","DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake. DARZALEX contributed over 2% to the U.S. Pharmaceutical growth rate.","XARELTO sales were up 29%, and total prescription share, or TRx, for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 16.5%, up over 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was nearly 14% and in cardiology nearly 23.5%, up on a sequential basis by 0.5 point and 0.3 points, respectively. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed, with 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product.","INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 18% on a worldwide basis and nearly 12% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin was 6.1%, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was 11.5% and 5.5% in the primary care. On a sequential basis, sales declined due to the extra shipping days in the fourth quarter, incremental rebates and savings program redemptions, as well as increased competition and formulary positions. INVOKANA access remains strong at 80% preferred for combined commercial and Part D.","I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.5%. U.S. sales increased 2.2% while sales outside the U.S. declined 1%. Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3% worldwide, with the U.S. up 3.3% and the growth of 2.8% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by orthopedics, advanced surgery, and electrophysiology.","Orthopedic sales growth was driven by worldwide knees and hips and U.S. trauma and spine. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. orthopedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platform in hips, and ORTHOVISC\/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to results.","Orthopedic sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by results in China due to a softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine other were the categories most impacted. In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products, with endocutters growth of 10%, biosurgicals growth of 8%, and energy growth of 8%. Base electrophysiology grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2016. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Louise, and good morning, everyone.","We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We are very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter, and we continue to make very good progress on our nearer-term priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed during our January call. We remain confident in the strength of our business.","As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, as well as hepatitis C sales, and a few extra shipping days in 2015, was 5.5%. On this same basis, we gained momentum in the first quarter, with strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7% and in line with analyst estimates.","In our Pharmaceutical business, our strong performance from 2015 continued into the first quarter, with underlying operational growth at over 12%. First quarter underlying operational sales growth for Consumer increased approximately 4% when also adjusting for the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela that Louise mentioned earlier.","In Medical Devices, we're off to a good start in the first quarter, with underlying operational growth of approximately 3%. Growth in our consumer-facing Medical Device businesses was negatively impacted by challenges in the diabetes market. For the hospital-focused Medical Device businesses, we're seeing signs of continued improvement, with underlying operational growth in those businesses of approximately 4%, driven by strength in our orthopedics, advanced surgery, and electrophysiology businesses.","We also saw an improvement in our overall adjusted pre-tax operating margin. For 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase on an adjusted basis, and we remain comfortable with that forecast, as we will accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, pre-tax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative, and R&D expenses.","Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key developments from the first quarter as well as some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016.","During the quarter, we had several key developments across the business. In our Pharmaceutical business, we received an additional approval for IMBRUVICA for first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and also entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with TESARO for exclusive rights to the investigational compound niraparib in prostate cancer. Niraparib is an orally administered poly polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor.","We also continued our efforts to combat major global health challenges through collaborations with government organizations and others in the industry, with a call for innovative ideas to reduce HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa as well as providing funding for nonprofit organizations supporting underserved communities in the United States.","In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlled substance raw material and API business. In 2015, these businesses totaled approximately $250 million in net trade sales. This divestiture remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but is expected to be completed towards the middle of 2016.","In Medical Devices, Ethicon completed the acquisition of NeuWave Medical, a privately held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems. We look forward to providing an in-depth review of the ongoing efforts of our Consumer and Medical Device businesses at our upcoming business review meeting on May 18, which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey.","I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 3.9%. And excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep-C sales, it was a strong 6.9%. If you will direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following, intangible asset amortization of $200 million and litigation charges and our Medical Devices restructuring charge.","Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68 per share, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 7.7% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.72, up 10% over the prior year.","Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 10 basis points, mostly due to transactional currency, partially offset by a favorable mix in the business. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales, or 110 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to continued good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.5%, higher than the prior year, due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines.","Our pre-tax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.9%, 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of the prior year. Interest expense net of interest income was lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments.","Other income and expense was a net gain of $39 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $348 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $127 million compared to a net gain of $91 million in the prior-year period.","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, and the current mix of our business.","Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. On our 2015 year-end call, we commented on our segment results for adjusted income before tax versus the prior year. Now that all of our competitors have reported their results for 2015, I would like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2015 adjusted income before tax was 31.4% compared to 26.2% weighted average for our competitive set. This was driven by higher margins in both Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and somewhat lower margins in our Consumer business as compared to our competitive set.","In the first quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by improvement in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. Our Consumer business had a lower margin this year as compared to last year, due principally to devaluation in Venezuela. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full-year 2016 as compared to 2015.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $23 billion of debt.","As you know, in February we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates with a debt issuance of $7.5 billion. Through the end of the first quarter, we completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete 75% of the program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales, and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and this is also unchanged versus our January guidance.","And now a word on taxes, our guidance for 2016 includes the R&D tax credit that Congress made permanent in 2015. We are therefore comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%, lower by 50 basis points than our previous guidance due to updating our outlook for a higher mix of our earnings from lower tax jurisdictions in 2016 than we anticipated in our previous guidance.","And now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrant for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. And our assumption with regard to REMICADE biosimilar remains unchanged, even with the recent FDA approval of INFLECTRA, due to our intellectual property, which we intend to defend. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year from ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO.","As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a very good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","Consistent with our previous guidance, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales would be approximately 5.5%, a level of growth comparable to last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier.","The devaluation in Venezuela that we previously discussed is anticipated to be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points for the full year, which we anticipate will be offset by the strength of the business.","Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.13, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1%. This is an improvement of 50 basis points since we last provided guidance. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely, as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect a change in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%, for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion, higher than our previous guidance.","Now turning to earnings, as a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.56 to $6.71 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 6% to 8%. This is higher than our previous guidance.","If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, a better outlook than the approximate $0.10 negative impact we discussed in our January guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.53 to $6.68 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due to an update to our tax rate and current currency estimates. As it's still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.","In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year. Namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and underlying operational sales growth of 5.5%, consistent with 2015 growth on a comparable basis.","Our operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operational adjusted EPS growth in our guidance remains strong, in the range of 6% to 8%, and our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations. In particular, we're pleased to see our Medical Device businesses showing continued signs of improvement, and our restructuring activities in that business are on track. And we look forward to discussing with you in more detail these activities on our May 18 Investor Day.","Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Dominic. And, Manny, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. With that, our first question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, David.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. I'm going to start with a strategic question for Dominic, and then one follow-up. Dominic, the longstanding view of J&J has been to assert the defensiveness of having these three major franchises under the J&J family of companies. Does that still remain the prevailing view of management and the board? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, David, it's our view, both management and the board, that our broadly-based business is the right approach to have in healthcare. It certainly has served us well and we expect it will continue to serve us well as the healthcare industry evolves in the future. We think of ourselves as a healthcare company, and of course that allows us to access opportunities in healthcare no matter where they be, either in Pharma, Medical Devices, or in Consumer Health.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. And then the second question, either for Louise or Dominic, just REMICADE gross-to-net dynamics in the quarter, any more detail you can provide us on that or any sense of what you're expecting net pricing gains to be for REMICADE in the U.S. for 2016? Thanks so much.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. So as we've discussed, we had the prior year gross-to-net that you saw that contributed I think it was 3% to the REMICADE growth, and pricing dynamics continued to be okay in that market.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I don't think it's expected that REMICADE sales will be significantly impacted year over year by gross-to-net adjustments.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, next question, please.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I know you've had some public comments, Dominic, recently around the REMICADE franchise. But now that we have the I-compound (30:23) panel and the FDA approval in the rearview window, clearly you don't expect any biosimilar competition in 2016 due to your defense of IP, but any updated thoughts on the potential impact of biosimilar competition to the REMICADE franchise in 2017 and beyond?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You're right, Josh, we don't expect biosimilar competition in 2016. As you know, we have several patents that we intend to defend. For example, the U.S. patent, the '471 patent [U.S. Patent number 6,284,471], extends to 2018, and another patent that we have extends to 2027.","Having said that, I think overall the immunology franchise of Johnson & Johnson is very strong because it's not just about REMICADE. Of course, we have STELARA, SIMPONI, et cetera. And the overall pipeline in the Pharmaceutical business, as you know from our review last May, is very, very robust, with 10 new products being filed, each of which having more than $1 billion potential. So overall we remain very, very comfortable with the growth outlook for the Pharmaceutical business regardless of the outcome of any REMICADE biosimilar.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. I just wanted to follow up with a question on your operating margin guidance maintaining at 200 basis points. I was just curious about the Venezuelan crisis impact. It looks like it primarily hit the Consumer units operating margins. But can you talk about the expectations of Venezuela's impact on your operating margins at the beginning of the year, how your internal expectations have evolved? Clearly with maintaining that guidance, the performance of the rest of the business units are going to offset any direct impact from Venezuela. But I just wanted to hear about any offsets there and the impact to the operating margin performance of the Consumer unit. And can Consumer still experience operating margin expansion in 2016? Thanks for taking the questions.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Josh. Just to put things in perspective, Venezuela is less than 1% of our sales, less than 0.5% of our sales, so it's not a very significant impact. It is more significant in Consumer than in the other businesses. But we're very confident in our outlook for a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin expansion \u2013 pre-tax operating margin expansion for 2016. And that will be across all the businesses, including Consumer, who will make a significant contribution to that, even despite the impacts of Venezuela. So we're very confident with that outlook for the year.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Mike.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. The immunology franchise, REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA, all had much better growth than at least the scripts would have suggested. Outside of the gross-to-net, was there an inventory catch-up this quarter that might have impacted those products?","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","So in the U.S., nothing significant in the inventory. That market grows strong, strong double digits, and that is a good contributor to the immunology. STELARA continues to grow market share. SIMPONI ARIA is contributing to the results; but in the U.S., no significant inventory build.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Can we talk about DARZALEX? DARZALEX obviously had a very, very strong first full quarter out of the box here. Can you just talk about the uptake in multiple myeloma and how you see it playing out on the back of the relapsed refractory data?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Mike, we're obviously very pleased with the early uptake of DARZALEX. And as we said, it contributed two points of growth to our U.S. Pharma business, so off to a great start. The CD38 mechanism of action seems to be something that the KOLs [Key Opinion Leaders] really respect as having a significant impact on the disease. And we think the product is going to do extremely well and will see continued uptake throughout the year.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","And also we had the CASTOR trial, which actually the IDMC [Independent Data Monitoring Committee] has recommended to stop early. So that's a very positive sign as well in that instance.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Dominic, one quick finance question for you. The tax rate coming down runs a little bit counter to the performance of the business because your growth in the U.S. has been so strong, particularly in the Pharmaceutical business. So what we see optically is very strong U.S. revenue growth and we assume U.S. profit growth. But obviously, the manufacturing IP of some of those products is outside the U.S. Can you just shed a little bit of light there on how you're managing that because the U.S. business relative to the OUS business looks very different?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Mike, it's an interesting observation. Actually, the strength of the sales in any one particular region does not necessarily correlate with the strength of the earnings in that region, and it's for the very reason that you mentioned, which is where the IP is located, where the manufacturing takes place, et cetera. So what we did is we just updated our outlook with how the profits will fall amongst the different regions and different jurisdictions. And we thought about 0.5 point improvement in the overall tax rate would be achievable this year for the full year, and therefore we adjusted that in our outlook.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you, Dominic.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Kristen.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Kristen.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the diabetes business. I think, Dominic, you had mentioned there are challenges in the market. I was just wondering if you could comment about INVOKANA and the additional competition that's in the market or just provide a little bit more commentary there.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Just to clarify what I said, I was talking about challenges in the market with respect to our consumer Medical Device diabetes business, the LifeScan business. And what I meant by that was we see continued pricing pressure in that market, and we also see some competition with respect to new pumps being launched. We've just launched a new pump obviously, so we're also seeing good uptake with our current pump. So the dynamics I'm talking about are in the Medical Device piece of the business as being challenging. Overall, INVOKANA continues to do well. Its uptake is strong quarter over quarter and remains a growth driver for us going forward.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then I guess just more broadly, what are you seeing \u2013 can you just go back and address China? I know that was something that you had brought up just in terms of still seeing a little bit of softness, I think you had mentioned more within the Medical Device segment. Any changes there, is it getting worse or getting any better?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. China again, just to put it in perspective, it's about 5% of our overall business. And a slowdown in the economy actually last year is what caused some distributor inventory to be at relatively high levels. That distributor inventory is beginning to bleed off. We saw that in the first quarter, and we think that that bleed-off will be completed shortly. So we don't expect to see a continued impact of that for the rest of the year.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, perfect. Thanks, everyone.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Jami.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning. I have a few questions. Just back to Kristen's question on diabetes, INVOKANA is an important growth driver for the company, but sales did come in a bit lighter than we had anticipated, despite I think the growing excitement about this class of drugs. Dominic, can you comment just generally on what drug categories you are seeing widening gross-to-net discounts? And are you seeing more gross-to-net discounts or widening discounts specifically in diabetes? And can you comment on where you might be seeing that elsewhere in the Pharma business?","My second question is on the OTC business. You've clearly highlighted the strong growth that you're seeing in the U.S. and particularly the analgesics market. How much of that growth is just regaining back lost market share from private label when you were out of the market, and how much of that is market growth? And maybe you can comment just generally on the dynamics of the OTC marketplace and where you see store brand market share now. Thanks, and I have one more follow-up, one more follow-up.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Wow.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, let's take them in order. And, Louise, you could add, obviously, if I've left anything out. I wouldn't say, Jami, that there's any one particular area in the business where we see a widening of gross-to-net or rebating that's any different than what we've seen before in the business. So rather than comment on any one particular area, I would say generally speaking there's nothing that sticks out to us as a widening trend.","With respect to U.S. OTC, a couple things to mention; we are gaining back share, and the products are doing very, very well. And this particular quarter was a relatively low growth market quarter because of a very, very soft flu season, a very, very soft flu season. So most of the growth that we saw is not on the back of market expansion but on the back of share expansion as we continue to regain share.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Are you where you want to be in terms of regaining back that lost share, and what is a realistic goal? You were out of the market completely. Where are you now?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","So we're not where we want to be. We're continuing \u2013 we're pleased. As Alex [Gorsky] often says, we're pleased but not satisfied. So we're going to continue to gain share there. And, Louise, do you have the year-over-year comparison of share?","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, so in 2009, before the McNeil issues that we had, the adult share was about 25%, and we're back to 14%. And pediatric was about 70%, and we're now back to 46%, so you're seeing some nice growth on that. And if you take a look at year over year, the adult (sic) [pediatric] (40:56) share a year ago was 43%, so you see it going up about three points. And then the pediatric share is also going up to the 46%.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","So we're making progress.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","I'm sorry, that was pediatric share, sorry, from 43% to 46%.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","We're making progress, Jami, but we're not finished. I think these products have a long heritage and legacy. They're very, very important in overall healthcare. And quite frankly, they're admired by consumers. So we expect to see continued share growth.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","And in the adult, it was 14% U.S. share now, and it was 12%. And you asked about the private label. We think in the U.S. market, the adult is about a third, and in the pediatric it's about 40%.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, and then just can I follow up, Dominic? I'm actually shocked that I'm what, the fifth, sixth question and this hasn't come up yet. Your net cash position is now $17 billion. That keeps growing. I don't think any company that I cover or anybody else covers has the kind of balance sheet prowess that you have, the lack of debt on your balance sheet. And I think what was it, back in September at an investor conference you had mentioned that you were uncomfortable with the amount of cash that you had growing on the balance sheet. And now here we are six to seven months later and don't really see any activity with respect to putting that cash to work with the exception of a buyback that you announced earlier this year.","Can you just give us an update on your thoughts on capital allocation? Clearly, we've had a lot of disruption in the marketplace, with valuations on many names coming back. And I'm just surprised that we haven't really seen much action on the part of capital allocation from J&J. Thanks, and then I'm done.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, sure, Jami. Okay, great. Okay, good, all right. Just to clarify, back in September, I didn't really say I was uncomfortable with the level of cash. I just said that it was a higher level of cash than we normally hold. And then of course, after that we announced a $10 billion share buyback. So we're very conscious of the fact that while we're evaluating M&A opportunities, we can continue to return capital to shareholders, which in addition to our very, very strong dividend, we can do share buybacks. We're in the middle of doing one right now, and we'll obviously evaluate whether we continue increase that particular share buyback as time goes on.","With respect to not allocating capital to any particular deals, I could tell you that we're very active, but as you know, we're also very disciplined. We do see opportunities, but we want to do the right deal at the right time with the right party at the right valuation. And we're comfortable waiting for that to take place because we think that's what ultimately generates the most value for shareholders.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is that what you plan to do with your cash, M&A, Dominic? Is that what the message is today?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","The message is very consistent, what it's always been. Our first priority is allocating capital to dividends. So we'll announce what we're going to do with dividends at our April 28 shareholder meeting. After that, we'd like to grow the business and create value for shareholders through M&A. And in addition to that, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders through share purchases, repurchase. So it's not really a change. So our attitude, our capital allocation policy does not change depending on how much capital we have. It's all about creating the most value for shareholders with whatever capital we deploy.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, good morning, just two questions. Let me first just piggyback on what Jami just asked because I think we're all surprised that J&J hasn't done more with the balance sheet so far. And I'm just wondering, Dominic, as you're having these discussions, it appears that some of the targets you may be having discussions with have unrealistic valuation expectations. So maybe talk about where valuation expectations have come. Are they getting at least in the ballpark of what J&J thinks is appropriate valuation?","And then with Allergan and Pfizer no longer getting together, you have two more companies that are going to be actively looking at deals. And does that make the competitive landscape more challenging for J&J? And then I had a follow-up on devices. Thank you.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Glenn. In certain areas of the market, valuations are still high. They're coming down, as you know, in biotech in particular. But in certain other areas, in med device, for example, certain valuations are still inflated, in our opinion. Things will get better as time goes on, we believe. We're patient, disciplined. And as I said earlier, we'll look for the right opportunity, but at the right time at the right valuation.","With respect to Allergan and Pfizer maybe being in the market now and creating more competition, that's probably true. I can't speak for what they're going to do, but we're accustomed to looking at various acquisition candidates where more than one party may be interested in a particular asset. That does not dissuade us from being disciplined and having a clear focus on ultimately what matters, which is the deployment of that capital to create shareholder value. So yes, there will be more competition. We'll still remain very disciplined.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, and then let me just follow up on the Device business. When you ex out divestitures and currency, the Device business grew 3% in the first quarter, and that's pretty much in line with most of the device categories that we cover. But I don't think J&J had any major new product launches here recently. So is the improvement in the Device business for J&J, is that just better execution and better blocking and tackling, or did some of the major end markets in cardio and ortho and spine in the first quarter come in slightly better than you expected? Thank you.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Just to clarify, 3% overall is the Medical Device business ex-acquisition and divestitures, but the hospital-based Medical Device business excluding the consumer-facing Medical Device businesses, that grew 4% on a comparable basis.","We did have a number of products that we filed last year, and we have about 30 new products that we're launching. Half of those have already been launched, so we are seeing the impact of those. And I think it's also a matter of focus, focus on the primary growth drivers. For example, you saw very good results in energy, in endocutters, in electrophysiology as major drivers of growth. And also we're very pleased with the results in orthopedics. And the ATTUNE Knee, for example, in the U.S. in particular, the U.S. growth was over 8% for knees, which is pretty fantastic growth, and the ATTUNE knee is still a new product that's being launched in that marketplace.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But as you talk to division heads, is everything \u2013 are the end markets status quo, no change, still stable, or is there any pickup in some of these end markets?","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think from what we've seen back in the fourth quarter trends, because we don't have all the first quarter trends, continued improvement in procedural growth, but not dramatic, Glenn, just a continued steady improvement in procedural growth. Anything else, Louise?","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","So our estimate of the first quarter hip market is about 3.5% in the U.S., again qualified, but we haven't seen all the competitors report. We think the U.S. knee market grew about 4.5%, and we believe we grew faster than those markets. Now we did have about 1.5 extra selling days. But even if you take that out of there, we do believe we grew faster than the market in hips and knees in the U.S.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Louise. Thank you, Dominic.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","You're welcome.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome, Glenn.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning Vamil.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions, so just a couple following up on some of the topics that have been raised already. The one we've specifically been getting a lot of questions are around your desire on the Consumer side to maybe do business development. I know you talked generally about M&A. Maybe if you could, just provide a little more color on the Consumer side specifically and if it is an area where you're looking to boost. Is there a preference you can share? I think in the past you've talked about emerging markets, but I was just wondering if there is anything more timely you can share today on that side of things.","And then the second question relates back to the INVOKANA discussion that we were having before. There was this announcement last week that the EMA [European Medicines Agency] is looking into an increase in amputations that is being seen in the CANVAS study. I'm curious if you have any comments on that at this point. And also, is that something that the FDA is also looking into at this point? Thanks.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Vamil. So on M&A, just in general we're looking at M&A as an important additional growth driver in all of our businesses, including Consumer. As we've said before, Consumer can generally benefit from taking very, very specific brands that are in certain regional categories. We're certainly in our sweet spot of skin care, baby, oral care, et cetera, where we think we could do better with a combination of the technology that we have and the overall market and distribution presence that we have. So we'll continue to look there. And again, like every other M&A evaluation, we'll make sure that it's at the right valuation at the right time.","With respect to INVOKANA, a couple things to mention there. There has been \u2013 previous to this CANVAS study, there have been 12 previous studies with INVOKANA where we saw no such indication of increase in lower limb amputations, particularly the toe, so this seems to be focused only on the patients in the CANVAS study. It's important to note that, yes, that European regulatory body is taking a look at it, but already the independent monitoring committee that reviews the clinical trial after reviewing all the data concluded that the trial should continue. So that's what I can tell you about that. And obviously, we'll look to advise physicians appropriately of the results once we have more understanding of them.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question, please.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, just a couple on the Pharma segment. You guys have a new product cycle obviously coming up with guselkumab and sirukumab. I guess when you think about this in the context of the pricing environment, especially with INFLECTRA down the road, how do you guys think about durability of pricing in the immunology segment? And I have one more follow-up on Pharma.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, sure, Geoff. Both guselkumab and sirukumab are different mechanisms of action than the current products that we have in immunology. And typically, innovative products that have a significant impact on unmet medical need \u2013 in this case it would be those patients that are not otherwise responding to, for example, TNF therapy, our view is that pricing will still continue to be \u2013 the products will still continue to be valued and therefore not have a lot of pressure on pricing because there is some still significant unmet medical need, and it's a new mechanism of action that should have an impact on patients.","I think that that's irrespective of whether or not there's a biosimilar in the market with respect to REMICADE because overall pricing for immunology products, particularly in the TNF category, already have pretty significant gross-to-net discounts in the marketplace. I think we've talked before about that ours are already in the 25% range, so I don't think there's that much room for there to be significantly lower pricing in that market.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. And just as a follow-up to the other questions on M&A, the TESARO agreement with the PARP, clearly there's a lot of excitement with this class. I guess the question is, was the focus on prostate strategic or is it data-driven? I just want to get your sense, Dominic, for maybe other indications that you could have some enthusiasm for, for PARP, such as ovarian or breast cancer, et cetera.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Our agreement with respect to this PARP inhibitor was a result of our oncology therapeutic area, taking a look at where PARPs can have an added benefit. Our first approach to this is going to be with prostate cancer in conjunction with our development of ARN-509 in prostate cancer, so the particular focus at the moment is in prostate cancer, Geoff.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you, thanks.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Damien Conover of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Damien.","Damien Conover - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, just a question on the nerve growth factor discontinuation. It looked like there was a prioritization within the pipeline to discontinue that. I just had a question what projects you might be accelerating also, given that those Phase 3 studies are coming up shortly. I just wanted to understand that a little bit more.","Also, with the hepatitis C products there, you have some very potent products. I wanted to see what the next steps were for bringing those to the market, the timeline. And then lastly, just on REMICADE, has J&J received a 180-day notice of a biosimilar launch from Pfizer? Thank you.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","All right, let me take them in the order you gave them, and Louise can help here as well. So with respect to \u2013 why don't you take the hepatitis C question?","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, so we're expecting to see some Phase 2 data of our AL-335 and the three direct-acting inhibitors in 2016.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Right, and also with respect to your question on the 180-day notice period, yes, we have received that from Celltrion.","And with respect to the growth nerve factor discontinuance, what you said was exactly right. This was a portfolio question. As we mentioned, we have 10 new products that we're planning to file between now and 2019. Obviously, we're going to focus on those. They all have more than $1 billion potential. So we make portfolio decisions all the time, and this is just another one of those types of decisions.","Damien Conover - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Great, thank you.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","You're welcome. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Miksic of UBS. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Matt.","Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. This is Vik in for Matt. I have two questions. Now that the CJR [Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement] bundle payment system is in effect for hips and knees, can you talk a little bit about your approach to customers and what you can expect to help there?","And the second question I have is an update on the payer environment in spine, any meaningful changes that you guys have seen in support amongst payers? Thank you.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Generally speaking, on the bundling approach, which is now present in certain markets but not across all markets in the U.S., we do think that we're positioned very well there because obviously we have a very broad portfolio of products. So the bundling approach with the hospital or integrated care network would include multiple Johnson & Johnson products, which we think we're in a great position to partner with in that regard.","The payer economics in spine, we haven't seen much of a dramatic change there. One thing I'd like to point out is we did see growth in our spine business this quarter of about 2%. So we're very pleased with that business coming back and showing some improvement.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","So we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Larry.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. I hope you can hear me okay. So, Dominic, on the call today, you guided organic sales growth in 2016 about the same as in 2015, which was 5.5% excluding the benefit from extra selling days. However, if we compare 2016 to 2015, organic growth on the same 52-week basis, we estimate that your 2016 organic growth should be closer to 6% to 6.5%. In other words, the 5.5% in 2016 doesn't adjust for the extra selling days in 2015. Is our math directionally right, Dominic? And I had one follow-up.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think you're directionally right. I think you're right that without the \u2013 if you just neutralized I guess is what you did, for the extra selling days, we would see growth of better than 5.5%, right.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, I just wanted to confirm that. And then lastly, Dominic, last week you announced that you discontinued UPP, or Unilateral Pricing Policy, in your VISTAKON business. Can you talk about the rationale there and what this signals regarding any change in your strategy and how you're running your contact lens business? If I recall, two years ago when you implemented UPP, it was disruptive to your U.S. VISTAKON business. So why should we not assume or be concerned that you might have similar types of disruptions from discontinuing UPP and moving to a different pricing model now? Thanks for taking the questions.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Larry. Thanks for the question, just a couple things on the Vision Care business and our ACUVUE brand. As you know, the ACUVUE business has a long heritage of strong category growth as well as good innovation, which creates fantastic products for contact lens wearers. And as you know, we are the world leader in contact lenses with the ACUVUE brand. And we just launched four new products in 2015, which are being received very well by the eye care professional and the contact lens wearer.","Back in 2014, we did not have that kind of innovation coming to market, first of all. And secondly, we saw some unevenness in the pricing in the market with very, very different pricing in different channels. So, we decided to implement the Unilateral Pricing Policy in order to even out the pricing. And at the end of the day, what happened there was we did see a lower overall price for our products, which made the products more affordable. So today the majority of the patients who get ACUVUE contact lenses are paying less than they did for that brand two years ago.","Now with innovation and with the market stabilizing, we've adopted a new program that encourages patients to see their eye care professional and provides rebates and incentives for the purchase of contact lenses in conjunction with their eye exam as prescribed by the eye care professional. And we think that's just the next evolution as a market leader to focus on eye health and not just price of the contact lens. So just a continued evolution of how we approach the market, and there may be \u2013 when there is some slight disruption in the market, we think that overall the long-term benefit to the overall category into our business is worth it.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and that concludes the Q&A. And we'll have some closing remarks from Dominic.","Dominic J. Caruso - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, thanks, Louise. As I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our continued momentum as we entered into 2016. I would just like to take this time to recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for your time this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013. ","Joining me on the podium today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details.","This review is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the fourth quarter and full year of 2013 for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. ","Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2013 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Dominic will then provide some additional commentary on financial results and guidance for 2014. We will then open the meeting to your questions. We expect the meeting to conclude at approximately 10:15.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Also, please note that the presentation of today\u2019s remarks is available on our website. ","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations\u2019 section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","A number of the compounds and products discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.","Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let\u2019s begin with the schedule titled \u201cSupplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area.\u201d","Worldwide sales to customers were $18.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, up 4.5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. On an operational basis, sales were up 6.3% and currency had a negative impact of 1.8%.","In the U.S., sales were up 7.4% and in regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 5.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 3.2%. ","The Asia Pacific\/Africa region grew 7% operationally. Both Europe and the western hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 4.8% operationally. The success of new product launches made strong contributions to the results in all regions.","If you\u2019ll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $3.5 billion, up 37.1% compared with the 2012 results. Earnings per share were $1.23 versus $0.91 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. ","As referenced in the accompanying table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2013 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $42 million for after tax special items. Fourth quarter 2012 net earnings included a net charge of $809 million for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. ","Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.24, representing increases of 5.5% and 4.2% respectively as compared to the same period in 2012.","I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 32.5% was 170 basis points less than the same period last year. In the prior year, we recorded an inventory step up charge related to the Synthes acquisition that increased cost of goods sold by 130 basis points.","This charge was treated as a special item. Excluding the impact of this prior year inventory step up charge, cost of goods sold was 40 basis points lower than fourth quarter 2012, primarily due to positive mix lower costs associated with strong volume growth in our pharmaceuticals business, and cost improvement initiatives across many of our businesses.","This was partially offset by costs associated with the agreement with Vertex for Incivo related to royalties that was announced in the fourth quarter, inventory adjustments and the impact of the medical device excise tax. ","Fourth quarter sales and marketing and administrative expenses were 32.2% of sales, in line with the fourth quarter of 2012. Our investment in research and development as a percentage of sales was 13.1%, down 20 basis points due to timing of milestone payments in the pharmaceuticals business.","Interest expense, net of interest income of $116 million, was up $27 million versus the fourth quarter of 2012, due in part to a higher average debt level. Other expense, net of other income, was $868 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $319 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other expense net of other income of $47 million compares to $420 million of other income net of other expense. 2012 included a higher level of gains on divestitures. ","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 18% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide some commentary on taxes in his remarks.","Now turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the full year of 2013, consolidated sales to customers for the year 2013 were $71.3 billion, an increase of 6.1% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, sales grew 7.7% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 1.6%. Synthes, net of the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business, contributed 2.5 points to the worldwide operational sales growth. ","On the consolidated statement of earnings, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the box section. For the year, 2013 adjusted net earnings were $15.9 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were $5.52, up 10.7% and 8.2% respectively, versus the 2012 results.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the fourth quarter of 2013. I\u2019ll being with the consumer segment.","Worldwide consumer segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2013 of $3.8 billion increased 2.8% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 4.4%, while the impact of currency was negative 1.6%. U.S. sales were up 5%, while international sales grew 4.1% on an operational basis. ","Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, operational growth was approximately 6%, driven by strong U.S. growth of nearly 10%. Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 6.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Strong operational growth of 7.1% outside the U.S. drove the results, due to double digit growth of hair care and baby cleansers, complemented by the impact of the Elsker products acquired earlier this year.","Sales in the oral care business increased 2.3% operationally. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of manual toothbrushes in North America, fourth quarter operational sales grew approximately 4.5%, led by strong growth of 8.6% outside the U.S. with Listerine new product launches and new marketing campaigns.","For the fourth quarter of 2013, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals increased 6.6% on an operational basis, compared to the same period in 2012. U.S. sales were up 21.6%, driven by strong growth in analgesics and other key brands as we continue to make progress in returning a reliable cup of products to the marketplace.","Our skincare business grew 9.5% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter of 2013. Very strong results for Neutrogena and [unintelligible] with new product launches supported by robust marketing campaigns drove results in the quarter. ","Women\u2019s health declined 11.5% on an operational basis, due primarily to the impact of the divestiture of the North America sanitary protection business. Women\u2019s care other sales increased 2.6% on an operational basis, due to strong growth for BAND-AID brands.","That completes our review of the consumer segment, and I\u2019ll now review highlights for our pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter of $7.3 billion increased 11.8% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 13.1%, with a negative currency impact of 1.3%. Sales in the U.S. increased 17.9%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 9%.","Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas. Immunology products grew 22.6% operationally, with sales in the U.S. up 19.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 31.9% operationally. Earlier this year the company made certain supply chain changes for REMICADE, resulting in sales to distributors, previously recorded as U.S. export sales, now being recorded as international sales. Adjusting the base to reflect this impact, the fourth quarter 2013 U.S. immunology growth was approximately 26% and operational growth outside the U.S. was approximately 14%. ","In the U.S., REMICADE, excluding export sales, was up 12.7%. SIMPONI was up 65.6%, and STELARA was up 67.7%. Results were driven by strong market growth, complemented by increased market share for both STELARA and SIMPONI, with new indications and formulations introduced in 2013. With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. ","REMICADE, outside the U.S., adjusted for the supply chain change just mentioned, was up approximately 2% operationally, with strong growth in Canada, partially offset by the lower sales in Latin America due to pricing pressure and timing of shipments.","STELARA made significant contributions to growth outside the U.S., through the market share gains and market growth across the major regions, while SIMPONI\u2019s strong growth was due to increased shipments to our distribution partner and strong growth in Japan and other markets.","Sales of infectious disease products increased 9.9% on an operational basis. INCIVO declined 23.6% on an operational basis, reflecting lower sales in Europe, impacted by a combination of patient warehousing and patient enrollment in clinical trials in certain countries, partially offset by strong sales in other countries as we obtain reimbursements.","PREZISTA grew 30.3% on an operational basis due to continued momentum in market share growth in the major markets, while INTELENCE grew 12.7% operationally, due to double-digit growth in Europe.","The combined sales of [comblarent] and EDURANT also contributed to the results, as did sales of our newly launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and SOVRIAD in Japan.","Neuroscience product sales increased 0.7 operationally and were impacted negatively by generic competition. U.S. growth was 1.7% and sales outside the U.S. were flat on an operational basis. The long-acting injectable antipsychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved operational growth of approximately 15% due to an increase in combined market share.","Sales of oncology products increased 37.4% on an operational basis, primarily due to the strong results for ZYTIGA. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 85%, with similar results both in and outside the U.S.","In the U.S. very strong market growth of over 18% and increased market share in the combined metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer market drove results. ZYTIGA has captured nearly 34% of that market. Additional country rollouts and expansion of the label to chemo-na\u00efve patients drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries. ","VELCADE sales increased 7.4% on an operational basis. Strong performance and patient in the frontline setting, and the launch of the subcutaneous version, continued to drive sales growth, partially offset by the timing of tender business in the fourth quarter of 2012 as we discussed last year. Other oncology sales increased due to CAELYX sales. ","Regarding DOXIL\/CAELYX, ensuring a sufficient supply for physicians and their patients remains our urgent priority. In the U.S., we are experiencing a supply outage of DOXIL due to issues at our third-party manufacturer. We continue our discussions with the FDA regarding short term plans and other long term options for manufacturing.","The FDA has approved a generic doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, which is currently available for patients. In Europe, we are continuing to supply CAELYX. In the third quarter of 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, approved manufacturing of CAELYX from an alternate supplier as part of our long term transition to a new manufacturer.","Other pharmaceutical products increased 0.5% on an operational basis, with strong results for XARELTO and INVOKANA, partially offset by lower sales for ACIPHEX. XARELTO nearly tripled compared with the same quarter last year and grew 10% on a sequential basis, reaching over 38% of the new to brand scripts, or NBRX, in cardiology in December, surpassing warfarin by over 7 points. ","Total prescription share in the broader anticoagulant market grew 1.5% on a sequential basis to 10.5%. INVOKANA contributed 2 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate and at the end of the quarter achieved 19% NBRX with endocrinologists, within the defined market of type II diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin. INVOKANA holds the number one position for branded non-insulin NBRX in that market. ","Some updates of note for our pharmaceuticals business. During the quarter, the FDA granted approval of OLYSIO (simeprevir) for combination treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Simeprevir was also approved in Japan and Canada. In Japan, it is marketed as SOVRIAD, and in Canada as GALEXOS.","The FDA also approved IMBRUVICA to treat mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, for patients who received at least one prior treatment. The European commission approved INVOKANA for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes and we expect INVOKANA to be available in Germany and in the U.K. this quarter.","A complete response letter, or CRL, was received from the FDA regarding the fixed dose combination of Canagliflozin and immediate release metformin to treat adults with type II diabetes. The CRL requests additional information to support the comparability of twice-daily dosing and the once-daily dosing of Canagliflozin as a single agent. We believe we can supply this information based on available clinical data. ","In addition, SIRTURO received a positive opinion from the European CHMP for use as part of combination therapy to treat adults with pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis. A marketing application was submitted to the European Medicines Agency for ibrutinib for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or relapsed or refractory MCL.","The [DLA] for [unintelligible] received a priority review designation in the U.S., and esketamine was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for treatment resistant depression. ","And last week, the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted against the approval of the use of XARELTO in patients with acute coronary syndrome. We will work with the FDA to address the questions raised.","In addition, the rights for DORIBAX were returned to Shinogi earlier this year and the U.S. exclusivity period for ACIPHEX expired in the fourth quarter and the copromotion agreement with Eisai was terminated. Eisai will continue to market and produce ACIPHEX in the U.S. The copromotion agreements in certain international companies were also terminated. ","That completes the review of the pharmaceutical segment. I\u2019ll now review the medical devices and diagnostic segment as well.","Worldwide medical devices and diagnostic sales of $7.3 billion decreased 1% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 1.5%, with a negative currency impact of 2.5%. Sales in the U.S. declined 1.4%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 3.7%. Adjusted for divestitures and exits from certain businesses, underlying operational growth was approximately 2%. ","Starting with cardiovascular care, sales were up 8.3% operationally, with the U.S. up 12.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.7% operationally. Biosense Webster achieved worldwide operational growth of over 13% in the quarter. The success of a number of catheter launches and market expansions made strong contributions to the results.","Diabetes care declined 11.9% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter of 2013, with the U.S. business down 25.8% due to the impact of lower price, primarily related to competitive bidding. The business outside the U.S. was flat operationally, with increased sales related to the launch of [Animas Five], offset by lower sales on meters and strips.","The diagnostics business declined 9.4% on an operational basis, impacted by the divestiture of the [unintelligible] business, while infection prevention increased 5% on an operational basis with similar results both in and outside the United States.","Orthopedics sales were up 4.2% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2012, with the U.S. up [4.9]% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.5% on an operational basis. Strong growth for knees and hips drove results this quarter, partially offset by slower sales for spine products. Growth was positively impacted by trauma results versus the fourth quarter last year.","Operationally, hips were up 5% worldwide, driven by 8% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary same platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were up 2% on an operational basis.","Knees worldwide increased 8% on an operational basis, with 9% growth in the U.S. and 6% operational growth outside the U.S. The successful launch of the ATTUNE fixed bearing knee drove the results, partially offset by pricing pressure.","Trauma was up 7% on an operational basis with the U.S. up 10%. Results in the fourth quarter last year were impacted by a [nail] recall. Outside the U.S., sales were up 4% operationally, driven by growth in Asia Pacific, with new product launches.","Worldwide spine was down 2% on an operational basis with the U.S. down approximately 5%, impacted by pricing pressure, the continued softness in the market, as well as the disruption in the commercial sales organization as we integrate the businesses. Outside the U.S., sales were up approximately 2% operationally, due to growth in Asia Pacific. ","Specialty surgery operational growth was 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. U.S. sales were up 1.8%, and sales outside the U.S. were up 10.7% on an operational basis. International sales of energy products, and strong sales of biosurgical products, were the major contributors to growth, complemented by U.S. growth from market expansion for our [clearance] products. ","Surgical care worldwide sales were up 1% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 3.1% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.4% operationally. U.S. sales were impacted by lower sales of women\u2019s health and mechanical products. Outside the U.S., suture sales and strong demand for EndoCutter products with the ECHELON FLEX powered [endocut] stapler were the important drivers of growth. ","Rounding out the review of the medical devices and diagnostics segment, our vision care business achieved operational sales growth of 2.6% in the fourth quarter, with the U.S. down 0.4% and sales outside the U.S. up 4% operationally. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses, partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses in the U.S.","That completes highlights of the medical devices and diagnostics segment, and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter of 2013. It is now my pleasure to turn the meeting over to Alex Gorsky. Alex? ","Alex Gorsky","Well, thank you very much, Louise. I\u2019d like to welcome all of you participating in today\u2019s meeting, especially those, recognizing that we\u2019ve got this big weather storm forecast, at least for those of us here on the East Coast. It\u2019s great that you were all still able to make it. And for all of those of you who are on webcast, welcome. I hope your weather is better, and we\u2019re glad that you could also join us for the event today.","When we look back on it, I think and hope you\u2019ll agree, 2013 was really a significant year for Johnson & Johnson. In fact, it\u2019s pretty hard for me to believe that it\u2019s only been a year since we met in a hotel not too far from here in 2012 to review our performance in 2012 and also set out the goals for 2013.","And while I think time has passed relatively quickly, I\u2019m also very proud to report just how much we\u2019ve accomplished since last year\u2019s meeting. So let\u2019s start first with our near term priorities.","Number one, we\u2019ve exceeded our financial commitments. We continue to restore a reliable supply of the majority of our over the counter products here in the U.S., and we\u2019re working very closely with our trade partners to get product back on the shelves and really relaunch these great brands.","We\u2019ve also made substantial progress on the integration of Synthes, and we\u2019re creating not only the world\u2019s largest, but the most comprehensive, orthopedics platform in business in the industry. And very importantly, as you heard Louise talk about, we\u2019ve continued building on our strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business, which is leading the industry on so many different fronts.","We\u2019ve made a lot of progress against the short term drivers, but we\u2019ve also advanced our long term growth drivers as well, things like creating value through innovation, having a global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution in everything we\u2019re doing, and leading with a purpose to really make a difference for patients, for customers, around the world.","At the same time, we are focused hard on leveraging the power of our enterprise in a number of ways that are serving to increase the overall effectiveness and efficiency of Johnson & Johnson. Let me give you just a few examples.","Number one, we\u2019ve improved our quality programs, but we\u2019ve also strengthened and streamlined our supply chain to ensure that we can reliably meet demand around the world. We\u2019ve also bolstered our postmarket surveillance and safety teams. We\u2019ve acted decisively to prioritize our product portfolios, focusing on areas where we really think we can apply our energies to make the greatest opportunities to lead the industry and ultimately make a real difference for patients. And we\u2019ve worked hard to resolve certain complex legal matters. ","Meetings like this, these types of forums, we believe provide us with a great opportunity to update you on our progress, as well as our plans and our perspectives about how we think things are going to unfold in the future. Dominic and Louise - and you all know Louise, she always has that big binder - she\u2019s going to take us through a lot of information today. Any really tough questions we\u2019ll make sure she can find the answer somewhere in there.","But I personally believe that while you\u2019re going to hear a lot of different information, the most important takeaway from today is for you to better understand why all of us at Johnson & Johnson remain so optimistic about our future and our ability to positively impact the lives of patients and consumers, in spite of so many global challenges facing healthcare delivery around the world.","So let me start the way I always do. Let\u2019s talk about our credo. 2013 was the 70th anniversary of this document, so our management teams around the world did a credo challenge, and really spent time considering what it means today to our business, what it means to us as leaders. And we collectively confirmed that it is as essentially as ever.","Now, as we\u2019ve grown to more than 128,000 associates around the world, this brief but very powerful document really unites us with a common purpose. And I believe it remains as important and as relevant today as ever, and its principles are very deeply embedded in the way we conduct our business and the way we do everything.","As you all know, the most important driver of success is ultimately the people who make these strategies come alive. And I\u2019m really proud of our executive management team. When you look at this group, they have a wide range of diverse backgrounds and experiences, and it\u2019s a nice combination of long, tenured, seasoned Johnson & Johnson executives and newer additions to the leadership team with strong and diverse industry backgrounds.","And together, I believe we\u2019re poised to lead and frankly to shape the evolving healthcare industry and market, and really bringing new ways of doing business, coming together with customers, governments, and payers.","We\u2019re proud of our strong foundation, but we\u2019re also embracing changes that we think are demanded by a healthcare landscape that\u2019s changing in so many different ways. We\u2019re decisive, we\u2019re disciplined and focused against executing on our near term priorities, but also staying focused on our longer term growth strategies.","So with that as a bit of a foundation, let\u2019s take a look at our performance overall for 2013. The advancements we\u2019ve made by working with such a laser focus on our near term priorities has had a direct impact on us being able to deliver our results. And the enterprise grew 6.1% versus 2012.","As you heard earlier, that\u2019s 7.7% operationally on strong sales of $71.3 billion. And if you net things out for the Synthes acquisition operational sales growth was still a really solid 5.2%. With our continued focus on financial discipline, our adjusted earnings were $15.9 billion, up 10.7%. And adjusted EPS was $5.52, up 8.2% versus last year.","We also generated significant free cash flow, at $13.8 billion. As the largest healthcare company in the world, our broad base of leadership is increasingly important in our ability to deliver strong results in a sustainable way over time. As you can see, our consumer segment accounted for 21% of our total sales by generating $14.7 billion, up 2.8% on an operational basis versus 2012 and nearly 4% operational growth excluding the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures. ","40% of our sales, or about $28.5 billion, come from our medical devices and diagnostics group, with operational sales growth of 6.1%, which now includes Synthes for a full year. If we exclude acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was approximately 1%. Our pharmaceuticals segment generated $28.1 billion, an outstanding 12% operational growth versus 2012, and that accounts for the remaining 39%. ","On the strength of this performance, we generated $19 billion in pretax operating profit, excluding special items, a 90 basis point improvement versus the previous year. Pharmaceutical pretax operating margin grew 370 basis points due to its strong sales performance.","And we also saw a nice uptick in our consumer group. The decline, however, in MD&D was driven by lower diabetes pricing and of course the medical device tax. And our shareholders, they were rewarded with a return of almost 35%, which really outpaced about nearly every major index we benchmark ourselves against.","If you look long term, we believe our shareholder have also done well, and we\u2019ve outpaced each of these indices over the past 10 years. We\u2019ve delivered 30 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases and 51 consecutive years of dividend increases, making us only one of six companies in the S&P 100 to achieve that kind of a record.","The depth of our leadership is reflected by the fact that approximately 70% of our sales come from the number one or number two market share position, and we\u2019re seeing that our investments in research and development are helping us to continually deliver meaningful innovation to the customers, with about 25% of our sales coming from products that have been introduced or launched just within the last five years.","Now, we believe these facts demonstrate that our business is strong, and I\u2019d really like to congratulate the associates of Johnson & Johnson around the world for their commitment to delivering this kind of success. ","We\u2019re very fortunate at Johnson & Johnson to serve more than a billion healthcare patients and consumers around the world each and every day. It\u2019s the responsibility of everyone across our great enterprise, and we consider it a privilege, and actually a great source of pride. So let\u2019s go through some of the highlights.","Growth in the consumer segment was achieved in part as a result of our success in restoring a reliable supply of OTC products to the United States marketplace, and we\u2019re starting to see them gain traction as well, once they\u2019re back in the market. ","So I\u2019d like to acknowledge Sandy Peterson for her leadership in this segment over the past year. Together with Lynn Pendergrass, who joined us in September as the worldwide chairperson for the consumer segment, they\u2019re building a best-in-class global marketing organization to continue growing the image and share of these iconic brands.","Now, part of that effort also includes focusing the portfolio to meet the evolving needs of customers in local markets around the world. To do this, we\u2019ve identified a select set of specific consumer need states and have developed 12 major brands that we believe are going to drive the majority of our growth.","And many of these major brands grew well in the fourth quarter, including Neutrogena, Listerine, [Baby], and particularly Tylenol and Motrin, which drove U.S. OTC growth of about 22%. And we\u2019re going to continue backing these brands with strong scientifically based and endorsed claims to differentiate them in the marketplace.","In line with these efforts, we\u2019re going to tighten our focus. We\u2019ve divested in certain areas such as North America women\u2019s sanitary protection business. We acquired Elsker, a leading Chinese baby products company. And we also continue to expand globally the launch of things like Listerine Advanced Defense Gum Therapy in places like the U.K. and Ireland and our new Johnson\u2019s Baby Triple Protection product line, which we\u2019re taking out to global markets this year.","As all of you know, in OTC, our priority for the past several years has been to deliver a reliable supply of products to the marketplace. And last year, very importantly, we met our objective of returning approximately 75% of our planned portfolio to the store shelves. U.S. OTC ended 2013 with the number one or number two product SKUs in both adult and pediatric pain categories. And we\u2019re also investing in things like cross channel marketing across TV, print, social media, to really support their launch and do it in a benchmark way.","Finally, as we work to bring our plants fully back online, we\u2019ve executed all of the milestones to date in our FDA consent decree. This is very important. So with the significant progress that we\u2019ve made in returning our U.S. over the counter products to the shelves, a tighter strategy on focusing our portfolio, our consumer business is well-positioned to continue to grow in 2014 and beyond.","So, with MD&D, let\u2019s talk first about the market dynamics. The early fourth quarter data we\u2019ve seen frankly shows mixed performance. It generally indicates that rates of surgical lab procedures here in the U.S. basically remained flat over the last 12 months, and we\u2019ve discussed that with you in prior meetings.","However, there\u2019s also some signs, some early signs, of improvements in areas like orthopedics. So overall, we believe that as economies recover, healthcare reform starts taking hold here in the U.S. and abroad, utilization rates are going to increase, and we remain very confident in the long term prospects for this market.","Now, that said, we know that our growth long term is going to be outlined by our ability to continuously deliver innovations that ultimately make a meaningful difference for patients and for our customers around the world. As you know, Johnson & Johnson is the leading company in this segment, with 85% of our key platforms in the number one or number two position in the market. ","Integrating Synthes has been our number one priority, and we\u2019ve made good progress on that, and I\u2019ll discuss more of that in just a moment. Our emerging markets in this segment are also a really important driver of growth, and we\u2019ve been successful in developing, making products specifically for these markets that are driving growth within our medical devices and diagnostics segment. ","And we\u2019re also increasing our competitiveness in this dynamic global market, in order to better position our business for future growth by investing in innovations that will help us increase our leadership positions by optimizing our portfolio to ensure we\u2019re focusing in areas where we feel we can really have the greatest impact.","Now, DePuy Synthes is the world\u2019s largest and most comprehensive orthopedics company within a $44 billion market that has got strong fundamentals. And it is primed now to offer new, value added solutions that will help transform healthcare delivery, let alone in orthopedics.","Orthopedic operational growth for the full year of 2013 was approximately 2% worldwide, excluding the net income of the Synthes acquisition. But we finished the year strong, with solid fourth quarter operational growth of over 4%, representing our strongest quarter of the year. ","Now, in the quarter itself, worldwide operational growth of 8% in things like knees, 5% in hips, were the major driver of this performance. Our primary goal during the integration of Synthes has been to continue to grow our strong market position while minimizing customer disruption. ","And we clearly acknowledge we still have some more work to do, but I\u2019ve been very encouraged, particularly as of late, to see some of the steps we\u2019re doing in things like cross-selling initiatives that we had envisioned from the onset, as we see these things starting to take hold, as well as revenue and cost savings synergies that are going to make this business extremely competitive going forward.","And the team is also taking a lot of important steps to integrate the internal systems and processes which of course these kind of things are foundational to make sure we set it up for the long term success that we know it deserves.","We have a strong leadership position in the medical device market, anchored by $11 billion plus platforms, including things like vision care, trauma, sutures, endoscopy, electrophysiology. And we\u2019ve got a lot of others that we believe have got the potential to get there.","One of these is biosurgicals, which develops sophisticated products used to help control bleeding. This platform grew 8% operationally in 2013, and we\u2019re especially excited about the EVARREST fibrin sealant patch, which has demonstrated a really unique ability to control bleeding in a variety of situations that\u2019s far superior to the current standard of care.","It\u2019s now proved in both the United States as well as in Europe, and we\u2019re making good progress on our ability to make sure we have the right production capacity in place, because we believe we\u2019re going to have strong demand. But in the meantime, we\u2019re taking very thoughtful and disciplined approaches to allocating our current limited supply. ","Our ability to readily develop and launch new products is ultimately what drives this business, and so in the last two years alone, we\u2019ve invested approximately $3.5 billion in research and development to advance this portfolio even further. And it\u2019s brought some strong, dynamic products to the market over that time span, including things like the ATTUNE knee system, which now we have over 23,000 implanted worldwide. It\u2019s off to a very successful start.","The ENSEAL G2 articulating tissue sealer is making it easier for surgeons worldwide to assess difficult to reach places and parts of the anatomy. It\u2019s a great technology. And also, our THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH contact sensing catheter, which actually measures the contact force of a catheter\u2019s tip inside the heart during an ablation procedure. It\u2019s enhancing outcomes for patients in Europe, and we plan to launch it in the United States later this year.","Its uptake has helped drive double digit operational sales growth at Biosense Webster, and I had the pleasure of visiting that team earlier this month and I can tell you the team is smart, committed, passionate to delivering even more innovations for healthcare that we think are also ultimately going to drive that business forward.","The products that I have mentioned are just a few of the really exciting and dynamic innovations that demonstrate our ability to meet the needs of surgeons and healthcare systems, and I\u2019d like to recognize our two worldwide chairs in this segment, Gary Pruden and Michel Orsinger, and their teams, are doing to grow this business.","While we\u2019ve launched a lot of great products, and invested a lot in research and development, we\u2019re also being prudent about how we\u2019re allocating resources with respect to our medical devices and diagnostics portfolio. And as we\u2019re doing across the entire enterprise, we\u2019re realigning our organization to focus on what we believe are the most promising opportunities.","In line with our emphasis to increase the focus within our portfolios, we have a company-wide premise that we should be number one or number two in the categories where we compete, have a clear path forward to getting there, or the businesses must really complement one of our other existing businesses. And if we don\u2019t have businesses that meet those requirements, we\u2019re committed to considering strategic options for them. ","Now, if you remember, last January we made a decision to explore strategic options for the ortho clinical diagnostics business. As we explored strategic alternatives over the course of the year, we determined that divestiture would be ultimately the best option for this business, and also create the greatest value for Johnson & Johnson.","On Thursday, we announced that we received a binding offer from the Carlyle Group to acquire it for about $4 billion, and we\u2019re now in an acceptance period that will end on March 31. We expect that this transaction will close sometime during the middle of the year. ","Ortho clinical diagnostics plays a very important role in healthcare, and we\u2019re confident that it\u2019s well-positioned to continue serving the interests of patients, customers, and employees. And we\u2019re also very committed to working with the Carlyle Group to make sure that this transition goes as seamlessly as possible during this period.","Now, let\u2019s move on to pharmaceuticals. You know, by any measure, the performance of this group has really been exceptional. We\u2019re the fastest growing of the 10 pharmaceutical companies in the United States and Europe and Japan. We recorded 15 consecutive quarters of operational sales growth in this segment.","We believe our success is driven by several important factors. First, as always, it starts with great science, which has consistently delivered meaningful advancements for patients over existing therapies. The 13 new products that we\u2019ve launched since 2009, coupled with the core strength of our brands, including PREZISTA, REMICADE, and VELCADE, have greatly contributed to our 2013 operational sales growth in this segment.","We\u2019ve also continued to see great productivity in our pipeline, with the launch of three new major medicines this year: INVOKANA for the treatment of type II diabetes, IMBRUVICA for mantle cell lymphoma, and OLYSIO for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. We\u2019ve been very successful in sourcing these innovations, both internally as well as externally, and we expect to continue this strategy. ","Next, and very importantly, I believe our teams have done a great job in executing strong clinical development programs to optimally characterize these therapies. As an example, consider the extensive number of patients we\u2019ve enrolled in registration trials for XARELTO, and the direct comparable claims that we have on the label of INVOKANA, and multiple indications we\u2019ve obtained for XARELTO and ZYTIGA.","Third, we\u2019ve really solidified our commercial excellence in programs and launch execution processes. Our recently launched products have done extremely well in terms of launch uptake, and it\u2019s really impressive when you consider some of the new competition that\u2019s entered the market as well.","And fourth, we\u2019ve increased our access through strong reimbursement and contracting abilities. The comprehensive drug profiles and dossiers really make a strong difference when you go to the market and help our account teams gain broad access so that patients globally can ultimately have easier, broader access to our products.","And we believe these important elements are going to continue to position us for growth well into the future. And it\u2019s really also a testament to the great work that\u2019s been done by Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels and their teams to develop and execute this plan so well.","Now, XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA illustrate the type of dramatic launch success we\u2019re seeing here in the United States. XARELTO total scripts in cardiology continue to increase and now have over a 20% share, even in the face of new competition. And INVOKANA\u2019s uptake is making it rapidly becoming the world\u2019s leading agent among endocrinologists in new to brand share in ZYTIGA. Even with new competition, it\u2019s steadily gaining share.","And together with its 88% share in the G5 markets across Europe, ZYTIGA is a strong contributor to over $1 billion in sales that have been generated in oncology, just within the fourth quarter, which is a milestone for that therapeutic category.","Looking to the future, we\u2019re really pleased with the focused, deep, and productive pharmaceutical pipeline. And we expect the growth of our recently launched products to continue and actually accelerate. Furthermore, we\u2019ll continue investing in research and development that\u2019s focused on key unmet needs for patients.","And as we announced at the pharmaceutical segment business review last May, we plan to file more than 10 NMEs for approval between 2013 and 2017, and over 25 additional line extensions for our end market products.","Looking ahead, we know that healthcare is evolving quickly, so I want to provide our perspective on where we think it\u2019s going, and how we\u2019re shaping and redefining our businesses to make sure that we\u2019re ready and lead through this wave of change that we expect to happen in the healthcare marketplace. ","The opportunity in healthcare is immense, with an overall spend of about $8.4 trillion, and with the demand for healthcare products worldwide services, it continues to grow and is being driven by an aging population and an increasing middle class.","At $2.5 trillion, products account for nearly 30% of that spend, growing 3-4% a year, and the health services industry, which accounts for $6 trillion, is expected to grow by more than 5%, despite going through radical changes as healthcare ministers and governments across the globe press for greater transparency around cost and quality. So yes, these dynamics, these influencers, certainly present challenges.","But they\u2019re also creating significant opportunities for Johnson & Johnson, and we\u2019ll optimize the breadth, the depth, the size and scale of our businesses, and manage and lead through this cycle to meet the evolving stakeholder needs, frankly, that they\u2019re demanding. ","And our position in the industry we believe provides us with a unique perspective, but also a responsibility. We believe healthcare is clearly one of the greatest challenges facing society today, for every country, every community, every company, and every family. And we believe that there are at least four imperatives for a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of healthcare globally.","First, our industry has got to make it a priority of expanding access to high quality, affordable, and sustainable healthcare in every community. Access to high quality healthcare isn\u2019t just a cost. Rather, we think of it as an investment in society\u2019s future, productivity, and frankly the overall quality of life.","Second, we\u2019ve got to make sure that the market is designed to encourage and reward innovations that add demonstrable value in terms of improved outcomes for patients. In spite of all the advancements over the past several decades in treating thins like cardiovascular disease, cancer, HIV, and other areas, we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do to cure things and take care of areas such as Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, other infectious disease. These things are going to create significant additional burdens on the healthcare system if we don\u2019t make progress, and if we don\u2019t do something about them.","Next, we believe that care integration could also help solve so many of the issues that we\u2019re facing in healthcare. When we say care integration, it isn\u2019t just about products. Innovating new ways of partnering reimbursement, better integrating some of the insights and data into the overall management of healthcare is essential. ","And we think that it can improve outcomes, potentially increase patient satisfaction, and definitely contribute to better cost management over the long run. If we only focus on the direct costs of one particular area and aspect of healthcare, or if we fail to keep the patient at very center of how we\u2019re doing this reform, it just won\u2019t be successful. ","Finally, we believe there\u2019s got to be a greater focus and emphasis on wellness and prevention. Although the world is making great advances in sick care, the best answer to deal with the growing epidemic of chronic disease is healthier lifestyles, a true dedication to wellness. ","And we realize that this is not easy, but as we\u2019ve seen with our own employees, investing in health and wellness programs has a positive and long term impact on welfare and on cost. To me, that\u2019s one of the most promising frontiers around innovation.","So with that as a backdrop, here\u2019s our strategy for continuing to lead and succeed in this evolving healthcare marketplace. Our strategic framework for achieving our future growth goals should be very familiar to you. It naturally starts with our credo.","And it\u2019s our aspiration that by caring for the world one patient at a time, we\u2019re going to help billions of people around the world live longer, healthier, and happier lives. If we look at our longstanding strategic principles, we know that they\u2019ll remain the same at the core. However, we\u2019re also evolving these to make sure that we stay in tune with the current environment.","And we\u2019ve discussed these principles with you many times, but I\u2019d like to focus on one for our discussion today, which is increasingly important given some of the changes we\u2019re seeing. And we believe that our broad base in healthcare, and the strength of Johnson & Johnson as an enterprise, will be a very important differentiator in our evolving landscape.","Think about it for a moment. The diversity of our science, technology, the product offerings, provide us with a unique perspective to address complex unmet medical needs within a rapidly changing healthcare environment. It enables us to maintain a strong footprint and presence in growth markets that represent an increasing share of our business. And it enables us to sustain consistently strong financial performance for a wide variety of business cycles.","The power of our broad base starts first with the strength of each one of our different segments. This is a snapshot of our segment by segment strategy that we\u2019ve discussed with you on previous occasions. And this is going to continue to be the driving engine of most of our growth, and it\u2019s our first intention to lead within each one of these segments with a strong focus on innovation, globalization, execution, and leadership. ","At the same time, we intend to use the power embedded across these segments in order to advance new ideas, new products, services, that will enable us to continue to optimize our resources and scale and to outpace the rate of change in the industry. To do so, we\u2019re dedicating teams to implement a core set of enterprise wide initiatives that will equip us to act in a more nimble and dynamic way in support of our growth strategy.","As all of you know, everything begins with innovation, and for the past five years we\u2019ve consistently invested about 11% of our net trade sales to support our research and development efforts, that equated to over $8 billion as an enterprise in 2013. Our distinct innovation model is predicated on accessing the very best science to address unmet medical need and then leveraging our own specialized capabilities to develop differentiated products.","As you know, we\u2019re agnostic as to where the ideas emanate from, and we\u2019ll access the best science internally or externally. We\u2019ve demonstrated the success of our approach first in our pharmaceutical business, and we\u2019re applying the same philosophy across all of our other segments as well.","In fact, we\u2019ve been relentless, and have executed over 200 alliances, licensing, and acquisitions, and strategic partnerships across the enterprise just over the last two years. Our chief scientific officer, Dr. Paul Stoffels, chairs our worldwide research and development management committee, and he works with our R&D leaders across the company to set and drive the enterprise wide innovation agenda by harnessing our deep internal expertise and platform capabilities, as well as by sourcing in external innovation to really fuel our pipelines. ","We\u2019ve gotten off to a head start on this industry model by launching four innovation centers in key research communities around the world. These teams have quickly established credibility and trust, and have already inked over 40 early stage deals. Paul has done a tremendous job in leading the innovation platform, and his leadership and track record of success is widely regarded across Johnson & Johnson, but even more importantly across the industry.","In fact, just a week ago, Paul was recognized by the leading life science CEOs with the prestigious lifetime achievement award. He really deserved it, and we\u2019re incredibly proud of him. Congratulations, again, Paul.","In addition to doing smart deals and focusing our R&D teams to increase our productivity, we believe that we\u2019ve also got to offer innovative solutions. As I said earlier, it only matters if the best science can really be effectively delivered to customers and patients. And we\u2019re going to measure our long term success by our ability to leverage the specialized capability of the Johnson & Johnson enterprise to achieve three key objectives that healthcare stakeholders today are demanding.","They are improving outcomes, increasing patient satisfaction, and reducing costs and increasing access to healthcare around the world. Of all the companies in Johnson & Johnson, and in healthcare, we are uniquely positioned to create new and different partnerships that align with hospitals and payers, strategies, to transform from volume based systems to value based systems, with the ultimate goal of affordable solutions to deliver a better clinical outcome and patient experience.","We\u2019ve already established a new deployment model and enterprise wide account team that can represent our entire portfolio in unique ways to each customer, in order to customize the best solution for that particular customer. And our teams have been working for several months to create and execute pilots with a few prominent healthcare systems here in the United States, and to enhance some of the work we\u2019re already doing more broadly with other customers as well.","It\u2019s early on, but I\u2019m particularly excited about the possibilities. Now, a good example of how we can deploy differently to better serve customers is in knee replacement procedures. We actually have several comprehensive offerings, but I\u2019ll just touch on about four of them this morning.","First, Care for Today Orthopedic Solutions focuses on improving continuity of care and recovery through patient education and empowerment, but as well as by providing post-surgery support both in the hospital as well as at home.","Second, True Match brings a new level of personalized total knee replacement surgery to the OR, based on the proven philosophy of mechanical alignment with customized patient instruments and systems that are designed to really aid in knee implant positioning and to increase the efficiency of the procedure as well.","Third, with SterilMed integrated reprocessing, we aim to deliver direct savings to hospital budgets by combining both new and previously reprocessed instruments in one simple, sterile container.","Finally, we\u2019re piloting a procedure based outcome contracting agreement that\u2019s essentially a risk sharing program with hospitals to [unintelligible] positive readmission trends. This is just one example of an industry mindset, a changing approach, and really that\u2019s accelerating the realization of our vision to reshape the healthcare delivery system with total solution offerings that add value to the system and ultimately expand our business.","And so as we expand our businesses, particularly in other parts of the world, we\u2019re increasingly executing our globalization strategy with an enterprise wide lens to better drive our success in this markets. These charts demonstrate an increasing importance that these countries have to our overall business. For example, in 2013, 55% of our sales came from markets outside the United States while emerging markets accounted for roughly 22% of our total sales.","Johnson & Johnson has been operating in China for over 28 years, and while many of our competitors are currently expanding in the region, our strong heritage and business foundation provides a unique viewpoint for us to look at growth.","When I met with you last January, I discussed the potential of our business in China, which, given the population, unmet medical needs, demographic changes, and steps the government is taking to enhance the healthcare system and expand that access, we believe it represents enormous opportunity.","The Chinese market, the healthcare market, is large and growing, and healthcare expenditures are expected to increase about 14% a year through 2017. Today, it\u2019s almost $3 billion, it\u2019s a $2.8 billion business for us, and the dynamic environment there really demands new ways of working, which relies on the strength of our combined three businesses. It capitalizes on our scale, our breadth, as well as the very unique strength of the Johnson & Johnson brand equity.","So we\u2019ve taken important steps to invest in continued growth there. Last fall we appointed Jesse Wu to the role of chairman of Johnson & Johnson China, a new enterprise wide leadership position. Jesse comes from the region, and he\u2019s been a leader within our great company for more than 25 years, and he\u2019s got a strong track record of success. But he\u2019s working now to optimize our capabilities and really to drive growth in China by enhancing our ability to meet the country\u2019s unmet healthcare needs.","Each of our businesses still runs their respective businesses. However, in his chairman role, Jesse is representing a consistent Johnson & Johnson interface to key external stakeholders, particularly to the government and to the talent that we\u2019re trying to bring into the organization. And from his enterprise wide vantage point, he\u2019s going to be better suited to identify, facilitate, and actually create opportunities for growth going forward.","The enterprise wide view looks a little bit different in Southeast Asia, where we\u2019ve rolled out a model that we call One Johnson & Johnson. There, we\u2019ve aligned our operations and management for nine different countries, including Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and we\u2019ve brought it into a single, $1.4 billion business. Now, in this construct, we think we\u2019re going to be more efficient while also increasing our ability to compete in these smaller midsized markets with more streamlined approaches led by one managing director.","Also, foundational to our growth strategy is excellence in execution. It\u2019s essential, and as we did in defining the best strategies for growing our business, we\u2019ve also spent a considerable amount of time and energy examining our internal processes and structures as well. The entire executive leadership team at Johnson & Johnson has been focusing on ways to ensure that every product we test, that we develop, that we manufacture, achieves world-class quality standards, allowing us to responsibly meet the demand of customers and consumers and patients around the world.","And our focus has been on strengthening and streamlining our supply chain to ensure that we can reliably meet demand. And as I said earlier, we continue to meet the goals under the consent decree to bring our United States over the counter products back online. ","We\u2019ve also implemented a new quality and compliance operating model, which is ensuring more consistent standards and capabilities are in place across all of our product lines, our businesses, and different geographies.","And our chief medical and chief quality officers are setting new benchmarks in medical safety and implementing a more consistent global approach for monitoring the use of our end market products that\u2019s very patient and consumer centric for ensuring that they are safe and performing as expected and as intended.","And while we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made here, we\u2019re not yet satisfied, and we\u2019ll keep doing whatever it takes to ensure that we continue to earn the trust of consumers and patients around the world.","Stay with me for a moment on excellence in execution. Last year we kicked off an enterprise wide standards and productivity initiative to strengthen our functional capabilities around the world, in order to better enable first our businesses to grow, but also continue to improve our cost competitiveness.","We\u2019ve already identified benefits from this effort, and we project that we\u2019ll achieve approximately $1 billion in savings over the next three years that we can reinvest back in the business. And also, it helps us offset some of the expected pricing pressures that we anticipate on the horizon in this healthcare environment.","It\u2019s also our belief that Johnson & Johnson holds a greater responsibility to lead with a purpose, and that by doing so, all of our stakeholders will benefit as defined by our credo. Our success is measured by our ability to advance the health and wellness, by improving the quality of people\u2019s lives. And through contributions of about $1 billion in products and cash, we\u2019ve supported over 500 community programs in more than 60 countries in 2013 to address the unique needs of families and communities around the world.","First, we\u2019re committed to advancing global health to fight multi drug treatment resistant tuberculosis and are working with health authorities to make SIRTURO, which has received a positive CHMP recommendation for approval in the European Union, and was just approved in Russia, more available also in other parts of the world.","We\u2019re also continuing to enter royalty free licensing agreements to make SIRTURO and other important lifesaving medications available in other developing countries. And we\u2019ve got a strong track record of doing this, and today 66 countries have at least two of our four HIV medicines available at special effort pricing.","We also believe in wellness, and we\u2019re proud to be sponsoring a program right here in the United States, in fact right here in our backyard, in cities such as Atlanta and with school systems in Houston and Philadelphia and Newark, working with our Human Performance Institute, which trains high performing athletes and executives to work at peak levels. ","We\u2019ve engineered and launched a Johnson & Johnson seven-minute workout app. It\u2019s a fast, scientifically proven, app, simple, for your mobile device. So there\u2019s no more excuses. It\u2019s got over 1,000 exercise options, and it\u2019s free on iTunes and on Android. I hope you\u2019ll download it and give it a try. New Year\u2019s resolution.","Our engaged teams do a tremendous job every day, and I\u2019ve been talking with you for about the last 45 minutes about the collective results that we\u2019re very proud of. And I\u2019d like to again thank each and every one of our associates around the world for their continued commitment to the success of Johnson & Johnson.","As we enter this year, we\u2019re going to remain focused on driving growth with the continued execution of our long term priorities: one, achieving our financial targets; two, restoring a reliable supply of OTC products on the shelves here in the United States and relaunching them, making sure that they have best-in-class launch and support programs positioned to gain share; continuing to capitalize on some of the potential of DePuy Synthes as an innovative driver of growth in orthopedics and continuing to build on the strong momentum that we talked about with our pharmaceuticals team, as well as our long term growth drivers of globalization, innovation, execution, and leadership.","Just a few final thoughts. Never before has the healthcare industry operated in a time of such remarkable change and also creating such dramatic opportunities for us. In this environment, it\u2019s absolutely essential that we balance our focus on our core capabilities and strengths while also adapting better to evolving customer needs. To succeed, we\u2019re taking new approaches, working more collaboratively, and shaping our company to ultimately execute more efficiently. Johnson & Johnson is strong, and poised for growth.","Our success over time will be how we live up to the responsibilities, the commitments, laid out in our credo, and helping patients and customers live longer, healthier, and happier lives, creating an environment where our employees can be their very best, excel and innovate, of taking care of the communities by improving their access to care, and by continuing to generate a fair return for our shareholders.","I couldn\u2019t be prouder to be part of this organization, and this incredible team, at this pivotal time. Thank you very much for your support of Johnson & Johnson. ","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Alex, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some comments on our 2013 fourth quarter and full year results, and then provide some guidance for you to consider as you update your models for 2014.","It\u2019s really a great pleasure to report on our exceptional performance in 2013, which was driven by the many successes that Alex previously discussed. Our strategy and momentum positions us very well to continue our strong momentum and performance in the evolving healthcare marketplace.","At the beginning of 2013, I provided you with an outlook of our financial performance for the year. We saw continued improvement in our results throughout the year, driven by stronger sales results and good expense management. Our operational sales growth of 7.7%, as Louise described earlier, exceeded our guidance of 6% to 7% for the year.","I\u2019m also pleased to report that we\u2019ve improved our pretax operating margin, excluding special items, by 90 basis points, and that our net income margin, also excluding special items, expanded to 22.3%.","During the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items that netted to approximately $40 million on an after tax basis, and which consisted of the following: increased litigation accruals; a charge for in-process research and development; costs associated with the Synthes acquisition, which are consistent with what we expected we would incur as special items throughout 2013, and which we expect will continue as that integration activity continues; an increase in our estimate for the costs associated with the DePuy ASR hip program for updated information primarily related to the program outside the U.S.; and finally, during the fourth quarter cumulative losses exceeded the net worth of [sios inc.]. ","This necessitated the writeoff of the acquired entity for tax purposes, which was previously written down for books purposes. This resulted in a tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter as a special item. Together, these special items negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.01 per share. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.24 for the fourth quarter. ","During the fourth quarter, our tax planning efforts resulted in a lower tax rate, which offset some additional cost in the fourth quarter related to the buyout of a royalty agreement and the planned shutdown of certain manufacturing operations with the resulting writedown of those related assets.","Overall, the net impact of these items, along with the higher level of sales in the quarter, resulted in our EPS exceeding the mean of the analysts estimates as published by First Call.","Now, to wrap up our formal presentation this morning, I\u2019d like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2014. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of 2013, we had approximately $11 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $18 billion of debt.","As you know, we recently completed a $3.5 billion debt offering. We did this to lock in some attractive long term rates, and while this financing does increase the overall borrowing costs compared with shorter-term commercial paper rates, on a long term basis the rates we obtained are very attractive. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I\u2019d suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $500 million, reflecting a higher level of interest expense than some of you have modeled.","Now, turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arriving from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and also divestitures, asset sales, and writeoffs.","This account is always difficult to forecast, but we would be comfortable with your models for 2014, reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $600 million to $700 million, a lower level of income than some of you have modeled.","And now a word on taxes. For 2013, the company\u2019s effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 17.2%, which was lower than our recent guidance, as we were able to implement some tax planning items late in the year. ","This effective tax rate for 2013 includes the federal R&D tax credit for both 2012 and 2013. You may recall that the 2012 portion of this credit was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D credit will be renewed by Congress, although that has not yet occurred. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014, excluding special items, of approximately 18.5% to 19%.","If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5%. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities to improve upon this rate throughout the year.","Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions and key factors which I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models. Those key assumptions and factors are as follows.","For sales, our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2014, and for INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not anticipate generic entries for these products this year.","And as for earnings, there are several factors to note. First, some comments about foreign currency fluctuations that impact real economic transactions as opposed to only translation, which I will discuss later.","As we discussed on our third quarter call, the Japanese yen devalued by approximately 25% versus the U.S. dollar and the euro in 2013. The impact of the yen devaluation on 2013 results was not significant because of our policy of hedging foreign currency transactions 12 to 18 months in advance.","However, the impact of the devaluation of the yen will be a significant headwind in 2014 and our 2014 guidance reflects a negative impact to gross margin in 2014 of approximately 60 basis points, or an equivalent net impact to EPS of approximately $0.11.","The yen weakened due to many factors. When foreign currency shifts are of a significant magnitude, it is not only difficult to adjust spending accordingly to offset the total impact, it\u2019s often not prudent to do so given the long term impact of such actions compared to the potential shorter term nature of the currency impact. Our guidance assumes we will have offset some of this impact, but not all of it could be mitigated. ","Likewise, in the event of a significant devaluation of any other major currency, such as the Venezuelan bolivar, we will look to mitigate that impact, again depending on the magnitude of the impact. Such a potential devaluation of the bolivar or any other currency is not reflected in our guidance.","Finally, as you know, we announced that we have received a binding offer for our clinical diagnostics business of approximately $4 billion. We expect the transaction to close within the next six months, and that the resulting gain will be treated as a special item. Therefore, it will not impact our guidance at this time. When we update our guidance after the transaction closes, we will of course indicate the impact a divestiture would have on our sales and earnings per share, excluding special items, for the remainder of the year.","As of today, we are considering how to best allocate the net after tax proceeds from the divestiture in order to minimize the go forward dilutive impact of not having that business contributing to our results in the future.","As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.","We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. As of last week, the euro had strengthened versus the U.S. dollar as compared to 2013 average levels. However, many other currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar as compared to their average levels for 2013.","Considering these factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting on an operational basis a sales increase of between 3.7% and 4.7% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 on a constant currency basis of approximately $73.9 billion to $74.7 billion.","We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates for all of 2013 were to remain where they were of last week, then our sales growth rate would have decreased by nearly half a percentage point. Plus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to range between 3.2% and 4.2% for a total expected level of reported sales of between $73.5 billion and $74.3 billion, which at the midpoint is consistent with the analyst models as reflected in First Call, even considering the headwind of recent currency rates.","Now, turning to earnings, our guidance reflects the major assumptions I noted earlier, specifically the negative impact of the weakening of the Japanese yen, which we estimate to be approximately $0.11 to EPS. As many of you are aware, we do not treat amortization expense as a special item. Our earnings guidance includes total amortization expense for the enterprise of approximately $1.3 billion on a pretax basis.","We also expect to experience pricing pressures in 2014 across many markets, particularly in Europe. The impact of this negative pricing pressure is expected to negatively impact our pretax operating margins by approximately 50 basis points. Considering the factors I just noted, we suggest that you consider full year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.70 and $5.80 per share on an operational or constant currency basis.","Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for all of 2014 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share due to exchange rate fluctuations.","We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS, excluding special items, in the range between $5.75 and $5.85 per share, or a growth rate of 4% to 6%. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.","As you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pretax operating margins will show a slight improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels, despite the negative impact of the devaluation of the yen on our gross margin, and the expected incremental pricing pressures. This is due to continued focus on our operating expenses. You should also see that our net income margin will be approximately flat with prior year, due primarily to the increase in our effective tax rate.","In closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our overall results for 2013, and we expect our growth and momentum to continue into 2014. We have the financial strength and breadth to execute on our near term priorities and to deliver solid results while also continuing to invest for long term growth.","I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn it back to Louise for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Louise Mehrotra","Thanks, Dominic. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. Please wait for the microphone, as we are webcasting the meeting. And as we have our CEO with us, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could keep your questions to the strategic level. ","Matthew Dodd - Citigroup ","Alex, for you, and the nice thing about the slides this year and last year is there were some tables that were the same. Emerging markets was actually 23% last year. This year it was 22%. Some of that was obviously U.S. pharma. Consumer did really well. Can you give us an idea of what you\u2019re seeing in emerging markets broadly, what you may have seen in the fourth quarter, and your expectation for \u201914 maybe versus \u201913 in emerging markets, particularly?","Alex Gorsky","I think overall the headline that I\u2019d encourage you to think about is we think that there\u2019s a big growth opportunity in emerging markets. And in spite of some quarterly ups and downs, in spite of a few shifts here and there in specific segments, or product performance, we see that these markets will likely continue to grow at about 3 to 4 times the growth rates that we\u2019re seeing in developed markets over the next several years.","And so specifically for Q4, there were things in Q4 2012 that you\u2019d have to think about in \u201913, but overall what we\u2019re seeing, for example in BRIC markets, growth for the year is about 12%. And we saw performance slightly lower than that in Q4, again impacted by a number of factors.","If we look at our current business, clearly MD&D is our leader in the BRIC markets, and has done very well. What you see is high teen growth, sometimes exceeding 20%, based upon the investments that we\u2019ve made in research and development, manufacturing, and commercial presence in those markets. ","Our consumer growth has also done well in them, impacted somewhat recently by some of the ingredient issues that we faced, but here too we\u2019ve got a lot of market appropriate products. We\u2019ve invested significantly as well in manufacturing and commercial capabilities.","And obviously our pharmaceutical group is a little bit different, because we have been very open about our strategic intent not to participate in the generic segment, which has an impact there. But we still believe there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to address both unmet need as well as the business opportunity with some of our higher technology products. ","And by the way, if you look at some of the other investments that we\u2019ve made in companies like [unintelligible] several years ago, recently with Elsker, which expanded our presence in the baby segment. We also did the MD&D investment in our biosurgicals business, which will help us expand that platform there in the coming years. We remain very confident in the opportunities for growth there in the future.","Louise Mehrotra ","If I could just add something also onto that one? We had, as I discussed in my remarks, with Russia, with the tender, VELCADE, and we also had some tender business on REMICADE. So in the emerging markets, you have a lot more of tender business, and it can cause some fluctuations.","","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","First question, Dominic, the constant currency, or actually operational, I don\u2019t know if operational is actually constant currency. I think it\u2019s [unintelligible].","Dominic Caruso ","Yeah, that\u2019s the way we refer to it.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","Just to be clear, you don\u2019t have divestitures in there too, right? You have a bunch of divested products and businesses that you\u2019re not backing out?","Dominic Caruso ","Right, when I talk about operational, I\u2019m just talking about excluding any impact of currency only.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","Okay. The 3.7% to 4.7% would imply a deceleration from 2013 and certainly the way the year ended up. Could you talk about why that would be the case? Obviously it\u2019s tough to sustain 12% revenue growth, but you\u2019ve got a lot of momentum in that business, so what are you assuming decelerates in 2013? Or are you assuming no improvement in MD&D as well?","And then the second question, and this is both a Dominic and Alex question, but one incredibly underutilized asset at J&J is the balance sheet. We\u2019ve been talking for years about the cash that\u2019s trapped outside the U.S. It\u2019s significant. It\u2019s growing. All your cash flow is outside the U.S. after you pay your dividend. At what point do you change your thinking on this and actually start to repatriate?","Dominic Caruso ","On the growth rate, I think it\u2019s a story of a very high base in the pharmaceutical business after a tremendous year. And in fact, although the pharmaceutical business will continue to grow, it just won\u2019t grow at the same rate that it grew at in 2013, given the high base that it\u2019s already at after a pretty fantastic year.","So that alone, I think, accounts for the majority of the difference and what you\u2019re referring to as a deceleration in growth. We do expect MD&D and consumer to pick up in growth. I think the pharma comparisons are tough year over year. And I think we ended the year at good, strong growth. We did have some good opportunities in the year that, again, form a base for which then to grow off of, makes it just difficult. ","It\u2019s early in the year. This is our view. We try to take everything into consideration. We provide you our estimates, but that\u2019s our current expectation of course [unintelligible], throughout the year. ","If I can give just a few comments on cash, obviously cash, we generate, as you know, mostly outside the U.S., and it does grow, because of our healthy cash position. We obviously look to maintain the increase in our dividend, so we don\u2019t view that as a hindrance to doing that. We\u2019re still able to do that.","And we view that as a great opportunity to invest in the long term growth market, and as you saw with the Synthes transaction, where we were able to use cash outside the U.S. for a significant acquisition.","So we\u2019ll always look to do those kinds of things with the cash first, continue our dividend and invest in growing the business. But at some point, and I\u2019m not prepared to give you that point today, at some point we would consider whether repatriating the cash would be a prudent thing to do.","At the current U.S. tax rate, and with the current penalty, quite frankly on the repatriation, it appears to us that that\u2019s not a good way to utilize the cash, and it provides for a significant diminution in value to our shareholders by doing so. ","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Alex, you\u2019ve discussed publicly that you\u2019re reevaluating your cardiovascular medical device strategy. It\u2019s an area where you have a strong presence in only one area. How do you view the attractiveness of those markets now, and how important is it for J&J to have a stronger presence in the cardiovascular device space?","And my follow up is, the orthopedic commentary was encouraging, that you made earlier. How confident are you that that\u2019s not a pull-forward, ahead of the implementation of the ACA? Any signs that you can point to that give you confidence that that\u2019s sustainable?","Alex Gorsky ","Let me start with the first one. Overall, we continue to think that the cardiovascular area is certainly an area of a lot of unmet medical need, and also represents an opportunity for us. I think the decision we made several years ago, of streamlining our current cardiovascular portfolio, was in fact the right one. And if you take a look at the dynamics in the stent market, even more broadly in CRM and some other areas, they\u2019ve been pretty challenging lately, for a number of different reasons. ","And so I think making that decision helped us better focus on areas like EP and Biosense Webster, where I couldn\u2019t be more proud of that team. I think we\u2019ve got over 15 quarters of about 13%-plus growth. And at the same time, we made significant investments in new technology that continue to enable them to improve patient outcomes with new product launches.","I think we\u2019ve also done a very nice job, and I compliment Gary Pruden and Shlomi Nachman on the job they\u2019ve done in the rest of the business, in streamlining what we\u2019re doing in the endovascular space as well. So if you look at overall performance of our cardiovascular group through some very prudent, relatively minor investments, and frankly just better execution, that business we think is on much better footing now than it was before.","We noted really over the last 24 months that we\u2019re continuing to look at renal denervation. Of course you saw the recent information that was released by one of our competitors regarding their device. We have our own approach. We remain hopeful in this area. As we know, if we can truly achieve some of the drops in blood pressure that we\u2019re seeing in some of the other trials, that could have a tremendous impact for patients. So we continue to pursue that.","We\u2019re looking at AAA, obviously. We continue to be interested there. And we\u2019re watching the other spaces accordingly. I think the transcatheter aortic valves are still in the midst of their launch, working their way through not only the technology issue. Of course they only have two options on the market. As they work their way through reimbursement, we\u2019ll watch that closely, as well as the others. So we remain interested, but we think being where we are right now is a good place to be.","If I look at orthopedics for a moment, we were encouraged by the trends that we saw really later in the third and heading into the fourth quarter. As I mentioned during my talk, I think the data is still somewhat mixed overall, if you take a look at utilization. So let\u2019s start with the hospital data. A lot of you share that. If you look at in patient procedures, if you look at surgical procedures, if you look at outpatient procedures, if you look at lab tests, they remained essentially flat through the end of the year. We saw physician visits up slightly, and I mean slightly, 1-2%, and of course we saw improvements in hips, knees, and trauma in the fourth quarter.","I\u2019m really proud of what our DePuy Synthes team did in the fourth quarter. If you look at our underlying hip business, we grew 5%. On a worldwide basis, we grew 8% in the U.S. If you look at knees, we grew 8% worldwide. We grew 9% in the U.S. If you look at trauma, we grew 7% worldwide, we grew 10% in the United States. And the 10% was somewhat accelerated because of what happened in the fourth quarter of last year.","But if we look at more underlying fundamentals, what we\u2019re seeing with accounts, what we\u2019re seeing with customers in the field, we remain very hopeful. We think we\u2019re going to have to watch the Affordable Care Act and its impact here in the United States closely. Just recently the Congressional Budget Office, as well as [unintelligible], if you look at their assumptions and projections about numbers of patients, I think they\u2019ve been reduced substantially, based upon sign up rates. ","So we do expect there to be some assistance there, probably not at the rate that was earlier projected. And of course there\u2019s also the fourth quarter dynamic in the orthopedics market of, you know, people utilizing all of their healthcare benefit as well.","So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic, I would say, regarding the fundamentals of some of these markets. Longer term, we still think they represent a very significant opportunity. ","Unidentified Audience Member ","One question you mentioned in your presentation, Alex, this performance based risk sharing arrangement that you\u2019re pursuing within orthopedics, something that\u2019s worked for you in the past [unintelligible] in RISPERDAL. If you could talk a little bit about that, and whether we\u2019re going to see more of that in devices?","Alex Gorsky ","As I mentioned, and actually as we\u2019ve envisioned over the past several years, we have a strong belief in the evolving healthcare marketplace today that in many areas, that customers, certainly hospitals under increasing pressure, are going to be looking for, frankly, ways of creating new partnerships with customers and moving from just a volume based model to a much broader portfolio model.","And as we look at that, and we think that we\u2019re very well-positioned, and I want to be clear that our number one focus is still on bringing new, innovative products to market, gaining share, we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity. But we also think that the unique depth and breadth of our portfolio, especially in areas like orthopedics, where we touch so many of the different spaces, but even more broadly, if you just think about a knee or a hip procedure, and if you combine what we do in the surgical side, with our hemostats, with our energy instrumentation, along with what you might see in the prosthetic device and instruments itself, potentially longer term even with our pharmaceutical line, we think that we have a unique offering. And so on a selective basis, right now, we have been working with customers to contract with them in a different way.","And so again, it\u2019s still early, but we think in the right areas, this can be a substantial opportunity for us to grow our share as well as to work closely with hospitals in helping them better manage outcomes and costs.","Unidentified Audience Member ","And one follow up, if I could, on spine. Not to pick on a place where you\u2019re seeing some continued challenges, obviously very strong hips and knees, but the integration, the market, maybe share dynamics, can you give us a sense of maybe intermediate, long term strategy for getting that back to market, or better growth rates?","Alex Gorsky ","That\u2019s a good point. We continue to believe that the spine market long term is a very good opportunity. When you talk about it, I think the number two reason why someone goes to a physician, or makes a physician visit, is for back pain. We know that that market has undergone a lot of change over the past few years, and we certainly felt that. ","We do feel, if we look at the overall integration of DePuy Synthes, that one challenge for us was clearly in the spine. And we recognized that going into it, when you had to bring that organization, that\u2019s where the greatest amount of overlap versus hips, knees, and trauma, sports medicine, and other areas. And we did see higher sales force turnover, frankly, than we would have liked to see.","I think Michel and Gary Fischetti and his team have done a nice job of addressing many of those concerns. I think our performance in Q4, while still not where we want it to be, is showing some improving trends, in fact outside the United States we\u2019re actually positive. And also, with some of the complementary nature of some of the underlying technology that we have in the other orthopedic segments, that scientifically, commercially, contractually, it will be an important piece of our business. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll get that back to a growth rate that may not be reflective of the growth rate that you saw several years ago, that we saw several years ago in spine, and nonetheless is a healthy and sustainable one for the business.","Rick Weiss - Stifel Nicolaus ","Maybe I\u2019ll focus first, Alex, on consumer, if I could. You said that 75% of the products are back. Clearly you had a good quarter. A couple of things there. What\u2019s it going to take to get all the way back, recapture that full revenue you lost? And maybe relative to product reformulation, like we saw a newspaper report on Sunday, article about taking certain products out, is this going to slow your progress as you reformulate?","Alex Gorsky ","I\u2019d like to note, and first of all, congratulate Sandy, Lynn, and our entire consumer team, for what I do think was strong performance throughout 2013, but certainly in Q4. And just a couple of things to note. One is we obviously have been really focused on making sure that we meet all our consent decree requirements. And we\u2019ve learned a lot through that process. And it\u2019s taken an integrated effort on the part of our supply chain, our information technology group, our business partners. ","And sitting here today, having met all of our consent decree requirements thus far, we continue to gain confidence now in our ability going forward to do just that. So we still have a substantial volume that we would have to make up to get back to the earlier volumes that we saw, but every time we introduce the product to the market, Extra Strength Tylenol, if you look at Children\u2019s Tylenol, Children\u2019s Motrin, pediatric, we\u2019re seeing customers respond. ","We began not only focusing on the remediation, but really the relaunch program, on the McNeil team, particularly in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m sure you saw some of that in the media and the advertising. We\u2019ve seen a very nice response and uptake as a result of that.","And so we continue to bring things back online, but obviously we\u2019ve got to do that in a very thoughtful, disciplined way, to make sure we meet all of the requirements as well as launch them.","The other factor is, though, we\u2019re very pleased with the partnership that\u2019s been taking place with our major trade partners. So all the major outlets have been enthusiastic about working with us to get these brands back on the shelves.","Now, while I\u2019m very proud of that, I\u2019m also very proud of what we\u2019re seeing in our core brands. And so if you look at the core strength of things like baby care, up 6% for the quarter, Listerine, up 6%, actually about 8.5% outside the U.S. If we look at OTC, you heard 21-22% growth in the United States, very strong growth. Overall, skin was up over 9%. And that\u2019s really being driven by Jennifer Anniston and the campaign, the great science and technology and Neutrogena, Aveeno turned in strong growth. ","And so as you know, in the consumer group it takes great scientifically driven innovation, combined with strong innovation in advertising, great retail partnerships and programs, to really drive that together, but I think now we\u2019re in a much better position with our core business as well as with our OTC business, to really have our consumer group deliver the kind of performance that we would expect longer term.","Rick Weiss - Stifel Nicolaus ","If I could ask an MD&D bigger picture question, you\u2019ve discussed this from several angles, but frankly, even though you\u2019ve got some amazing franchises, we all know it, the portfolio seems relatively overweighted in mature products and mature markets. And at this point, you\u2019re still growing, I would say it\u2019s a lower end of the industry\u2019s relatively depressed growth. Maybe you don\u2019t see it that way. I\u2019d be curious if you don\u2019t agree with that. ","You\u2019ve emphasized the need for meaningful innovation, you\u2019ve talked about your decisive portfolio and investment choices. What\u2019s your thought process about getting this portfolio back to industry growth? What\u2019s your sense of urgency? When should we think about you getting back to that sort of low to mid single digit growth for this business? ","Alex Gorsky ","It\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve been very open about our overall strategy for the organization of always having a goal of growing slightly faster than our markets at a minimum. And that remains our goal in MD&D. Now, if we project out that the underlying growth rate in MD&D is somewhere between 3% and 4%, we clearly want to do better than that.","And if I look at performance over the course of 2013, I think there are reasons to believe and be more optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing. Now, you always have to be thoughtful when you take a look at the numbers, but if we account for acquisitions and divestitures, and there was a significant swing also on the diabetes test strip, if we pull those things out, we\u2019re seeing a growth rate of about 3.2%, which we think is pretty indicative of the over marketplace.","And that\u2019s in spite of a lot of churn that we\u2019ve had in other areas of that business. And I think as we look forward, we talked are looking at orthopedics, what we\u2019re doing there, I think we\u2019re in a much better position there as we\u2019ve ended 2013 and we\u2019re setting ourselves up for the future. ","If you look at a few of the other areas in MD&D, where we know we can improve performance, we\u2019re also making good progress. So, for example, if you look at the innovation in energy, the G2 articulating device that we have coming out, the [unintelligible] HARMONIC seven, we think is going to have us be much more competitive, and we\u2019re introducing those to the market, literally as we speak. I think biosurgicals is another area that\u2019s going to be a strong platform for growth going forward as well.","So we do think this should be a business that\u2019s growing in the areas that you mentioned, and that I mentioned earlier, and it could be a very strong supporter overall for Johnson & Johnson well into the future.","Obviously, we are also looking at the portfolio. I want to congratulate the work the team did with ortho clinical diagnostics. First start by thanking our employees there through this process, for the great job that they\u2019ve done, but also the work that the team did in working with Carlyle. And we continue to look at other areas of our portfolio as well to make sure we\u2019re investing where we can make a big difference for patients, where we can have strong market positions and ultimately lead to future growth.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse ","Alex, two questions for you. Firstly, on the MD&D portfolio, diabetes has clearly had a structural change. What\u2019s your thinking on that and the fact that those go, does that leave kind of a portfolio deficit where given diagnostics\u2019 departure and potentially diabetes\u2019 departure you\u2019d like to have another growth engine there?","And secondly, you mentioned in your comments that one of the things that J&J is focusing on on the pharma side is both commercial excellence and execution as well as regulatory expertise, and you have two great drugs, INVOKANA and XARELTO, and they don\u2019t have big categories around them. And are those areas, metabolic and cardiovascular, where there are very interesting assets out there that you might be pursuing? ","Alex Gorsky ","Good questions both. You know, first of all, let me start with diabetes. We remain committed in the diabetes space. The fact that there\u2019s over 350 million people around the world that have type II diabetes, and if we look at the projections going forward and the unmet medical need that exists in that space, it\u2019s important that we continue to do work there.","Now, over the course of 2013, given some of the changes that we saw and the over 70% reduction in some of the bidding here in the United States, we had to make necessary changes to our business model, which we did make during the course of the year. And those are always painful, but I would actually applaud the work that our teams have done in that area to quickly reorganize and focus their business. And in fact, we\u2019re somewhat encouraged, even in Q4 of this year, we had growth outside the United States in our diabetes unit.","And we also started, with the launch of INVOKANA this year, a very unique partnership between our Lifescan group as well as our Jansen Pharmaceutical group, and we jointly focused in endocrinology, and we also feel that that partnership and the broader offering that we were able to bring into that office led to the rapid uptake in endocrinology, where we actually passed Januvia, fairly early on, and we\u2019ve continued to maintain that.","So long term, obviously we\u2019re going to continue to take a hard look. We\u2019re committed to that business. We think that overall diabetes is an interesting space, but we also recognize that we\u2019ll need to change the shape and how we function within that as we go forward.","So that would be my position on diabetes. Regarding INVOKANA and XARELTO, look, we think that these are both great products. In fact, rather than products, they\u2019re almost platforms within products. And that\u2019s certainly true when you have a compound like XARELTO, and the great job that Paul and his team have done on expanding the indications, rapidly getting six indications, the data that they\u2019ve built, the very large clinical trial database, combined with the commercial excellence that Joaquin and his team have provided. I think they\u2019ve done a great job, and we think that there\u2019s further opportunities for growth there as well.","And certainly the same when we look at INVOKANA. We have combinations that we\u2019ll continue to work on, and there\u2019s still a lot of unmet need, and we\u2019re very early in the launch process there. But we think that overall the area of cardiovascular, metabolic disease is an important one, and one where we want to play.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein ","I was wondering if you could spend a few moments talking a bit about what you\u2019re seeing in Europe, and kind of the utilization environment there broadly across your various businesses. You did, Dominic I think, call out pricing as a concern for next year. So maybe you can kind of expand on that and give us your outlook there?","Dominic Caruso ","Sure, just some comments on Europe. We did see some stabilization in certain parts of Europe, where as you all know, you\u2019re following, in southern Europe there was a significant decline in utilization. So that\u2019s stabilized a bit, although we don\u2019t see significant growth in utilization in those parts of Europe. And we do see, as reflected in my comments, a continued pressure on pricing, particularly in Europe and particularly in the regions that have had the lower utilization rates. Rather than a resurgence of growth, we see actually a continued decline due to pricing in those markets.","Alex Gorsky ","One thing that I would add is, as we look at Europe, there\u2019s a couple of ways to view it, I think one is clearly we saw an impact over the last few years with things like austerity measures, increased queuing in our medical devices area, and perhaps some more challenging tenders. but I\u2019d also point out that if you look at the growth that we\u2019ve seen in our pharmaceuticals segment in Europe over the past couple of years, it\u2019s been exceptional. ","And I think what that demonstrates is that when you do bring pharmaceutical products to the market, that are very differentiated, that have strong science, strong labels, good clinical dossiers, and you match that with great account teams, great commercial presence, you can get uptake. And I think that\u2019s really been driving our success in that environment.","And look, we\u2019ve got a lot of pockets. We have pockets in our consumer area that have done very well in Europe, we have other areas in our MD&D, like I mentioned the specific comments about diabetes, given some of the challenges how our business has done. Energy had done very well over the past couple of quarters there. So yes, it\u2019s a challenging environment, but it\u2019s also one where I think you can be successful ultimately, if you bring the right innovation the right way to the market.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital ","Really a question on the pretax margins. In pharma it\u2019s just been exceptional for the year. Clearly a continuous driver of new product opportunity. And the question there is, are we at the goal line? Or is there still more to be squeezed out on the pretax side?","And then second is really on consumer. With the increased cost of the relaunch, is there a substantial opportunity we can still see, even in \u201914, for improving pretax on that side?","Dominic Behan ","Good observation. It was exceptional growth in pharmaceutical margins. You know, I pointed out that our pretax operating margins this year will still expand, despite the negative headwind of the impact of the yen. So that should point out that underlying growth in the business and pretax margins, we still have that ability, and we still see it. ","We don\u2019t view it as squeezing out, though, just to correct that a little bit, because the business, as it grows, these products can generate a marginal improvement in pretax operating margin because of the fact that they\u2019re phenomenal products, and they\u2019re mostly specialty products, so there isn\u2019t a commensurate increase in the level of commercial investment. And plus, the commercial teams just do a fantastic job.","So I do think there\u2019s more room there. This particular year, though, as I pointed out, it\u2019s challenged because of the impact of the yen.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","Alex, a strategic question, obviously Synthes, for \u201914, you\u2019re pointing out as being a major strategic initiative for MD&D. I was wondering if you could help us understand, what do you see happening in \u201913, and what specifically is the focus in \u201914, and how it differs from \u201913. ","Alex Gorsky ","When you take on an acquisition and integration of an enterprise that size, over $4 billion in sales, many employees, it\u2019s a complex undertaking. And we knew from the very beginning that ultimately, looking at the number of people that are in the orthopedic space, looking at how that space is evolving, we felt very strongly the size, the scale, that the innovation technology advantage we\u2019d get from bringing that together is essential for success long term.","But in year one, you have a lot of the nuts and bolts, frankly, of the integration, just bringing them together on the ordering systems, getting the sales forces together, the compensation systems common, human resource programs, standardizing all of our qualities, supply chain, compliance programs. All of those kinds of things were really the focus at the tail end of \u201912. If you think about it, we didn\u2019t close until the second half in 2013.","I think we made a lot of progress in each one of those areas. Admittedly, there are going to be some bumps in the road when you do things like that, and the team went through that. But I think now they\u2019re focusing much more externally. ","So what I would say is as we move through 2013, there\u2019s still work that we need to do in bringing it together, but now the emphasis more is shifting into what does that ultimately mean for the customers. So how do we make sure that we work more broadly with the [AO] foundation to ensure physicians and surgeons are getting kind of the training and education that they desire. How can we work together even more closely in places like China, where we know that in the trauma marketplace there\u2019s a significant opportunity. ","I mentioned, I think, getting over some of the real challenges that we had in spine, bringing those two together. And frankly, in fundamentally changing this platform offering, instead of just the knee, just the hip, just bringing a much broader portfolio approach where we see a lot of interest on the part of customers, not only here in the United States, but also globally, to fundamentally transform the model. So I think that would be the fundamental shift that we\u2019re seeing. ","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","Very helpful. Maybe just two quick questions on cash. The first is, free cash in \u201913 actually came in a little stronger than we expected for the year, so nice job there. But how should we think about free cash for \u201914? Should it grow in line with earnings, faster than earnings? And the next question is, just as we think about the divestiture of the DX business, is the safest way to assume that money just stays on the balance sheet for strategic alternatives, or is there a possibility we could see a dividend or repurchase based on that cash proceeds?","Dominic Caruso","","Thanks for the comments on free cash flow. You know, our teams do a great job of managing not only the P&L but also the cash genomes. If you look at our history, our free cash flow essentially equates to our earnings, within a band of somewhere between 95% to 105%. So if you\u2019re modeling it within that range, that\u2019s about what we should expect. Obviously, there\u2019s payments, we have to pay litigation settlements, those sorts of things. That may swing it one way or another. ","But that seems to be the place that we\u2019re able, through our efforts, and through the teams around the world, generate significant cash flows that are essentially the same as the earnings that we generate, which is a remarkable achievement.","With respect to the OCD net proceeds, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s just early. We\u2019re going to evaluate how to best use those proceeds, but rest assured that as we think about how to best use those proceeds, we want to obviously offset the dilutive impact of not having the business in our go forward results. So there are multiple ways to do that. We\u2019ll consider the best way possible.","Louise Mehrotra ","Our final question will come from Kristen.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","Just a follow up, I guess, real quickly, before a question for Alex. Just on the [unintelligible] OCD, can you just give us a sense in terms of what the dilution would be, just assuming cash stays on and you don\u2019t offset it, how profitable that business is?","Dominic Caruso","The clinical diagnostic industry basically operates, and you guys can look it up, at a margin that\u2019s below the level at which Johnson & Johnson operates in total. And our ortho clinical diagnostic business is consistent with those industry margins. So think about it this way, I would size it up, you know, the sales of the business are about 2.5% of our total sales. Profitability of the business is less than that, because obviously it operates on a lower margin than the rest of our business. And if you take a half-year impact from the divestiture closing midyear, it\u2019s not a significant impact to the overall profitability of the enterprise at all. So that\u2019s the way I would think about it.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","And just big picture, strategically, a couple years back, Alex, your predecessor talked about potentially adding a fourth leg to J&J. And one of the slides you had today, you talked about the different areas within healthcare and you\u2019re looking at other areas like payers and providers, and just other general healthcare entities growing much faster than the businesses that you\u2019re currently in. So how do you just overall look at the positioning of J&J, in businesses that you\u2019re in today, adding a fourth leg or even just prioritizing your investments within consumer MD&D and pharma, given the differential in growth?","Alex Gorsky ","","We want to continue to identify and pursue areas where we think, number one, there\u2019s a lot of unmet medical need, and two, where we can work with technology and innovation to make a meaningful difference for patients and for our customers. And we think over the last few years, within each sector, if you take a look at some of the investments that we\u2019ve made and identified in our pharmaceutical group, that we\u2019ve done a very good job in accomplishing that. And that\u2019s resulted in products like ibrutinib, some of the partnerships that we\u2019ve had in other areas of our business, XARELTO and INVOKANA. ","And we would expect to continue that, and I think that our group has done a great job of identifying those kind of technologies very early, rapidly developing them, and bringing them to market in a great way.","I think in MD&D, we continue to innovate, but obviously we made a very big investment in Synthes, where we think size and scale is going to be important. But we\u2019re also focusing a lot on looking more broadly across our MD&D portfolio, on how we might work with customers in new and unique ways. ","And we\u2019ll continue to look for both new technologies within the different sectors we have in MD&D, but also for adjacencies that we think, again, help us better serve patients, but also broaden our offerings in some cases.","And in consumer, I think the team has done a great job, particularly over the past 12 months, of really better focusing the business. I mentioned that in my talk. And now, obviously, we\u2019ll take a hard look, but there we think there are a lot of regional opportunities. We think there are other areas of the portfolio that also we can augment. But we\u2019ve also demonstrated, I think, over the past couple of years, that we\u2019ve done a nice job on selected divestitures as well, to better focus some of our efforts.","So I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s a fourth leg per se, but I think we\u2019re always looking for big areas of unmet medical need, areas that may broaden our platforms, or that could provide a brand new platform going forward.","Louise Mehrotra ","And some final remarks from Alex?","Alex Gorsky ","Thank you very much, everyone. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s snowing yet outside, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear soon. I\u2019d like to end, basically, where I started this morning, and thank all of you for making the effort to be here and participating in today\u2019s meeting. ","As I said earlier in my talk, I think our strategic framework and our broad base of offerings, critical mass, and positions, really puts Johnson & Johnson in a good place to drive growth in today\u2019s marketplace. And this year we\u2019re going to work very hard on continuing to deliver new innovative products and solutions for consumers and patients around the world, and by implementing and focusing on those near term priorities I talked about, as well as the longer term growth drivers.","We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress against them, just as we did last year. And I\u2019d also like to ask you to please save the date for the medical device and diagnostics business review on May 22, which we\u2019ll host in New Brunswick. Again, that\u2019s May 22, in New Brunswick, for MD&D review.","So let me close by saying thank you, safe travels, and we\u2019ll look forward to seeing you next year. Bye for now.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Joseph Wolk","Hello, and thank you for joining us to review Johnson & Johnson\u2019s business results for the third quarter of 2017. I am Joe Wolk , Vice President of Investor Relations. I would like to provide a few logistics for today\u2019s call. ","This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. There you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and accompanying schedules. We anticipate today's webcast to last approximately 75 minutes.","Please note that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings, including our 2016 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com.","Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. ","I am very pleased to be joined by a few members from our executive committee, Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide some prepared remarks prior to the Q&A portion of the call. You will not only have the opportunity to pose questions to Dominic during that time, but also to each of our segment leaders.","Accompanying Dominic and I on today\u2019s call are Joaquin Duato, Executive Vice President Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, Jorge Mesquita, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Consumer, and Sandy Peterson, Executive Vice President Worldwide Group Chair. ","We are very pleased with our strong results as highlighted in this morning\u2019s press release and accompanying materials, the third quarter demonstrated an acceleration of organic sales growth and continued robust adjusted earnings per share. The anticipated acceleration of sales performance was most pronounced in the Pharmaceutical segment where key major brands are penetrating new markets and gaining share.","The Consumer segment returned to growth in the face of relatively soft global categories and worldwide medical device growth was relatively stable to second quarter levels. Sales performance in the quarter reflects the contribution from recent acquisitions, as well as the strength of new products across all three segments. ","Now, on to the details related to this quarter\u2019s results. Worldwide sales were $19.7 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 10.3% versus the third quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, sales were up 9.5% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8%. ","In the U.S., operational sales growth was 9.7% and regions outside the U.S. achieved operational growth of 9.3%. The effect of currency exchange rates positively impacted reported OUS sales by 1.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth for the enterprise was 3.8% worldwide. ","Net earnings for the quarter were $3.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.37 versus $1.53 a year ago. Excluding after-tax amortization expense, and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.90 representing increases of 11.2% and 13.1% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2016. ","On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10.1%. Dominic will provide additional commentary on our earnings in his remarks. I\u2019ll now summarize segment sales performance for the quarter with the intent of building upon the slides being presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2016 and thus exclude the impact of currency translation.","Beginning with the Consumer segment, worldwide sales grew 1.6% to $3.4 billion. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales increased 1.1% worldwide. Operational growth in this segment was driven by the Beauty and OTC franchises, each growing 4.4%. The results in Beauty were driven by strong OUS performance in the Vogue and NEUTROGENA brands.","Additionally, the Dr. Ci:Labo brand in Asia-Pacific is experiencing good uptake. Franchise growth excluding acquisitions was 2.1%. The worldwide Beauty market is estimated to have grown approximately 3% in the quarter and was modestly up in the U.S. In our OTC business, adult and children\u2019s TYLENOL continue to gain market share with adult TYLENOL benefitting from strong sales of the rapid release formulation.","Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care continues to be impacted by the new entrants to the market. However we\u2019ve remained the market leader. As previously communicated, we are actively working on relaunching these brands in 2018. ","Regarding our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales grew 14.6% to $9.7 billion. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational adjusted sales grew 6.7%, a clear acceleration of the growth over the first half of 2017. The strongest therapeutic area of growth was in oncology growing 24% overall. DARZALEX continued its robust performance with rapid uptake in the one prior line setting.","DARZALEX growth in EMEA drove results outside the U.S. with the product has now been launched in 25 countries. IMBRUVICA continues to gain market share globally. As you are aware, data lags for this product, but based on second quarter data, IMBRUVICA is now above 50% market share in the U.S. across all approved indications.","ZYTIGA growth in the U.S. was driven largely by a growing market which we estimate at approximately 13% and a slightly higher share both versus the prior year and sequentially. In immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 7%. STELARA in the U.S. gained 1.8 points of market share in the total immunology market versus the third quarter of 2016 driven mostly by strong adoption for the newer Crohn's disease indication. STELARA market share for the Crohn\u2019s in the U.S. is now estimated to be approximately 10%.","REMICADE in the U.S. declined a little more than 1% as it continues to compete in the face of biosimilar entries. REMICADE U.S. export and International combined declined 23%. While we continue to experience erosion from biosimilar competition in Europe, approximately two-thirds of this decline was attributable to the timing of shipments with our partner Merck. ","Within the Cardiovascular Metabolic Therapeutic area, XARELTO\u2019s growth of 20% was primarily the result of increasing total prescription market share, up almost 2.5 points versus one year ago. Warfarin continues to decline in favor of branded products. ","INVOKANA and INVOKAMET sales in the U.S. declined as we commented to in recent quarters, the primary driver of this decline is increasing discounts for the brand in managed care contracting and higher utilization in the Medicaid channel. There was also a loss in share of approximately one point. ","This is the first full quarter we are reporting pulmonary hypertension product results. On a pro forma basis, this therapeutic area grew 9% globally, 16% in the U.S. and 1% outside the U.S. Worldwide pro forma growth of better than 17% in OPSUMIT was driven by further market penetration and share gains. UPTRAVI up more than 70% and still largely a U.S. product is experiencing strong launch demand. TRACLEER was down about 14%, which is expected as business converged to OPSUMIT. ","To conclude the review of pharmaceuticals, I would like to provide additional context on a few of our late-stage compounds that were mentioned in today\u2019s press release. A new drug application for apalutamide was submitted to the FDA for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The filing was based on Phase 3 data from the Spartan trial which met its primary endpoint. We plan to present the study results at a major medical meeting in 2018.","Regarding talacotuzumab, based on a recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee we have discontinued treatment with talacotuzumab in AML 2002 as the phase 3 results did not demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio. We continued to assess the data to determine next steps in the clinical development program. ","Lastly, we have made the decision to withdraw the applications we had filed globally for sirukumab in rheumatoid arthritis. We are continuing to study sirukumab in major depressive disorder currently in Phase 2. ","I will now turn to our Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion growing 6.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.2% worldwide. The Vision Care business continues to exhibit strength. Contact lenses grew 5.3% worldwide as new products namely OASYS 1-Day and OASYS 1-Day for Astigmatism continued to be well received in the market.","Within the contact lens other line, there is $27 million associated with the recently acquired Consumer Eye Health products. The Vision Surgical business on a pro forma basis grew approximately 10% driven by the cataract business in the U.S. where strong adoption of the IOL TECNIS SIMPONI lens continues. ","We did experience a modest negative impact in our Hospital Medical Device businesses from weather-related events during the quarter. Based on a very preliminary analysis, we estimate that impact to have been a modest 30 basis points to overall total in this growth. ","Dominic will discuss this impact in the outlook of our future supply continuity in a few minutes. We\u2019ve routinely referenced general selling days. On a worldwide basis, selling day impact this quarter was negligible. Within Hospital Medical Devices, electrophysiology grew approximately 14% worldwide largely in line with atrial fibrillation procedure growth. ","The Advanced Surgery category grew 3.9% or 2.2% excluding the Megadyne acquisition. Energy is facing competitive pressures from reprocessing alternatives. Growth was largely generated by 13% OUS biosurgery performance with strength in the Middle East and Asia Pacific markets. Endocutters grew 6% outside the U.S. driven by ECHELON performance in China. ","Within general surgery, worldwide sutures grew approximately 5% behind strong growth of traditional and barb sutures in China. The decline in specialty surgery was driven by share loss in the aesthetics and infection protection businesses. The decline in orthopedics business versus the third quarter of 2016 was largely the result of share loss in U.S. Spine. We are working to expand our product offerings in faster growing segments. ","Performance in Knees outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by new legislation in India which is lowering the pricing of implants. That impact was approximately $10 million in the quarter, but since the legislation is retroactive to the beginning of the year, the third quarter represents three quarters worth of negative impact. ","Trauma grew 3.1% driven by solid growth in the U.S. market and strength in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Hips round out the orthopedic portfolio and that platform grew 1.5% globally as strength in the U.S. was driven by continued adoption of CORAIL. ","Pure pricing pressure continues across most orthopedic categories but favorable mix helped offset the erosion. For the quarter, U.S. price net of mix was negative 2.6% in Hips. Spine and Trauma net of mix were positive 2.1% and 1.2% respectively. Knee price net of mix was flat. ","That concludes the segment sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter of 2017. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments that occurred during the quarter. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Thanks, Joe and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. The performance highlights the many areas of strength in our business that have given us the confidence to stay throughout the year that we would accelerate sales growth in the second half of 2017. That was exactly what we delivered in the third quarter. We experienced organic growth acceleration most significantly in the Pharmaceutical segment as oncology and immunology products continued to grow at robust levels. ","The Consumer segment, which declined modestly in the first half of 2017 grew in the third quarter, while Medical Devices was relatively stable, but as Joe noted, experienced a minor negative impact to growth due to hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. In addition, we are very pleased with the performance from our recent acquisitions Actelion and Medical Optics which will continue to fuel our growth. ","And so, overall sales beat analyst estimates by approximately 2% or $350 million and adjusted earnings beat analyst estimates by $0.10 per share. I know for many of you there are questions regarding the impact of the unprecedented storms that occurred in the quarter. ","I want to take a moment to acknowledge the courage and resilience of all those who have been directly impacted by these storms. It\u2019s really been incredible. The response of the global business community has also been impressive and I am especially proud of the role Johnson & Johnson has played.","Our desire to improve lives is a foundational element in our credo and it is times like these when the character of our people who have been working on the ground side-by-side with relief organizations, and united effort to help their communities really shines proved. ","In terms of sales, the limited impact we experienced in the third quarter is not the result of any supply disruption, but rather lost surgery days in those areas affected by the storms. It remains to be seen whether volumes associated with those lost surgeries will be recouped in future quarters, however, in terms of future supply, we are very well positioned. ","We have six manufacturing sites on the island of Puerto Rico and considering the magnitude of the storm, our facilities fared well. All of our sites are open with reliable generator power operating in various stages of capacity while the work continues to ramp up to full operations in Puerto Rico. ","To ensure critical patient needs are met, we are closely monitoring inventories across our global manufacturing network prioritizing option of essential products and have already begun shipping newly manufactured goods from the island. ","While we cannot rule out the potential for intermittent shortages of certain product formats, many of our products have dual production sites and back-up supply outside of Puerto Rico to help meet demand. Based on what we know today, we do not foresee any material impact to future results. ","I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2017. As you heard, our operational sales growth this quarter was 9.5% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational growth was 3.8%. If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items.","As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures to 2017 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of $1.4 billion on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following. ","Intangible amortization expense of approximately $933 million, primarily from the recent acquisition of Actelion, litigation expenses of approximately $100 million, acquisition-related cost of approximately $280 million and a charge for the continuing restructuring of our Hospital Medical Device business of approximately $140 million. ","Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.90, up 13% and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.85 or up 10% over the prior year. ","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods increased by 430 basis points, primarily due to the inclusion of the amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up from our recent acquisitions. ","Excluding the impact of these types of expenses in both periods, cost of goods sold was 27.8% or 120 basis points lower than the prior year, mostly due to favorable product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were up 70 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2017, largely through the investment of new products in our Consumer segment. ","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 13.1%, up 90 basis points compared to the prior year as we continue to advance our robust pipeline of pharmaceutical products. And interest expense, net of interest income was a net expense of $155 million, slightly higher than last year.","Other income and expense was a net gain of $236 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $54 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are recorded in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of $517 million, compared to a net gain of $220 million in the prior year period reflecting completion of certain asset sales which were included in our annual guidance. ","I\u2019ll provide an update on this activity during my guidance comments. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 20.8% compared to the 19.7% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. I\u2019ll also provide an update on tax during my guidance comments.","Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2017, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the third quarter of 2016 driven by favorability in other income and expense line partially offset by the additional investments I mentioned earlier. ","Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, Medical Devices at 30.1% is lower than the prior year primarily due to higher investment spend to support new product launches. Pharmaceutical margins improved 110 basis points to 41% driven by favorable product mix. Consumer margins improved to 28% primarily due to the divestiture gains, partially offset by increased advertising and promotional spending.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion of net debt, which consisted of approximately $16 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of total debt. ","Therefore, for purposes of your models and assuming no other significant uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of $600 million and $700 million which is consistent with our previous guidance.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. As you know, one of our business priorities is to actively manage our portfolio to maximize value creation with the intention of redeploying most of those gains back into the business to enhance our long-term growth prospects. ","Consistent with our previous guidance, we are still comfortable with your models for 2017 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. This includes the gain associated with the sale of the Codman neurosurgery business which we closed subsequent to the third quarter. ","Regarding pretax operating margin, we expect that investment levels will increase and therefore we maintain our guidance that we will be flat to slightly decrease from 2016 level. This is of course offset by the divestiture gains I just mentioned. ","And now a word on taxes. As the Chief Financial Officer of one of the largest U.S. based multinational companies, I am often asked these days about perspective on tax reform. In fact, it is a topic I have been actively engaged in for more than ten years with legislators, as well as my peers across many industries. ","While our guidance today does not include any assumptions about potential tax reform measures, there are some points I\u2019d like to share as I do believe we now have momentum to attain meaningful and impactful business tax reform in the very near future. ","First, we commend our leaders in Washington for taking steps to address business tax reform and we see the united framework as a thoughtful approach to jumpstarting the U.S. economy, fueling U.S. jobs and U.S. investment one that will improve the ability of U.S. multinational companies to compete more effectively. ","The current tax system has not kept pace with modern innovation-driven global economy which results in an increasingly difficult business environment for U.S. based companies that do compete globally. To level the playing field with other industrialized countries, tax reforms should include three fundamental elements, a lower corporate income tax rate in line with other industrialized countries, the adoption of a modern, globally competitive International tax system allowing U.S. companies to manage their cash without tax penalty and of course greater incentives for innovation in the U.S. ","The framework addresses each of these elements and while clarity and additional detail are still needed in some elements, it is important that Washington and the business community unite now behind a tax reform bill that will have a positive impact on domestic jobs and on economic growth.","Having said all that and still remaining optimistic that something on this front can get done, we are not assuming reform in our 2017 guidance. Excluding special items, our guidance is 19% to 19.5% as at effective tax rate and this is a slight tightening of the range from our previous guidance. ","Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2017 does not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PROCRIT, PREZISTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.","We will of course also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2017 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to maintain the acceleration of our underlying sales growth for the balance of the year, and our major acquisitions of Actelion and Medical Optics completed earlier this year remain on track. ","As this is in line with our previous expectations, we are maintaining our operational sales guidance for the year in the range of 5.5% to 6%. This translates the sales for 2017 of approximately $75.9 billion to $76.2 billion on a constant currency basis.","We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as at last week with the euro for example at $1.18 for the balance of the year our sales growth rate would increase by 60 basis points versus our previous guidance. ","Thus, under this scenario, we expect reported sales growth in the range of 6% to 6.5% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $76.2 billion to $76.5 billion which is higher than our previous guidance.","And now turning to earnings. As I noted earlier, we plan to continue to invest in our growth opportunities and those plans are already in place. In the fourth quarter, as we did in the third, we will see an elevated level of R&D investment as well as additional investments in marketing programs behind the launches of several new products. Therefore, we continue to expect our pretax operating margins will decline somewhat from the prior year consistent with our previous guidance. ","We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of between $7.22 and $7.27 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of between 7% and 8%. This is a tightening of the range and an increase of about $0.02 over the July adjusted EPS guidance. ","If currency exchange rates for all of 2017 were to remain where they were as of last week that our reported adjusted EPS would be favorably impacted by $0.03 due to currency movements and this is an improvement from the negative impact of $0.05 in our previous guidance. ","Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $7.25 to $7.30 per share, an increase of $0.10 from our prior guidance and a growth rate of between 7.7% and 8.4%. So in closing, we are extremely pleased with the sales and earnings performance in the third quarter and our higher EPS guidance for 2017. ","In summary, we are maintaining our operational sales growth of 5.5% to 6% for the year, consistent with our goal of growing earnings faster than sales, our guidance for operational adjusted EPS growth remains strong in the range of 7% to 8% and our businesses continue to invest for the long-term while also delivering on near term priorities. ","So now I\u2019d like to turn things back to Joe to begin the Q&A portion of the call while I am delighted to be joined by Joaquin, Jorge and Sandy to address your questions. Joe? ","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Dominic. So let\u2019s move into the Q&A session. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Mike Weinstein ","Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Dominic Caruso","Yes.","Joseph Wolk","Yes, we can.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, hi Mike.","Mike Weinstein ","Perfect. Thanks, Dominic. So, Dominic, first item, I just want to clarify for people because it appears to be there is a fair amount of confusion out there. The margin that you reported this morning, the kind of headliner or unadjusted margins this morning, those \u2013 that doesn\u2019t back out the amortization cost and so those numbers that [Indiscernible] are not apples-to-apples, the ones you gave on your comments for more apples-to-apples for [Indiscernible] margins and operating margins, correct?","Dominic Caruso","When I am commenting on our results, I am doing so by excluding the special items, the most impactful \u2013 impact of amortization expense, just so we can have an apples-to-apples comparison because of the significant acquisitions we did this year, and that\u2019s right, Mike.","Mike Weinstein ","Okay, perfect. A couple items I wanted to be touched on, one was, can you give us an update on ZYTIGA? And what\u2019s happening from what you can see with the IPR decision and the trial? And then second, could you spend a minute on STELARA because if we look at the pharma outperformance this quarter, and impart to overall acceleration in pharma from first half to second half. ","One of the big stories is STELARA\u2019s acceleration over the last several months driven by the Crohn\u2019s launch. So can you talk a little bit about how that launch is going and maybe the outlook for STELARA going forward, because that\u2019s relative to consensus STELARA was the big outperformance this quarter. Thanks. ","Dominic Caruso","Mike, let me turn that question over to Joaquin who is here \u2013 as you know runs our Pharmaceutical business. So, Joaquin? ","Joaquin Duato","Hi, Mike and good morning to all of you. Before I go to STELARA let me give you a couple of [Indiscernible] reflections on how the quarter went. I think when we met in May 2017 on the occasion of the Pharmaceutical R&D review day, we anticipated that the performance of the Pharmaceutical group was going to accelerate during the second half of the year. And that\u2019s precisely what you are seeing today. ","You are seeing the pharmaceutical group moving from low single-digit growth in the first half of the year to 6.7% in this third quarter. So clear acceleration of the sales of the pharmaceutical group. That are driven by a number of factors, one is, the momentum that our key brands are gaining mainly driven by market share gains and one example of that that I will talk about this is STELARA as you mentioned had posted very impressive 43% gain in the U.S. in the quarter. ","The second is positive news on our pipeline. During this period, we have launched TREMFYA, which has been very well accepted by physicians. We have already 900 physicians prescribing TREMFYA about 3000 patients and as we speak TREMFYA, it\u2019s already leading in new to brand share when compared to the new therapies when compared to the anti-IL 17. ","And then the third one is that, we completed the acquisition of Actelion and we are now in our first 100 days post integration. You\u2019ve seen the results of Actelion there, very much aligned with the expectations, positive growth and share gains both in UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT. So the combination of these three factors is driving the 6.7% adjusted growth on the 14.6% of total pharmaceutical growth. ","This is very aligned on what we discuss in our pharmaceutical review day. When it comes to STELARA, I mean the growth is driven by two factors. First, share gains in the psoriasis market where STELARA is the leading brand in new to brand share in psoriasis and second, very impressive gains also in the Crohn\u2019s disease market where we continue to gain share. ","So the combination of our continuous growth and sustained growth in psoriasis plus the launch in Crohn\u2019s disease is driving this growth in STELARA that you are seeing today. ","Dominic Caruso","And Mike, with respect to the ZYTIGA patent, so I think as you are well aware there is two avenues that are being pursued there. The first was with respect to the court. So the New Jersey Court had set a preliminary trial date for October of this year. However during a status conference as recently as a few weeks ago in September, there is a schedule of pre-trial activity. ","So we don\u2019t anticipate that a new trial date will be set until early next year. With respect to the second avenue in the U.S. patent and trademark office, we have not yet received the decision. We understand it\u2019s the U.S. PTO\u2019s right and permission to extend deadlines on that. So we await, we\u2019re just like everyone else. ","Joseph Wolk","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS.","Matt Miksic ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. So one on pharma if I could just one follow-up on devices. So first, and I guess for Joaquin since we have you here, obviously very impressive results across core franchises excluding Actelion. ","I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on \u2013 Mike mentioned STELARA, but how some of the other pieces fit together over the next 12 months specifically new indications, line extensions for key drugs like XARELTO and Dara and some of the other recent filings like apalutamide and how they sort of fit together against the potential increase biosimilar pressure. ","And the reason I mentioned in the next 12 months is because that I think investors are interested in seeing how you\u2019ll maintain and extend those PAH Actelion franchise and fit these other pieces together and then sustain your growth going forward and then I had just one follow-up. ","Joaquin Duato","Thank you and thank you for the question and let me start with the drivers of the growth that we are having and we are seeing in the third quarter and in the second half of the year that you want to continue to see over the next year. Let me start with XARELTO that posted very impressive growth in this quarter of 20% mainly driven by share gains and that we believe will be sustained into next year. ","You remember that we already share the data of our COMPASS study, and we are planning to file these new indications by the end of the year and that will together with the existing share gains that we have in our markets drive the growth of XARELTO in 2018. XARELTO had the highest share gain in the quarter in the last four years mainly driven because we are starting to put a bigger dent on Warfarin. ","So that\u2019s an important driver for us moving forward. If we continue with oncology, both IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX continue to have impressive share gains. IMBRUVICA, as Joe commented has already 50% share across line of therapies and DARZALEX is getting share both in third line, second line multiple myeloma with around 20%, 40% respectively and we plan to file our first-line study, our RTM study by the end of the year. ","So that\u2019s going to be another positive driver moving into next year as we continue to gain share in different line of therapies. If you recall too this past quarter, we had the approval of the combination with Pomalyst in second line multiple myeloma. So, both IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX will remain important drivers of our growth into 2018. ","The other driver that sometimes goes unrecognized but is having an impact, that in the quarter posted 15% growth and we see that continue to gain share in the antipsychotic market as long-acting therapies remain relatively underutilized as compared to the potential of it. ","So those are going to be some of the most important drivers moving into 2018. Then, another two important updates on our pipeline. It\u2019s the filing of apalutamide that we just completed and that it\u2019s going to enable us to have - maybe seen that is going to have an indication in patients that have prostate cancer without metastases. ","It would be a very important new indication for apalutamide and great option for prostate cancers. We will continue to progress with TREMFYA in psoriasis and also in 2018, we are planning the filing of Esketamine, which we believe would be a very important option for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. So those are the drivers that will continue to enable our market growth in 2018.","Matt Miksic ","That\u2019s great. Thank you and then, if I could just couple things I think investors are curious about in devices, one, Joe or Dominic on the U.S. knee market, worldwide down obviously, there was some International pricing you mentioned, but any color on what you are seeing here in Q3 and then in Spine, the pressure you talked about portfolio gaps, anything being your position in the market as one of the leaders any comments you had on just the color of that market would be helpful? Thanks.","Joseph Wolk","Sure, Matt. So just a little bit of commentary on knees. It was a little bit softer than what we had experienced in recent quarters, but I would say it\u2019s not the 4% that was reported as down. You have some pricing issues, specifically in India with some legislation where we actually book the charges for three quarters, not just the one quarter since it was retroactive back to the beginning of the year. ","You also had some weather related impact albeit modest. So you are getting closer to a negative 1 to flat versus the minus 4 that reported maybe for some qualitative commentary with respect to knees and spine, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy.","Sandy Peterson","Hi, Matt. Thanks for your question. So, I\u2019d just \u2013 couple of general comments and then I\u2019ll specifically answer your questions about knees and spine in particular. As you know, I\u2019ve just recently in last few months taken over responsibility for medical devices and I think in the quarter you will see that we have some clear areas where we are doing very well like EP, wound closure, biosurgery and some parts of our orthopedics portfolio. ","But there is some places in the portfolio where the full impact of some of our new product launches and some of our acquisitions have not fully taken hold yet. And as I\u2019ve said to others before, we\u2019ve also spent a lot of time over the last quarter talking about how do we ensure commercial execution on the ground in a much more robust in some of these markets. ","And I think we are beginning to see the positive impact of that with a lot of our businesses and some account wins that will start having some positive impact for us as we kind of continue through the fourth quarter. And Joe\u2019s comments about knees are absolutely spot on. ","We also, I think, there is a little bit of the impact about elective surgeries in parts of the U.S. where we know a large percentage of the volume happens in that southeast part of the U.S. that clearly had some minor impact on the business also in the quarter. We also in Europe, which impacted our business, both our Spine and Knee business. ","We had a very unusual one-time impact on our ordering and distribution system that impacted about a week\u2019s worth of sales, particularly in orthopedics. So we are catching up from that but it clearly had an impact in both Spine and Knees in Europe as well as the U.S. And then, the last thing I would say is, our tibial tray, our cementless program as well as we have just completed our first atune revision case in the U.S, and we are still in the soft rollout of that. ","But that clearly is going to have a very positive impact on our knee business in particular in the U.S. but as it goes global outside of the U.S. we\u2019ll start seeing the positive impact of that on our knee business as we move forward. So I guess, I would characterize the quarter as a few one-off things that had an impact on the business but generally speaking, the platform is doing very well and we\u2019ll start gaining more momentum as we move forward. ","As it relates to our Spine business, we \u2013 if you break it apart and look at the performance overall, obviously we are not satisfied with the performance of that business. We have had portfolio gaps in that business for a while. We are starting to get through those and starting to launch some new things in the business. ","But if you look at the business from a regional standpoint, the Asian business and Latin America business had a good quarter and we have things work to do in the U.S. and North America. But you should start seeing some more positive momentum in our Spine business as we go into next year. And in general, I think Spine procedures have been down in the industry overall over the last couple of quarters and that clearly there is a macroeconomic impact on Spine. So, thank you, Matt.","Joseph Wolk","Great, next question please, Rob?","Operator","Your next question will be coming from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. One for Jorge, one for Dominic. So, on Consumer, obviously, everyone have seen the news that Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Health business. What\u2019s the implication if any for your consumer franchise and J&J has been reshaping its consumer portfolio in recent years? ","Are you interested in a large deal in Consumer? Do you prefer to continue to do smaller deals in your current category? As I said, I have one follow-up for Dominic.","Jorge Mesquita","So, good morning and thank you for your question. Well, as you know, we have a very disciplined and systemic approach to evaluating potential acquisitions and our focus primarily is always on value creation and that\u2019s the overriding criteria that we use to establish whether or not we have an interest in a particular asset. So, as assets become available, we systemically evaluate them, but our focus is always can we create value for Johnson & Johnson regardless of the scale of the asset. And Dominic?","Larry Biegelsen","Yes, I wanted to ask about, the puts and takes for 2018. I know you are not giving guidance until the Q4 call. But, anything on the top-line that you would call out versus 2017, but I am more curious about EPS and how we should be thinking about the incremental Actelion accretion in 2018. It\u2019s probably about an incremental $0.30 or so. And I am curious if that we should expect to see that on top of your normal 6% to 8% operational EPS growth or you will reinvest some of it? Thanks for taking the questions.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Larry, look I think, we\u2019ve previously described the first full year of accretion for Actelion to be $0.35 to $0.40 a share. We have said that this year\u2019s accretion is going to be about $0.07 a share. So, you are right, I mean, you get to a place that\u2019s just under $0.30 of potential additional EPS accretion from that acquisition. ","As we always do, we are evaluating all our plans right now in determining where is the best place to invest. What the businesses have in terms of launches of new products and what they have in terms of their own momentum and we want to continue to invest behind new product launches. So it\u2019s too early to give you an expectation of how much of the accretion from Actelion will fall through versus how much will be invested. ","But suffice it to say, we generally, as you know, grow our sales, we\u2019ve aimed to grow our sales faster than categories we compete in and we aim to grow our earnings at a rate faster than sales. So we will continue to do that and we will give you a clear picture of that as we set our plans for 2018 when we talk in January. ","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Larry. And the next question, Rob?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. ","Jeff Holford ","Hi, thanks for taking me very much. Just wonder if you can just give us a little bit more color on DARZALEX. I guess, unless you talk about in the U.S. so you have better information hopefully, just your market share in the lines of therapies that you are in and what kind of duration of therapy you think you are going to get to in those lines? Thanks very much. ","Joaquin Duato","Thank you. So, as far as DARZALEX, as I commented, our market share in third line plus is in north of 40% in the U.S. already and in second line, depending on the shortage, generally north of 20% and it continue to grow. Our \u2013 the trends that we are seeing in the market are very positive, particularly after the approval in one prior line and the data we presented in one prior line and also as I commented earlier, we already finished the study in first-line in combination with BMP and we are planning to file before the end of the year. ","So, all is positive on that side. Importantly, we are also working as you guys know, in developing a subcue formulation and we are going to start our phase 3 study with the subcue formulation this year. So, increasingly we see that DARZALEX becoming a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma and that\u2019s the feedback that we are getting from customers. ","Jeff Holford ","And then just one quick follow-up if I can on Actelion. I mean, Dominic, I think just talked couple of times about how accretion from this deal can be delivered pretty quickly. Just wondering, for 2018, do you think you will give us some kind of update on the level of accretion that really will drop through from this in 2018 and whether there is any potential upside to the $0.35 to $0.40 that you previously talked to? Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, Jeff, when we talk in January, we\u2019ll obviously point out the impacts of Actelion and actually all of our acquisitions on growth. So we\u2019ll give you an estimate of organic growth and therefore you will be able to see the impact of acquisitions and on the bottom-line, we\u2019ll talk about the impact it has to our overall earnings picture and also any major investments we plan to make.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Jeff. Next question please, Rob?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. ","David Lewis ","Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Maybe just, Jorge, starting with you, maybe a couple for Joaquin. Just, Jorge, just strategically since you got to the company, you really saw some very impressive improvements in the consumer franchise earlier last year and that has flowed in the near term. ","There are lot of strategic questions investors have about the impact of the Amazon on the broader consumer business, the impact of Millennials on brands. Other than just making some of the investments you\u2019ve talked about, is there a change in the strategic focus for this business for you based on some of these sort of macro pressures or is it just continuing to do that the prior plans, strategically how well do you think you are positioned now versus when you first joined J&J? ","Joaquin Duato","Thanks very much for the question, Dave and it\u2019s a very good one. I mean, there is no doubt that the broader CPG industry is seeing a change in the competitive landscape and there is a fundamental shift here enabled by digital technologies and we see the rise of a lot of small companies that are now competing with the large established companies in this field. But in the fate of it, I am very confident that our strategies are absolutely the right one for us to continue with what we\u2019ve had for a number of years which is a strong sustained run of market share growth. ","We have to make some adjustments in terms of the operational focus of those strategies. In particular, we have to drive accelerated growth on the online channel and we are doing just that. We are growing, we estimate at this point, at twice the rates of the broader online channel with our e-commerce capabilities. We are investing very heavily in leadership, in systems, in capabilities in general and for sales fundamentals online, so that we drive our share of e-commerce to match our offline share. ","So, there are some adjustments we are making, but overall, the broad strategic focus that we have had and that\u2019s driven our results for the last few years remains very much in place and we feel we are very well positioned. ","David Lewis ","Okay, very helpful and then Joaquin just two questions from me on pharma. First is, ZYTIGA\u2019s strength this quarter, how much does that have to do with the patient assistance programs disconnects me part of the year resolving and how should we think about that franchise growth going forward? ","And the second question is just talacotuzumab, you talked about this at the Analyst Day potential multi-billion dollar opportunity. Can you just give us a little more detail with this safety issue, efficacy issue and what\u2019s the future path going forward for talacotuzumab? Thanks so much.","Joaquin Duato","Thank you. Thank you for the question and ZYTIGA strength in \u2013 it\u2019s been mainly driven in the U.S. by the combination of market growth and share gains. So that\u2019s the reason we have had these ZYTIGA strength in the U.S. ","David Lewis ","Joaquin, just an \u2013 the Patient Assistance Foundation still hasn\u2019t anniversaried yet. Would you expect that in the fourth quarter? So that was actually about a four to five point headwind to growth in this quarter. Again, these are independent organizations, so it\u2019s hard to predict what may happen, but we didn\u2019t see the incremental lift from the sequential quarter from Q2, but it is still a significant comparator when you compare to last year\u2019s Q3. ","Joaquin Duato","So that\u2019s the source of the strength of ZYTIGA is the market is growing and also we continue to gain share and price overall including the effect of the third-party foundations continues to be a negative for ZYTIGA. What has been new recently is the presentation of the latitude data which was very well received by the customers and by patients with very significant results in increasing overall survival and radioactive progression free survival in patients that the - where metastatic but get hormone na\u00efve. ","So this is the first time that a medicine is tested in this indication and we are filing in this indication in the U.S. and in Europe and some other fact in Europe we received a positive opinion for the CHMP recently. So that is the major driver of ZYTIGA growth is higher market penetration combined with share gains across the port.","Regarding talacotuzumab, I mean, as Joe commented, we discontinued talacotuzumab based on recommendation of the IDMC in AML based on the safety risk benefit ratio and we are now evaluating that data and using those revenues to see which other indications we may pursue in the future. So it is still premature to comment on what else we would be doing with talacotuzumab.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, David. Next question please, Rob?","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bob Hopkins","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just one clarifying question and then one question for Sandy. First just to clarify, the impact on the hurricanes on the medical device growth is there was 30 basis points. Is that global or U.S. and it wasn\u2019t more pronounced in certain areas of hospital med tech versus others?","Dominic Caruso","I would say, Bob, the best way to classify that is a very preliminary analysis. We looked at some zip codes to see what particular metropolitan areas might have been hit that were indirect line of the storm. But it\u2019s mostly \u2013 it would be a U.S. phenomena obviously because it was related to surgery days and not anything to do with supply disruption.","Bob Hopkins","So, but the 30 basis point was the impact on worldwide hospital med tech growth?","Dominic Caruso","Correct.","Bob Hopkins","Not U.S., okay. And then, the bigger picture question for Sandy, just on the outlook for pricing in hospital med tech, because we\u2019ve been noticing that whether it\u2019s China or Australia or India, it just feels like governments in these countries are sort of taking a harder line around med tech pricing and it could be something that impacts growth going forward. So just curious to get your views on how big of a concern is this for you as you look at the hospital med tech business growth outlook outside the United States?","Sandy Peterson","So, thanks for the question. Our sense of it is, it\u2019s in some of these markets, it\u2019s an episodic thing that happens and it\u2019s not that unusual over time, but I think what we are also finding, I guess the punch line is we are concerned about it. ","But not terribly concerned about it because we have been able to go and work with many of these governments and hospital systems to find ways to provide incremental value to them beyond the physical product alone and that\u2019s a ways for us to actually be able to deal with some of these questions about pricing. ","Now, obviously, the situation in India, this one-time price impact on knees clearly has an impact on the marketplace in that regard and I think that\u2019s sort of a much more extreme example of what we\u2019ve seen in other marketplaces which were a lot more moderated and we have the opportunity in some cases to have broader conversations with them and it\u2019s part of why we have changed our business strategy to really show up as an integrated business talking to them about a number of different things beyond purely the physical product going forward. And so that\u2019s how we believe are going to address this question when it arises in OUS markets.","Joseph Wolk ","Hey, Bob, maybe just to pick up on that point for the benefit of those on the call. If you look at our price contribution to the enterprise results, it was actually about negative 2% and it was a slight positive price impact in consumer, slightly negative in medical devices and where we actually saw some price decline or price erosion it was about 3% in the Pharmaceutical sector and that translates to about 2% down for the entire enterprise. So it speaks to the strength of pharma that it really came from volume, market share related types of improvements. Rob next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Another question for Sandy. J&J has been reshaping its device portfolio for several years now selling diagnostic, selling cardio. I know you are strategically looking at diabetes. So I was hoping you give us an update beyond what you said on ANIMAS most recently. ","And then, as you look at the portfolio, and I know you've only been there a short time, but are there other areas when you analyze the portfolio that may be divested? And then as you look at the portfolio, are there areas that you see that that may be helped through M&A? So long question and then I have a follow-up on utilization in the U.S.? Thanks. ","Sandy Peterson","So, thanks, Glenn. So, I\u2019ll start with \u2013 you have seen the actions we have taken regarding our portfolio. But I think the most important thing is, all of the actions we\u2019ve taken to invest in the platforms that we believe have significant growth and we\u2019ve been doing this both in terms of acquisitions, strategic partnerships and investing in R&D. ","So if you look at our \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve made a significant bet in our neurovascular business where stroke is a huge unmet need and it\u2019s only growing. And so we now have a business due to some things we get internally as well as a couple of acquisitions in the last 12 months. So, you should see us over time build that business the way that we have built the EP business. ","So, it\u2019s an important growth driver for us as a company. Obviously, in our core orthopedics businesses, we have been making acquisitions, small tuck-in acquisitions plus investing in technology as well as innovation and you\u2019ll see us continue to drive that. The most obvious significant one in the last year is all of the investments we have been making in vision to broaden our portfolio in vision care. ","So we did three acquisitions this year to broaden the depth and breadth of our vision portfolio. So I think you should think about this as a combination of where do we see growth in the business. Whether it\u2019s in core surgery, whether it\u2019s in orthopedics, whether it\u2019s in vision care or what we call now interventional. You should expect to see us continuing to make those investments and over time, as we make choices about other parts of our portfolio, we\u2019ll let you know when we make those choices.","Glenn Novarro ","Okay. Anything on - no update on diabetes other than the announcement on anti mos, is that correct?","Sandy Peterson","Right.","Joseph Wolk ","The question was on utilization? ","Glenn Novarro ","Yes, yes, Joe. If I look at your U.S. surgery business, I look at your U.S. orthopedic business, it be coming lighter better than we expected and it looks like in the third quarter, there was a step-down slightly negative growth versus positive growth in the first half. So, I was wondering if you can provide commentary on what you are seeing in the U.S. with respect to utilization? ","Is there any impact from fewer sign-ups with ACA? Is there impact occurring because of high deductible plans being purchased? So, any color as to why we saw some weakness in either your business or utilization in the third quarter? Thank you.","Joseph Wolk ","What we are seeing in the line is, and again this is very preliminary for the third quarter but pretty much on par with hospital machines being down maybe 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Surgical procedures from our lens looks to be down about 2.5% and then lab procedures are remaining flat sequentially up about 2%. Thanks for the questions, Glenn. Next question please, Rob?","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just have a few quick ones for pharma. On INVOKANA, it looks like the quarter performance was a little weak. I want to get your perspective from the field. Now that it\u2019s been a few months since the Janus presentation ADA. How much of the sequential drop would you attribute to pricing? And what that looks like going forward? And then on apalutamide, I just want to get the J&J perspective on kind of the cost benefit, the profile have stacks against ZYTIGA. ","Obviously, down the road you\u2019ll be competing, it\u2019s a generic. So that\u2019s obviously a different sort of sales cycle on that. And then maybe a bigger picture on prostate. You guys have had good data and pre-metastatic has extended. Just want to get your perspective on the tipping point really for broader urologist adoption. Thanks guys.","Joaquin Duato","Thank you, and let me start with INVOKANA. INVOKANA first continues to be the leader in prescriptions in the ALD2 category. So it\u2019s still the leader in the SAT2 category. When it comes to this quarter, we show a decline, and the decline was mainly, mainly driven by price and also we saw a fair impact since we included the black box warning in our label. ","So it was a combination of mainly price and some share declines due to the black box warning. As we move forward, we see opportunities with INVOKANA. The first one is we just file our main indication based on the campus data and that\u2019s going to be important for us moving into 2018 and the second one we continue to progress with our CREDENCE study in patients with diabetic nephropathy in order to evaluate how their kidney function progresses. ","So those are two elements that make us confident of the future of INVOKANA moving into 2018. Regarding apalutamide, we are super excited of being able to continue our leadership in prostate cancer with apalutamide. I mean, it\u2019s been great that we have been able to file recently for this indication as you commented this is going to be the first time that these agents are indicating in patients that have no metastases. ","To your question of ZYTIGA, I think you are aware that in metastatic prostate cancer what we are analyzing it\u2019s a combination of apalutamide and ZYTIGA compared to ZYTIGA. So, that would be transformational if we are able to demonstrate that superiority. So that\u2019s how we see the market moving forward and as you are also aware we have alliances of with PARP inhibitor in the area of prostate cancer that we are studying now that we plan to file in this indication in 2018 that eventually we will combine with our androgen anti-androgen agents. ","So we\u2019ll have a full line of products in the area of prostate cancer from the non-metastatic to the metastatic indications combining apalutamide, ZYTIGA and eventually Niraparib. So we feel very confident about the options that we are bringing to those patients and also we feel very confident about how competitive our offering is, which is being demonstrated by the share gains that you have seen in this quarter and about our speed in being able to complete the apalutamide trials and file for that. ","Joseph Wolk ","Great. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Rob, next question please?","Operator","The next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. ","Jami Rubin ","Thank you. Joaquin, maybe you could just follow-up on the question related to INVOKANA. What are you seeing with the SGLT2 class? Are you losing share to Jardiance because of the amputation warning? And you talked about price, how should we think about this franchise going forward? INVOKANA was one of those drugs that had such a spectacular \u2013 now it\u2019s a negative territory down 20% this quarter. ","How should we think about the growth of this franchise going forward? Would you anticipate price continues to be a thorn or is this more of a step down and sort of a rebalancing or rebasing and would you expect to see the SGLT2 cloud start to pay some share? And then I have a couple follow-up questions for Dominic, thanks. ","Joaquin Duato","So, to your first question, yes, we are losing share to the other SGLT2 agents since we introduced the box warning in our label. We remain the leader of the category, but we are losing share, particularly in new patients. Certainly, the price has been even a bigger driver in the step decline that you have seen this quarter. ","Our belief in INVOKANA moving forward is based on the very positive data that we have submitted in MACE and the overall risk reduction that we see in utilizing INVOKANA and also in the study that we are conducting, the CREDENCE 1 in patients with diabetic nephropathy evaluating their renal function. So, overall, we see the SGLT2 category and INVOKANA bringing important benefits and we continue to see INVOKANA as an important brand for us moving into 2018. ","Jami Rubin ","Okay, thank you. And Dominic, just a couple P&L questions. I think you had said that currency has now swung from minus five to plus three, so that\u2019s an 8 percentage point benefit. So should we assume that most of the top-line and bottom-line guidance increases, not all but most \u2013 the majority is related to FX. ","And then secondly, on the net or on the other income line, that\u2019s a line that, I know you are going to give us guidance in 2018, but it\u2019s very hard for us to analyze, because it fluctuates so much depending on asset sales. I mean, going back in my model, this is a line item that was more in the sort of $500 million, $600 million range and now it\u2019s $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. ","There was a year when it was $2 billion. Can you just give us kind of a big picture view in terms of how we should think about this line going forward, because obviously it\u2019s become a driver to earnings? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Hi, Jami. So first of all, on the FX question, you are correct that the increase in our guidance is partly due to of course a different outlook on FX on both top and bottom-line. So I think that\u2019s an accurate assessment. With respect to other income, here is a good way to think about it. I mean, we have consistently talked about the fact that we intend to actively manage our portfolio as we\u2019ve been doing that over the last several years. ","And in doing that, we will make a determination whether the asset is better in our hands or better in someone else\u2019s hands, and once those decisions are made we do include in our overall guidance for the year our expectation on this other income line which is difficult for anyone to forecast. ","So, unless we can \u2013 and that\u2019s why we give you our expectation and you can see that we are pretty much in line with the expectation we gave you from the beginning of the year with respect to the asset sales that we think would occur this year and therefore be part of our overall expectation from the very beginning. We are executing on those. The way to think about this is, we don\u2019t expect that our work in evaluating the portfolio is going to diminish. ","We are going to continue to do that. We are going to make sure that assets are better either in our hands or in someone else\u2019s hands and when you look at the other income line in your model and you see it increase, please take also a look at pretax operating margin which is after COGS and SG&A and R&D, and you could see that that margin at the same time decreases which goes to the point that I made earlier that when we do this, it\u2019s a portfolio decision. ","So we are increasing our investment in R&D, SG&A et cetera, at the same time that we are recognizing these gains. So, they are not really drivers of earnings, they are really drivers of investments in the portfolio and so take a look at that and as I said earlier, we expect to complete this group of asset sales this year in our guidance. ","But I said earlier when we talked last quarter, that I would not expect that this line item would drop off significantly in 2018 and therefore that allows us to keep our investment levels up high going into 2018 as well. ","Joseph Wolk ","Thanks for the question, Jami. Rob, next question please?","Operator","The next question is coming from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning and thank you. I just had two quick questions for Joaquin. First, on this REMICADE the biosimilar readiness plan is installed as been effective, you\u2019ve been highly successful in contracting in 2017, but just wanted to get your input on if anything changes within the REMICADE defense strategy with a second biosimilar mark into 2018 in terms of continuing to secure wins with your innovative contracting model and I just have one follow-up.","Joaquin Duato","So, thank you for the question and important thing here is to understand the dynamics on the REMICADE and in the immunology biologics market overall. I mean, the key factor for REMICADE being successful is the fact that physicians and patients have a high confidence and trust in REMICADE based on more than 2 million patients treated and 16 indications. ","There is no other medicine as a study has experienced as REMICADE is. And the second factor which is important to recognize is that these medicines are not interchangeable and sometimes, this element is lost in the debate. These medicines are not designated as interchangeable by the FDA. So in other words, they are not like generics and they are not the same. ","They are biosimilars but not the same. So, having said that, what we are seeing in the marketplace that the physicians are very reluctant to switch stable patients for REMICADE into other medicines. And that is normal, I mean, because in many of the indications that REMICADE is used, particularly in the most frequent one in gastroenterology these biosimilars do not have any data to show for. ","So, the most important factor in the success of REMICADE is the physician and the patient experience and the body of data that supports using REMICADE on the lack of interchangeability. Now, we continue to compete vigorously in price and we continue to drive reductions of course for the overall system based on that. ","And as a matter of fact, the price of REMICADE has decreased year-over-year when you look at the net price. So, when we move into 2018, we are going to continue to work along the same lines of making sure that physicians have the option to continue to use REMICADE and making sure that they are aware of the body of data and the experience that they have had during the last years in which they have been able to have these therapeutic options. ","So that\u2019s really the base of our 2018 plan making sure that physicians have the option to prescribe REMICADE and making sure that patients that are stable that can benefit from REMICADE can remain in REMICADE. ","Josh Jennings","Thanks again. Just a quick one on XARELTO in the COMPASS trial. It\u2019s still early days post-data, but any preliminary thoughts on how to maximize capitalization on the coronary peripheral artery disease opportunities? Thanks a lot.","Joaquin Duato","Thank you for the question. I mean, as I said, XARELTO has had terrific share gains during this quarter. It\u2019s the highest share gain in the last four years and that, well we are very pleased with the COMPASS results has nothing to do with the COMPASS results because as you know, COMPASS population, the coronary and peripheral arterial vascular disease is a different one and XARELTO will be used in a different dose. ","So all you seeing in XARELTO today is driven by our existing indications particularly atrial fibrillation and VTE treatment and prophylaxis. So, moving into 2018, we are filing this year for the COMPASS data as I commented. So we see significant opportunities in COMPASS. It\u2019s a 6 to 7 million patients that can be treated \u2013 is the total population and we believe that the profile of XARELTO based on the data of the COMPASS trial is going to be extremely competitive and that\u2019s going to be one of the drivers. ","This is only one of the study that are included in our excluded program that contains multiple indications seeking the studies in congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, medically ill patients that would continue to drive the growth of XARELTO in 2018 and after 2018.","Joseph Wolk ","Thanks for the questions, Josh. Rob, it looks like we\u2019ve got time for one more question?","Operator","Yes, your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler","Yes, thanks very much. The immunology section for J&J has been a tremendous grower or even since you date back to the acquisition of Sinacore in the 1990s, but one of the things that you\u2019ve recently done is that you\u2019ve backed out sirukumab in RA. So I am curious outside of the products you have on the market today, is there anything to back fill into RA that you have in the portfolio? ","And number two within immunology, can you comment on how sirukumab has been received with payers? And if I may a third, in for IMBRUVICA for GVHD, Joaquin would you say that that\u2019s a large market opportunity for you and if so how large? Thanks very much.","Joaquin Duato","Okay, so, we \u2013 let\u2019s say, it\u2019s important for me to remind that when it comes to the discussion of sirukumab or talacotuzumab, those were setbacks but our outlook of continue to drive above market growth through 2021 remains more surely than before based on the growth of our existing brands and the progress that we have had with several key elements of our pipeline like TREMFYA, apalutamide, and Esketamine. ","So that's an important theme for me to remind. When it comes to immunology, we are the company with more assets in this category. We have four approved assets, REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA and TREMFYA. Are we disappointed with sirukumab? We are, because we stand behind sirukumab and the value it has as an anti IL-60. ","The additional data request that we were having the complete response letter would have delayed the introduction of sirukumab significantly and based on the competition that exists there with other anti IL-6, we thought the best thing for us is to focus on other priorities. I mean, TREMFYA, it\u2019s been very well received by physicians and by patients. ","As a matter of fact, as I commented, we already have 900 physicians prescribing TRMFYA in 3000 patients and as we speak it\u2019s the leading the new to brand share in psoriasis when you consider new therapies anti IL-17. What about the payers? Look, this is a very competitive market in this category and we feel confident that we will have appropriate access moving into 2018. ","We\u2019d be negotiating that access in this part of the year and when the formula is come for 2019 we feel good that patients that want to use TREMFYA, physicians that want to use TREMFYA will be able to use it and will be able to prescribe it. ","So overall, as we discuss, we see that even in immunology, even considering the erosion that we are going to have with REMICADE, we are going to continue to post positive growth in immunology based on the strength of STELARA and on the strength of TREMFYA moving forward.","Joseph Wolk ","Great. So that concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. Thanks to everyone for the questions and continued interest in Johnson & Johnson and apologies for those questions we weren\u2019t able to address today. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Dominic for some brief closing remarks.","Dominic Caruso","Well, thanks, Joe. And as I noted earlier, we are very, very pleased with our strong third quarter performance. And I am also glad you had the opportunity to hear directly from our business leaders, Sandy, Jorge and Joaquin who are doing a terrific job in leading our strong businesses and delivering very, very strong results. ","We owe our strong performance and therefore our thanks to the very talented colleagues we have around the world who continue to bring innovative solutions to patients and consumers.

You may begin,","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice-President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2016. Joining me on the call today is Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the second quarter for the corporation, and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2016 results to date, and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Next Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement, and update guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions.","We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today.

This slide acknowledges those relationships. Also to assist you with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter.","Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion, up 3.9% versus second quarter 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3%, and currency had a negative impact of 1.4%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.1% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.7%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 15.4% with approximately a third of the growth due to an inventory build that will reverse in the third quarter.","Asia-Pacific Africa grew 2.1% while Europe declined 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures. The most significant one being Cordis. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 7.9% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S., and 6.9% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 30 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4 billion, and earnings per share were $1.43 versus $1.61 a year ago. As a reference in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after tax amortization expense of $238 million and charges for after tax special items of $631 million. 2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after tax amortization expense of $230 million, and charges for after tax special items of $66 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.","Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.74, representing increases of 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share also grew 1.8%.","Now turning to the highlights for the first six months of 2016. Consolidated sales to customers were $36 billion, an increase of 2.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year to-date basis, sales grew 4.6% operationally, and currency had a negative impact of 2.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 7.4% worldwide, 9.3% in the U.S., and 5.4% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively.","Turning now to earnings, for the first six months of 2016, net earnings were $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.02. Adjusted net earnings were $9.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $3.47, up 5.3% and 6.1%, respectively versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 7.3%.","Turning now to business segment highlights for the second quarter of 2016, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2015, unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 1.5% with U.S. sales up 2.1% while outside the U.S. sales were up 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, 6.8% in the U.S. and 2% outside the U.S.","In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 120 basis points and 200 basis points respectively, with the most significant impact to women's health, baby care, and oral care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by skin care, OTC, and oral care. In skin care, market share increases in a growing market as well as timing of inventory builds drove double-digit growth for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO.","OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak allergy season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic and digestive health share growth. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 47%, up from nearly 44% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of anti-smoking aids, children's analgesics, and digestive health products. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in oral care.","Moving now to our Pharmaceuticals segment, worldwide sales of $8.7 billion increased 9.7%, with U.S. sales up 13.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products.","Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide, U.S., and outside the U.S. was 12.8%, 13.9%, and 11.2% respectively. As you know, there are discounts and rebates in the pharmaceutical industry that are reflected in net sales. These amounts are estimated until the related claims data is received and then they are actualized. We have adjusted our estimates to reflect the most current claims trends.","U.S. Pharmaceutical results this quarter included a positive adjustment to sales reserves across many channels, which was approximately $140 million higher than the adjustment in the second quarter of 2015, and positively impacted second quarter 2016 worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points and U.S. growth by approximately 2.5 points.","On a product basis, REMICADE U.S. growth in the second quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by approximately eight points, STELARA by 11 points, SIMPONI by 13 points, ZYTIGA by eight points, and PROCRIT by 31 points. Significant contributors to growth were: immunology products REMICADE, STELARA, and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular metabolic products XARELTO and INVOKANA.","Within neuroscience, strong growth for INVEGA SUSTENNA TRINZA was partially offset by lower sales of INVEGA due to the impact of generic competition. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, share growth for STELARA and SIMPONI ARIA, as well as the gross-to-net adjustments to U.S. sales that I mentioned. The decline in REMICADE export sales to our distribution partners was due to the impact of biosimilars.","Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals, and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 70 countries.","DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake with strong underlying demand. DARZALEX contributed approximately two points to the U.S. Pharmaceutical growth rate. DARZALEX received European Commission conditional approval this quarter and was launched in certain European countries.","XARELTO sales were up 25.8% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to nearly 17%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was over 14% and in cardiology over 23%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed, with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest copay for a branded product.","INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET sales were up 21% on a worldwide basis and 15.2% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin was 6.3%, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was approximately 11.5% and over 5.5% in primary care. INVOKANA access remains strong at nearly 70% preferred for commercial and over 90% for Medicare Part D.","I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 1.8%. U.S. sales increased 1% while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, with the U.S. up 1.9% and growth of 5.8% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points and 50 basis points respectively.","Growth was driven by Advanced Surgery, Electrophysiology, Orthopedics, and Vision Care. Strong results were achieved for Advanced Surgery products with endocutters growth of 13%, energy growth of 9%, and biosurgicals growth of 8%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical also contributed to growth this quarter.","Electrophysiology grew 18% worldwide due to strong market growth complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. Orthopedics sales growth was driven by U.S. trauma and worldwide hips and knees. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products.","The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platforms in hips, and ORTHOVISC\/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to the results.","Orthopedics sales outside the U.S. negatively impacted results in China due to continued reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine other were the categories most impacted. In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter.","Vision Care sales were driven by strong growth across the major regions, partially offset in the U.S. by a customer reward program.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2016. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today.","As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016. And we're pleased that our shareholders are seeing above-average returns on their investment in Johnson & Johnson. Delivering a fair return to shareholders is the final line of our credo, which clearly defines our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers, and all others who use our products. When we meet those responsibilities and when we continuously work to improve outcomes for patients around the world, we succeed with all of our stakeholders.","Now over the last 130 years, the people of Johnson & Johnson have been helping people everywhere live longer, healthier, and happier lives. With that remarkable heritage, I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunities for the future of Johnson & Johnson and committed to continuing our long-term success. With our broad base of strong businesses, focus strategies, and comprehensive approach to innovation, we're well prepared to address the challenges of today's healthcare market and well positioned to lead in the movement towards healthier societies.","As I've discussed before, we believe our broad base in human healthcare is vital to achieving that vision. Our broad base is a strategic choice based on performance, and it has helped us to deliver strong, consistent, and sustainable financial performance through various economic cycles, meeting our financial commitments in the midst of global events like the UK's vote to exit from the EU or the economic issues in Venezuela this year.","Our broad base enables us to create and access growth opportunities wherever they may arise at the right time and in the right markets. Our deep healthcare expertise also makes Johnson & Johnson companies strategic partners of choice for many companies, whether that means with innovative startups, information technology giants, or large hospital systems looking to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care.","We also work with local governments and public health organizations, where we're collaborating more than ever to address the world's most pressing health challenges. Our broad base allows us to create product platforms and systems across categories and establish new sources of innovation through convergent combination products. And finally, our broad base is helping us to realize advantages of scale to achieve enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our segments.","All of these advantages of our broad base in human healthcare contribute to the long-term value we are able to create for our shareholders. And we continue to have a clear set of objectives for creating that long-term value. We expect global healthcare to grow at 3% to 5% over the next five years, and we have an objective to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market.","We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. When we combine these objectives with our plans of continue creating value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships as well as our strong dividend yield, we believe the result to be a basis for compelling, long-term total shareholder returns. And that is our focus. We invest for the long-term success of our business.","In fact, we have increased our spending on R&D every year for the last five years. We invest above industry average levels to build our robust pipelines and continue to nurture the investments we've already made. We also invest in innovative sales and marketing initiatives and consistently benchmark to ensure the return on our investments is as competitive and as efficient as possible. I'm proud that we are able to make these important investments in our business while also generating enterprise-adjusted net income margins that have increased in our above-industry benchmarks.","After we've made the appropriate investments in our business, we look to capitalize on the right opportunities to create greater long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation framework starts with paying dividends to our shareholders, which is why we have increased our dividend every year for the last 54 years. Next, we seek value-creating strategic acquisitions and partnership opportunities. And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as repurchase programs.","In fact, over the last three-year, 10-year, and 20-year periods, Johnson & Johnson total shareholder return has exceeded our competitive composite. And as you can see in this chart, we're off to a very strong start in 2016 with total shareholder return of approximately 20% through the first half of the year. And while we manage our business for the long term, we also have a number of near-term priorities which I've shared with you before. As an enterprise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments.","Through the first six months, we generated sales of $36 billion, resulting in an operational growth of 4.6%. When you exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C sales and operations in Venezuela, underlying growth was 7.9%. Through the first half of this year, we have delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.47. On an operational basis, adjusted EPS was $3.51, representing growth of 7.3%. In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver very strong results. On the same underlying basis, growth was 12.7% through the first half of 2016, and we are continuing to build momentum in our Consumer and Medical Device businesses, with first half underlying growth of 4.5% and 3.7% respectively.","We also continue making progress with our quality system, including resolving a warning letter in our ASP business in completion of the Synthes corporate integrity agreement. In Pharmaceuticals, we're continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In the last several months, we have made significant advancements in our pipeline, including: conditional EU approval for DARZALEX for monotherapy of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and presented positive Phase III data on the CASTOR and POLLUX studies, which are evaluating combination therapies for DARZALEX.","We also received EU approval for front-line IMBRUVICA treatment in CLL as well as FDA expansion of the IMBRUVICA label to include new Phase III data on survival and in combination therapies. Phase III data on STELARA demonstrated maintain clinical remission after one year of treatment in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Clinical trial and real-world data was presented on INVOKANA, including Phase II data on Type 1 diabetes and chronic weight management.","We received EU approval for TREVICTA, a once-every-three-months injection for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia as well as line extension approval for both INVOKAMET and SIMPONI. Positive Phase III data was presented on sirukumab for patients with moderately to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. And just recently, FDA granted a fourth breakthrough therapy designation for IMBRUVICA in graft-versus-host disease, GVHD, which makes six total breakthrough designations for our Pharmaceutical business so far.","In addition to these pipeline milestones, as Louise pointed out, we also delivered strong growth with our in-market products, including IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, XARELTO, STELARA and SIMPONI.","In Consumer, our priority is expanding market leadership in key segments within OTC, oral care, baby and beauty. As part of our focus on the beauty space, we have just completed the strategic acquisition of Vogue International. The award-winning beauty products in this portfolio, including the OGX brand, enhance our existing position in the market and are highly complementary to our heritage of breakthrough innovations in this space.","Vogue International has grown at double-digits over the last five years with a compound annual growth rate of about 25%, and the acquisition will take us from number eight to number four in the U.S. hair care market. And as we discussed in May at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to see operating margin improvement in our Consumer business and plan to continue that trend for the next several years.","And in Medical Devices, we're focused on accelerating growth through innovation and transforming our go-to-market models. In this segment, we're gaining momentum and accelerating growth through our unique and broad-based approach to innovation. Our performance this quarter was roughly in-line with market growth, and we're pleased with the progress here, but far from satisfied.","Our goal, to be clear, is to grow above market overall. And while we're making strategic decisions in our portfolio to achieve that growth, like the recent acquisition of BioMedical Enterprises, Inc., which filled a key portfolio gap in elective foot and ankle surgery, we're also realigning our commercial models in-line with our near-term priority.","Our innovation model in Hospital Medical Devices includes innovating our product offerings, but it also looks at innovation in terms of our commercial offerings and contracting. As we outlined during our Business Review Day, today about 25% of our U.S. orthopedic and surgery business is in multi-product line agreements. These agreements perform almost two times better than single product contract agreements. We see this percentage growing to 40% in the near future, which we believe will help us accelerate our business going forward.","And finally, we're also serving customers in a more end-to-end manner with risk-sharing contracts and outcome-based patient solutions. We're also on track to deliver approximately $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings from our Medical Device restructuring, the majority of which we expect will be realized by the end of 2018.","And also, we continue to make progress in launching new competitive entries in our Consumer Medical Device businesses like the ACUVUE VITA, a 30-day daily wear contact lens that provides superior comfort over leading monthly brands.","With all of this progress in our Medical Devices segment, we are confident that we are poised to deliver above-market growth. Altogether, these near-term priorities will help drive success for each of our business segments while also enabling us to achieve the growth we expect for our company in the long-term.","With the progress we've made on our near-term priorities, our businesses are strong, positioning us for above-market growth. With the combined strength of our end market portfolio, deep late-stage pipeline, and robust early-stage pipeline, we feel confident our Pharmaceutical business can successfully navigate through the launches of new competitive biosimilar or generic entrants and evolving market dynamics, and our objective is to continue delivering above-industry growth.","Our Consumer business is positioned to grow above-market while also achieving benchmark profitability and investing for the future. And in Hospital Medical Devices, we are poised to grow above the market driven by our innovative pipelines, expanding global presence and novel commercial models.","Our Consumer Medical Device businesses are holding leading positions and seeking opportunities to expand in large, growing markets with significant unmet needs.","With the strength of each of our business segments, we feel optimistic about the future opportunities in healthcare and we are confident our long-term strategies have positioned us for continued growth. Our holistic approach to innovation going beyond products and solutions will allow us to address the evolving healthcare landscape, driving better outcomes and delivering long-term value. We have the right internal capabilities and are developing strategic partnerships in health tech to reshape the way healthcare is delivered, managed and experienced.","And finally, our broad base across human healthcare uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice in the healthcare market. But perhaps most importantly of all, our continued strong performance means we are able to create better products, more valuable services and improve outcomes for patients, consumers and their families.","So I'd like to thank you. I look forward to further dialog during the Q&A session. But first, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Louise Mehrotra, who as most of you know from our announcement last month, has decided to retire after more than 35 years with Johnson & Johnson and more than 10 years as Vice President of Investor Relations. I know many of you on the call today have gotten to know Louise pretty well over the last several years, a real testament to the strong relationship she's built in the investment community on behalf of Johnson & Johnson, and you may know that she is an incredibly committed credo-based leader who has had a remarkable career and impact on our company.","I think I can speak for all of us at Johnson & Johnson in saying that we will miss her trusted, experienced, respected advice and her ever-present determination to do what is in the best interest of all of Our Credo stakeholders. Louise, we're so proud of the best-in-class investor relations function you've developed for us over the last decade, and we sincerely thank you for your many years of service and dedication to Johnson & Johnson.","Now we know we'll all be in good hands with Joe Wolk, previously Vice President of Group Finance for our Pharmaceuticals Group will become Vice President, Investor Relations effective August 1, and transition with Louise over the next five months. We are confident that Joe will continue Louise's legacy of transparent, incredible communication with you, our investors.","So now I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso who will talk more about our results and expectations for the second half of 2016. Dominic?","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone.","Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chief Financial Officer. Over the last 10 years, Louise and the entire IR team has transformed our Investor Relations function, significantly developing our reputation with the investment community which has been recognized with several awards and recognitions, including those from Institutional Investor and IR Magazine.","And through surveys of money managers conducted by Barron's magazine, Johnson & Johnson has been ranked at or near the top of the most respected companies list for 10 of the last 12 years. In fact, I'm also pleased to report that Johnson & Johnson was recognized this year by Barron's magazine as the number one most respected company for 2016. As Alex noted, Louise's outstanding leadership and dedication to advancing our reputation will continue with her successor, Joe Wolk, who we are happy to have joining us on our call next quarter. We all wish Louise well, and we are certainly going to miss her.","With that, I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're very pleased with our second quarter results, as we continue to see improved performance across the enterprise. And as Alex said, we remain confident in the strength of our business. As we previously discussed, in 2015 our underlying operational sales growth which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days in 2015 was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continued to deliver strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7.9% for the second quarter and our sales results are above analyst estimates. Our second quarter earnings were also above analyst estimates, driven by strong sales performance and operating margin improvement.","As you may remember, for 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase in pre-tax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We were pleased to see progress towards this improvement during the second quarter, which I will discuss later, and we remain comfortable with that forecast as we continue to accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business, and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year.","Now, I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 5.3% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales and also the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, it was strong at more than 8%.","If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $900 million on an after tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: intangible asset, asset amortization expense of about $200 million, litigation charges from ongoing legal matters of about $500 million, and additional charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring.","Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.74, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 1.8% versus the prior year. And adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year.","Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 120 basis points, mostly due to favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by transactional currency. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 28% of sales, or 230 basis points lower as compared to the second quarter 2015 due to good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, and higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines.","Our pre-tax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32.5% or 320 basis points higher than the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pre-tax operating margin is defined as gross profit, less selling, marketing, and administrative, and R&D expenses. As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progress throughout the year, and through six months we've achieved 180 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability.","Interest expense, net of interest income, was slightly lower than last year due to slightly better rates in our investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of approximately $600 million in the quarter, compared to a net gain of approximately $900 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $100 million compared to a net gain of approximately $1 billion in the prior year period. The significant decrease is due to the divestiture of NUCYNTA in the prior-year period.","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 23% in the same period last year. This year's effective tax rate reflects the R&D credit, which was passed by Congress late last year. The current mix of our business and the impact of new accounting standards related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which I will discuss further in a moment.","Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise declined by 250 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. During the second quarter 2015, as I mentioned earlier, we recorded a gain from the divestiture of NUCYNTA. And this gain, which as you know from our discussions last year, was invested in various parts of the business, but those investments occurred later in the year. If the NUCYNTA divestiture gain is excluded, year-on-year adjusted income before tax margin would show an improvement of approximately 300 basis points. We're very pleased to see a significant improvement in our Consumer business adjusted income tax margin this quarter.","As you may recall from our Business Review Day in May, we said that we are focused on improving our margins in the Consumer business to benchmark levels. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. Overall, we expect income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in the pre-tax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $16 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $26 billion of debt. As you know, in May we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates with a European debt issuance equivalent to $4.5 billion. Through the end of the second quarter, we've completed nearly 50% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we continue to expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments, prior development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, a lower range than our previous guidance, related to the timing of underlying activity. This impact will be offset by the strength of our business, primarily due to our outlook for a higher level of sales, as noted in the increased sales guidance in our press release today.","And now just a word on taxes, during the second quarter, the company elected for early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. With this update, increased tax benefits are recognized in earnings when the employee exercises options or receives shares. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded in equity.","The first quarter impact was approximately $165 million or $0.05 per share, and is reflected in the year-to-date results and not in the second quarter when we adopted the standard. The second quarter impact is offset by additional tax costs reflected in this quarter. For adoption guidance, the first quarter does not need to be reissued. However, all future comparisons for the first quarter should reflect the recasted numbers. We have included a supplementary schedule on our website that includes the updated first quarter impact for the P&L.","You will note that the first quarter recast number reflects a tax rate of 15.8%. The company issues shares related to employee stock compensation such as restricted stock awards or performance share units in the first quarter. Therefore, historically, a significant portion of the annual tax benefit is recognized in the first quarter. The tax benefit for stock options is recognized throughout the year as employees exercise their options, so timing is less predictable for stock options.","We are comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items of approximately 18.5% to 19%, lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the accounting for share-based compensation tax benefits that I just described.","Now, turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrants for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. And our assumption remains unchanged with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, or INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo.","As Alex mentioned, we have now closed the acquisition of Vogue International, so our guidance now reflects six months of additional sales. This is a fast-growing business and will contribute to the profitability of our Consumer business beginning the first full year, as well as be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in the first full year.","Also during the second quarter, we closed on our divestiture for the controlled substance raw material and API business, and therefore those sales will no longer be recorded. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this does provide a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","As noted in our press release, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for 2016, primarily reflecting the strong results from the first half as well as six additional months of sales from the Vogue acquisition, partially offset by the divestiture of our controlled substance raw material and API business. We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion and higher than our previous guidance.","Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016 excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and hepatitis C sales would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we've mentioned earlier.","Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1% on sales. This is consistent with our previous guidance, as other major currencies strengthened since our last update. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely, as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year.","Of course, we're closely following the situation with the UK's vote to exit from the EU. We expect this will take time to fully determine what the impact will be, if any. To put it into perspective, though, the UK represents about 3% of our total sales. So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect a change in the range of 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion and higher than our previous guidance.","And now, turning to earnings, as a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by about 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.66 to $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of 7.4% to 9%. This is a narrower range as well as higher than our previous guidance and includes the first quarter impact from the tax accounting change we discussed earlier.","If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, and this is consistent with our guidance in April. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.63 to $6.73 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance, due both to the continued strength of the business and a lower tax rate. And at this point in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.","In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the first six months of this year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year. Namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, or higher than we saw in 2015 on a comparable basis. Our adjusted pre-tax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year.","Our adjusted operational EPS growth in our guidance improved and remains strong, in the range of $6.66 to $6.76 a share. That's a growth rate of between 7% and 9%. Our businesses are continuing to invest while over-delivering on our growth expectations.","And now, I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Dominic. Michelle, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you and good morning, everybody. Dominic, just a couple items that we can hopefully get you to clarify. So number one is, what's the impact for the full-year EPS of ASU 2016-109 adoption? The tax rate coming down as it did suggests a range of anywhere from $0.04 to $0.12. Maybe you can help with that.","And then second, can you just walk through the net impact of the Vogue acquisition and then the API business divestiture on sales and earnings? Thanks.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Mike. With respect to the early adoption, I mentioned earlier that the first quarter impact was $0.05, and that's the most significant impact we expect for the year because that's where the majority of stock-based compensation is issued to employees. The second quarter impact was lower than that, but was almost entirely offset by other tax items. And the rest of the year will depend on when employees exercise stock options, so very difficult to predict. So for now, we've included in our effective tax rate for the year only the first quarter impact, which after we adopted in the second quarter, we're letting the first quarter impact flow through for the remainder of the year. Second quarter impact has already been offset by other items. And remaining quarterly impacts we think will either likely be offset by other items or very difficult to predict because it's timing of when employees exercise options. With respect to...","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So you're up \u2013 so your updated guidance, Dominic, doesn't assume any benefit in the second half of the year?","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Right, that's right. Only the first quarter flow-through that we experienced. And as I said, that's the largest single quarter of any stock-based compensation tax benefit.","Sales with respect to Vogue and the API business, Vogue for the full year is in a $350 million range, so we have about half a year of sales added to our guidance. And the API business was an annual business of about $250 million, and we'll have half a year of those sales no longer included in our guidance. So that's part of the increase in our overall growth in sales of about 0.5 point. The rest of it is due to the underlying strength we saw in the first six months.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the Pharma business, can I get you just to comment on a couple of items? So one, this is obviously a very important quarter for DARZALEX with the data we saw at ASCO and EHA. And just would love to get some high-level commentary on where you think that gets positioned going forward in multiple myeloma? And then, second, would you talk about the competitiveness of sirukumab, given the Phase three data we just saw at EULAR and your expectations there on filing, timing, and approval?","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Let me say a few words on both and then, Alex, why don't you add a few and, Louise, also on the timing question. So DARZALEX, we're very pleased with the initial uptake of DARZALEX. The product is well received by the medical community. And the data, as you pointed out, continues to be very impressive. And we believe DARZALEX can be essentially backbone therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. So we expect that we'll get additional indications for DARZALEX. But it's already been quite well received by the investment community, having great results for patients and, as I said, likely to be backbone therapy, going forward.","Sirukumab, also very positive data there. It's an important product in our autoimmune franchise. And, Alex, maybe you can comment a little bit more on that. And, Louise, on the timing of filing for sirukumab, I just don't have it handy, if you could give us that...","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","2016.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","2016, so we'll file this year for sirukumab.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mike, Alex here. Look, we're excited about sirukumab on a number of fronts, first as an IL-6. We know in this category there's a lot of interpatient variability. And having another option for patients, and based upon the early data that we have seen in RA, some of that presented just recently at the EULAR conference, we're very encouraged by. We're going to be looking at it, obviously, in other areas. And I think what we're most enthusiastic about is, if you combine sirukumab along with the work that we're doing with guselkumab as well, the IL-23 being looked at in psoriasis, it's really going to help us build out an even stronger portfolio and platform in immunology as we go forward over the next several","years.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Alex.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please, proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Larry.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And, Louise, congratulations on your retirement. I know you'll be missed. So one for Dominic, financials to start off with and then just one market-related question. So Dominic, just on the guidance, two clarification questions. So the $0.10 raise at the lower end on operational EPS and the $0.05 on the high end, is $0.05 due to the accounting change and the rest due to the underlying strength in the business? And then, it appears there's a lot of moving parts on the sales guidance as well. That 5.5% in 2015 that you raised to 6% for 2016, by my math, it implies that you're expecting a similar growth in the second half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2016, if one adjusts for the extra week in the year-ago period. So is that directionally accurate? Thanks.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Larry. Well, with respect to EPS guidance, you mentioned two of the items, which obviously was tax as well as the stronger sales performance. But I just wanted to remind you that we also lowered our other income and expense guidance for the year. So one way to think about it is that other income and expense guidance is lower, the tax rate is also lower, those two generally offset. And the midpoint of the guidance is up about $0.07, when I do the midpoint versus the two ends, and the $0.07 is primarily due to the overall increase in sales guidance that we provided today.","Your observations with respect to the back-half of the year, you're right that if we exclude the extra shipping days in 2015 from the analysis, the back-half of 2016 would be similar to what we saw for the first half.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And then, just on the market. In the U.S., maybe, Alex, if you could comment a little bit, or Dominic, on what you're seeing on procedure volume in the U.S. in ortho and, more broadly, in med tech, that would be great. Thank you.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Larry, we are seeing a pickup in terms of hospital admissions and surgical procedures. I think hospital admissions are up around 3%. We think the procedures are probably up around 3.5%. We continue to see some decrease overall in office physician visits, down 2%. And we think that that's just due to a more moderated utilization at the front-end due to increased co-pays and a number of other dynamics. But overall, if we look at the core growth rate in the medical hospital device area, we're encouraged by some of the recent trends that we're seeing.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And I'll echo Louise, we'll definitely be missing you, but congratulations. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about just on the capital allocation side. Obviously we saw Vogue. Is that what we should be thinking going forward in terms of the type of acquisitions to look forward to smaller, more like a tuck-in for you guys in that range?","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Kristen. Thanks a lot for the question, and I couldn't agree with you more regarding Louise. But look, we were really happy that we were able to add Vogue to the J&J Consumer portfolio. As we've been talking about over the last several years, we felt that what was most important in the Consumer group was to actually ensure that we were able to get through the early stages of the remediation in a really high quality and effective way. And I think the team has done a great job at making it a little bit more broadly across that entire Consumer group. I think we see that in the core trends.","And of course once we establish that, we continue to see Consumer as a great growth opportunity for the organization going forward. And, as Jorge and \u2013 as you saw when we did the Medical Device and Consumer Investor Relations Review now about a little over a month ago, I think they've got a really ambitious but also realistic plan for that, built on our existing brands.","And we are really pleased to see performance, for example, LISTERINE up 7%, OTCs up 6%, analgesics within OTCs were up over 13%. And then in beauty, you saw about a 9% lift with really strong performance from NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. And when you take that and augment it, I think with thoughtful additions such as we saw over this last quarter, whether it was NeoStrata, whether it was H\u00cdPOGLOS or with Vogue, we think that those are great additions to our existing portfolio and will likely be part of a continuous stream of additions to that part of the portfolio.","And as we said for some time, whenever we're looking at inorganic growth opportunities, we look at, tuck-ins, we look at mid-size deals. We'll look at large deals. Of course, the tuck-in strategy, particularly in Pharma \u2013 actually in all of our segments, Medical Device and Consumer, are those that, where we feel that we can create the most value. But we do think that there's other opportunities to create value as well in, again, in mid and larger deals. But we're going to be very disciplined. We're going to be very decisive about how we do it, and ultimately try to better serve patients and consumers.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just I guess on a broader note, I guess now that Consumer has turned the corner and has done well with the remediations, is that now a platform that, as you said, is more ready for acquisitions? I know Medical Devices is in the midst of their restructuring. Is that how we should think about it? And I have a follow-up for Dominic.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Look, we believe that, mission one was really focusing on the core business as we said. And I do feel that Consumer like all of our businesses we're pleased. We're never completely satisfied. And they made a lot of progress on the core, and so we would expect, again, in a very thoughtful, disciplined way to continue to do additions when we think they're right. But we would look for the same thing in our other segments, as well.","And by the way, we're pleased with the progress that we've seen in our Medical Device group over the last quarter as well. I mean, if we look at the restructuring, I think overall that team is on track. They're doing actions to strengthen their go-to-market model to accelerate their pace of innovation. They're prioritizing some additional platforms and geographies and all while streamlining some operations but really keeping very high quality standards. We think they're on track with a plan that they articulated earlier in the year and we're confident that as they move through this, they will be not only a stronger but a more innovative and a more efficient business.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And, Dominic, for the rebate from pharma, should we think about that as flowing through this quarter, or was that mainly reinvested? Because I know there was a higher rate of R&D this quarter?","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, the way to think about it maybe, Kristen, is that it's a year-over-year change in about $140 million sales level. So obviously some of that drops through to bottom line, and you're right, we do also take the opportunity to invest. Investments in R&D really are related to progress in the pipeline regardless of whether these gross-to-net adjustments would be available. But another way to think about it is that we're now at a point where these actualizations of prior estimates, our current reserves are \u2013 a significant portion of them are current because data has been coming in recently. So I wouldn't expect similar type of adjustments going forward.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks very much, and again, Louise, congratulations.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Matt.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Matt.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks to everybody for taking the questions. A lot of folks on the call. I'll try to keep it to one and one follow-up. Alex, while we've got you here, just one strategic question. And I don't know if this is consistent with what you're seeing or where you think things are going, but on Devices, what we've seen is a lot of these new innovations in structural heart in particular, some of the bundled payment initiatives seem to be driving more volumes to sort of higher volume centers, larger networks, potentially augmented by outpatient centers.","It's early in some of these initiatives, but that seems to be directionally where things are headed. And first, love to get your sense as to whether you think that's where things are going as well? And if so, how J&J is positioned on the Device side to better support these kinds of trends. And then I had one follow-up.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Matt. Thank you very much for the question. Over the past three years or four years, I think we've been pretty consistent in our thinking and in our projections about the likely increase in consolidation among providers and hospitals, particularly here in the United States, and just broader healthcare systems. And as systems feel continuing pricing pressure, we think that will manifest itself by them having consolidation. I think we've seen those trends. And I think they're clearly starting an effort to try and be as effective and as efficient as possible.","So we do believe that that will be a longer secular trend that's going to continue. That's why we believe having a diverse and enough critical mass in our Medical Device portfolio is so important going forward. We see it in the way that expectations are changing among decision makers, including not only surgeons but also people in procurement and other C-suite executives and administrators in hospital systems. And we think as a result of that, we'll be very well-positioned. Particularly when you think about our Surgical franchise, our Orthopedics franchise.","We've also been consistently saying that we're extremely pleased with the performance of our Cardiovascular unit, particularly our EP Group, Biosense Webster. I mean, once again this quarter they delivered over 18.5% growth with great innovation and great execution. But we also realize that that's an area where we'll continue to look for the right kind of additions, organically and inorganically, to ensure that we're properly positioned going forward.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you. And then on another topic that we spent a lot of time on I guess over the past year and we're now a quarter away from what looks like the competitive launch in the U.S., biosimilar side on REMICADE. Without asking you to tip your hand, of course, \u2013 I'd love to get a sense as to, can you \u2013 are there steps you can take \u2013 given your portfolio and your relationship with these payers and networks, are there steps you can take to sort of stop \u2013 I don't know what the right word is \u2013 potentially offset some of the potential impact or get ahead of some of the potential impact through some of the contracts that you're talking with these folks about? And I think you know the question I'm asking, and I'm sure you're not going to get into a ton of detail. But any color would be helpful as to the extent your ability to contract around that event.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Matt. Look, as we look at the landscape going forward, we fully predict that generics in biosimilars are going to be part of the competitive landscape. And look, we think that that is essential for the healthcare system. We think in the long run, it's actually a benefit for very innovative-focused companies because that's the only way you can relieve pressure over the long term. Of course, that's predicated upon the market and companies respecting intellectual property. It's very important to produce the right scientific information, so that we're guaranteeing patient safety and understanding the important clinical differences between some of these compounds, as they may or may not manifest themselves.","And so we projected them. As we look at our strategic plan, we think they will be there. But we also feel that's why it's so important to keep innovating with new product launches going forward. And it's also critical to establish a strong critical mass in terms of products but also expertise and clinical data and information in certain platforms. And so for us in the immunology platform, we're very proud of the extensive track record that REMICADE, the TNF-alpha compound has had, and what it continues to do. We'll continue to defend our intellectual property around it.","But at the same time if you look at compounds like STELARA and SIMPONI; not only have they both generated in excess of 30% growth this quarter, but we've also produced additional data that we think is going to be very important to patients and physicians in how they adopt these products. And these are already multi-billion-dollar platforms for Janssen and Johnson & Johnson. And then when you compound that with sirukumab and guselkumab again an IL-6 and IL-23 approach where we know there's a lot of patient variability, we think that's important.","Also as we look at REMICADE itself, we know that there's about 2.4 million patients who've been treated with the compound. We know that about 70% of them in fact are getting good relief and good effects. We know that they're unlikely to be switched when they're getting a positive response from the therapy. And we also know that when we contract across the Janssen and Johnson & Johnson portfolio that it provides us a very important position with larger healthcare systems and networks. So that's the way we think about it, and that's the way we plan for it going forward.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Alex.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Good morning, and thanks for all the help over the years, Louise, and congratulations.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask a question to Dominic first. Just the operating margin performance again kind of beat our expectations. You reiterated your guidance for the year on the operating margin on expansion side of things. But I just wanted \u2013 there're multiple drivers of operating margin expansion, and there is \u2013 you had a program in place, I think you announced a couple of years ago, and just started to ramp last year of about $1 billion in cost savings by 2018 that was exclusive of the Medical Device restructuring plan. I just wanted to get a sense of the contribution to operating margin expansion this year, and if we're still in the very early innings and whether we should see stronger benefit from that cost savings plan as well as the Medical Device restructuring initiative in 2017 and 2018.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Josh, you're right. There are many factors that contribute. I mean, GP is one, so we continue to see good manufacturing efficiencies and cost improvements across the supply chain. That's a major initiative we've had ongoing for quite some time. So we saw some of that benefit this quarter, and we expect that we'll see it going forward as well. In the selling, marketing, administrative line, that's where you see the benefits of the program you're referring to where we anticipate about $1 billion of savings through 2018. That program is on track. We're seeing the savings. We're also making some investments.","As the investments tail off, the savings will be more significant and more impactful in that line item going forward. So we're beginning to see the savings now. They're somewhat partially offset by some investments we need to make to continue the program, but in the future, those investments tail off and the savings ramp up, and they'll have more of an impact. And then also as you mentioned, the Medical Device restructuring is a whole another area that's unrelated to the two that I just mentioned earlier, and we expect to see continued improvements there, although that's a business where we want to also accelerate the pace of innovation with those savings. So some of those will be reinvested in the business. So it's across those three areas, and we're committed to the operating margin improvement that I mentioned earlier, greater than 200 basis points, and halfway through the year we feel very good about our ability to achieve that.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Excellent. I just wanted to ask a follow-up maybe for Alex and Louise. Just you commented on utilization levels in the U.S. and procedure volumes, and you experienced just a modest apples-to-apples in selling days from sequentially modest deceleration in knees and hips and spine in the Ortho segment. Is there anything specific to Q2 that you're seeing in the marketplace that you can comment on? Thanks for taking the questions.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, look, overall \u2013 and thank you for the question. Overall I think we saw solid growth in both knees and hips. I think we were at about 4.5% in knees, about 5%, 5.5% in hips. And we think that that's continued pickup from the ATTUNE launch, and the Corail Hip. So I would say that, consistent with what we're seeing in the broader market, consistent with what we're seeing in our business, we're seeing positive growth in that area.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","And for the O-U.S. business, there was about an additional 1.5 days of selling days in the second quarter. And in the first quarter we had additional selling days in the U.S. business, as a reminder on that one. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital markets. Please proceed with our question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Joanne.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much for taking the question. I appreciate the commentary on the volumes, but I was curious if you can give us commentary on pricing, and also with the April 1 implementation of the bundled payment program in the United States, if you're seeing any impact from that.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. So we talk about pricing on a Johnson & Johnson basis, and overall pricing is modest in the quarter.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I would say, Joanne, that we haven't seen the impact yet in the particular new mechanism that you just described. As Louise pointed out, pricing overall for the quarter, year-over-year growth due to pricing is very, very modest in our results.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","And I can provide some further color on hips and knees in the U.S. price mix, if you'd like.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That would be wonderful, thank you so much.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","So the second quarter for the hips was about 2.2% negative price mix together, and this is U.S. only. And for knees it was about 2.6% negative. And that's similar trends to what we've seen consistently over time.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. And then my second question had to do more with Vision Care. We saw a real difference between what was happening in the U.S. and what's OUS sales, and you commented on rebates. Is that the replacement program for UPP that we're seeing in that U.S. impact? Thanks for taking the questions.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","So it's a customer reward program that we have implemented. And what we have booked in the second quarter is the year to date because it was implemented in the second quarter but it applies to the full year sales. So in the U.S., if you normalize it for the half that applied to the first half, the U.S. is up about 6% on a like basis.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, we continue to be very pleased with what we're seeing in the turnaround in our Vision Care business as well. If we look at the early demand signals that we're seeing, it continues to give us confidence that we're gaining share. We continue to launch into beauty, astigmatism, reusables, along with a number of other new launches and line extensions. And frankly, the team is also really executing well. So we're encouraged by the opportunity that we see in Vision Care as we move through the rest of 2016.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","And next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good morning. Good morning. And, Louise, I echo the sentiments, so best of luck in the future. My question is for Alex and for Dominic. And I asked a similar question on the last quarterly call because I continue to be surprised that J&J is not doing more with its cash, particularly on the M&A front. You've done both, but we haven't seen much in the way of meaningful acquisitions on devices and on pharma. And so my question is, the targets that you're having discussions with today, do they still have very unrealistic valuation expectations, and is that the reason why we haven't seen deals in devices and pharma?","And then as a follow-up, you still have a bulk of your cash sitting outside the United States. Is that another reason why we haven't seen any meaningful acquisitions? Thank you.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Glenn. Consistent with what we said last time when you asked a very similar question, as you know, we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. And although we're actively involved in considering them, valuations come into play, and willingness of the other party to do an acquisition at certain valuations come into play. So that's regardless of how much money we have available to spend. So we don't really look at that as the main driver of how we're going to do acquisitions. We look at what value we're going to create for shareholders by doing the acquisition at the right value, so we can improve returns for our shareholders.","There are some expectations that are still not, in our opinion, normalized for appropriate valuations in the market, so that's a factor, and that will take time and we're patient with that. And then we'll see how the market evolves over time, or as we learn more about the acquisition candidates and their progress in various areas.","And then finally, whether or not the cash is trapped overseas or not is not at all an impediment to our ability to do any acquisitions. We'll either obviously try to find a way to do it in a tax-efficient basis as we've done with other acquisitions and utilize that cash as much as possible, only if it's tax efficient. But then obviously we can continue to borrow, and we have the ability to borrow to do the acquisitions that we think are value-creating for our shareholders. So we wouldn't let that hold us back. Should the acquisition be value-creating, we'd exercise our ability to borrow and do that acquisition.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just as a follow-up \u2013 oh, go ahead, Alex. Did you want to add something?","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Glenn. I guess what I would also say is look, I think that the M&A approach that we talked about in the past is a balanced one. If you look over the last 20 years, I think we've done about 124 deals. I think there's been about 13 or so that have been over $1 billion. The majority of these have been smaller. And frankly if you look at our Pharmaceutical performance, whether it's the partnerships that we have on a compound like IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, or others, I think the strategy has worked really well, and it's something that we'll continue to pursue. I think we have a lot of examples of that in Medical Devices and also Consumer. There's nothing that we would like more than to take a several hundred million dollar platform like Vogue and create the next multibillion-dollar platform as we see in things like NEUTROGENA and others. So all that being said, if\/when we see larger opportunities present an opportunity to really create longer-term shareholder value, those are things we'd certainly be interested in, but we'll be particularly thoughtful about those.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just one quickly on REMICADE. I know Matt had asked a question on REMICADE, but you remain very confident that a biosimilar won't be launched in 2016. Has anything changed that you can reveal to us on the litigation front that gives you more confidence? Thank you.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Glenn, what we said is that our guidance does not assume any biosimilar launch in 2016. There are ongoing developments in the litigation. There's a hearing scheduled for August related to the 471 patents. We'll have to see what the results of that hearing are, so we don't know that yet. There was also a ruling issued in relation to another biosimilar, not our biosimilar, which made it very clear when the 180-day waiting period applies. And for us, that 180-day waiting period extends to October 6. So obviously, there cannot be any launch before that date. And then as we've mentioned, we're continuously and vigorously defending our patent and will continue to do that.","So whether or not a biosimilar launch happens is uncertain. But we have not included it in our guidance estimates. But as you know, our guidance of course is a range and between certain ranges of 3% to 4% in overall growth. So we feel confident about that in any event.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning and congrats, Louise. Once again. I echo others' sentiments. Just two quick questions, I know we're near the end. So, Dominic, I'm trying to reconcile revenue guidance just on the margin. So if I take the upside in the quarter plus the net impact of M&A, Vogue minus the API business, I get guidance should have come up $700 million, it's coming up around $300 million. Is that difference in the back half of the year largely an expectation for lower or minimal gross-to-net adjustments in the back half versus the first half?","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Certainly as I mentioned earlier, the gross-to-net adjustments that we saw in the first half have now resulted in our overall estimates for these amounts as being largely current, greater than 90% current. So therefore, we wouldn't expect to have the same level of those kinds of adjustments going forward, David. That's right.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful, and maybe two questions on Consumer, one for Alex and one for Dominic. Dominic, just to start with you on margins, I think we left the Analyst Day feeling that Consumer margin outlook was probably conservative. But if I look at the reported results in the quarter, you're well ahead of expectations in pursuing that pure base 20% Consumer margin. So how do we think about that? Is that simply one-time in nature, or is it much more likely now you reasonably exceed your targets either in time or magnitude here in Consumer? And then a quick follow-up for Alex in Consumer.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. As you know, we were committed to this. And as Jorge Mesquita said in the Business Review Day, he was personally committed to making it happen, and we're very pleased to see that they're off to a great start. Whether they exceed the overall benchmark level in a shorter amount of time, we'll wait to see because obviously we want to see them invest behind brands and keep the momentum up in the business as well. But they're obviously off to a great start. We were confident that they would be able to do it and they've done a great job and we're confident they'll continue to do a great job in improving margins.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Alex, I think many investors have felt that Consumer was sort of kept in the closet here the last several years and clearly the last six months. The company's working hard to sort of show the Consumer franchise to a greater extent both margins and growth. My question's more on growth. If I ex-out Venezuela in the quarter, Consumer did about 5% growth. I felt like the messaging from Jorge and others was that this business could be sort of an upper single-digit grower with obviously expanding margins. What is your sense on that 5% number ex-Venezuela? I mean, do you feel confident here that Consumer is stable and can improve from these levels? Thank you.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, thank you very much. And again let me reiterate. We're really pleased with the performance that we continue to see in the Consumer group. And literally from quarter to quarter, it continues to improve in not only its core performance but market share and a number of other areas. We feel like the majority of the platforms right now we're actually gaining share.","At the same time, we realize we've got some areas such as baby, such as China, where we need to do a better job and the team is focusing on that in addition to the margin improvement that Dominic was talking about earlier. But overall, our goal is to grow faster than the market. We think we currently are. It's something that we want to do and accelerate as we go forward. And I'm very confident that Jorge and his team have got the strategies and are now executing in a manner that's going to allow them to do just that.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Danielle.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Danielle.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Danielle.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Louise, we're really going to miss you.","Question for you, Alex, just higher level. Sorry to do this, but following up on the M&A commentary, some of your competitors have been acquiring scale, most recently, Abbott and St. Jude. And I know J&J is already in a competitively advantageous position given your current product lines, but cardiovascular is an area where you're specifically under-scaled relative to some of those other competitors, and I was just wondering if you could comment on whether you think it's important to build scale within cardiology to continue to be a major competitor in med tech, or if you think there's other areas where J&J is already positioned and will continue to focus on? I'm just trying to think about the different subsectors within med tech, where you'll focus most.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Danielle. Look, consistent with what we said previously, we do think that there's an opportunity for expansion in cardiovascular. And for us, really it started several years ago when we made the decision to exit the stent business. We did the divestment of Cordis, which I think the team executed really well. And we think now the greater focus that we have, what you're seeing as a result of that, frankly, is better growth not only in our cardiovascular business, the Biosense Webster, but across the greater medical \u2013 Hospital Medical Device business that we have.","But we know that going forward, other areas in cardiovascular ranging from valves to structural heart to others could definitely be opportunities. But we're going to continue to see how the technology evolves, how the markets evolve. And fortunately, I think we're positioned in a way that gives us a lot of different opportunities.","At the same time, I would say that there are other areas in Medical Devices that we remain interested in. We talked about the vision care area. It's one where we have a very strong contact lens platform, but we think that there's opportunities, be it back of the eye, surgery and other spaces, that business could be augmented. And we'll continue to look for other thoughtful plays in orthopedics as well as in general surgery that offer growth opportunities and help us better address areas of unmet medical need as well.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. That's so helpful.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Jami.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much for the question. And, Louise, I'm really going to miss talking to you. You've been extremely helpful over the years. Dominic, I'm sorry to belabor the gross to net adjustment, but I'm unclear as to how it occurred and what it means. And I think more importantly, these are all categories, REMICADE, STELARA, SIMPONI, ZYTIGA, which are crowded categories. And can you comment on what's happening with respect to gross to net, the gap between gross to net and how it's changed over the last year or two? If it has changed at all, are you able to take the same sort of list price that you had before without having to pay a higher rebate? If you could just kind of comment on that generally.","And then also my follow-up question relates to INVOKANA. Sales again were continuing to be very strong. You're showing nice improvements in market share. What are your expectations for the whole SGLT2 class? I'm sure you've paid attention to the FDA panel meeting on Jardiance and whether or not Jardiance will get a superior label with respect to CV mortality reduction. And if it does get that label update, what that might mean to INVOKANA going forward? Thanks very much.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Jami, let me take the first question on gross to net, and then Alex will cover the SGLT2 commentary. So you asked how does it occur and what's going on with list price versus net price and those sorts of things. So just to put it in perspective, this is not unusual in our industry, as you know. Everyone in the pharmaceutical industry is estimating what the rebates might be, and then of course we'll actualize them once actual data is submitted.","Recently, that actual data has been more timely, and in that more timely data from the payers, we're able to see trends, so we're able to not only actualize prior period amounts, but we're also able to estimate better, what the ultimate gross to net variation will be going forward.","With respect to list price net of rebates, as you probably know, we've said this before, we price \u2013 we think we price our products responsibly and our overall list price increases have been relatively below, substantially below, the average industry. But in the end, the net price that's achieved is far from the gross price increase that happens. So rebates continue to be an increasing part of the business, and the overall realization of gross price to net price, that delta is expanding, I would say, over time. And therefore, as I said, now we're much more current with our ability to predict these estimates, and that's what's going on. And as I mentioned, we don't expect to see significant adjustments to this magnitude.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So you're saying the gap is going to continue to grow but you overestimated the growth of that gap and that, therefore, is the adjustment, but big picture you expect the gap to grow?","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","That's right.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Jami, regarding INVOKANA and the class, look first of all, we are pleased with the performance, the continued performance of INVOKANA in the market. I mean, it remains the number one SGLT2 in the U.S., both in new and total scripts. I think we've got between 9 million and 10 million prescriptions that have already gone out since launch. That being said, we still think that there is a good opportunity for growth in INVOKANA. It's got a very strong clinical profile that's well documented, strong access across managed care, and look we're confident that given the experience that HCPs have had with it, combined with its profile, it's going to continue to grow.","Regarding the broader issues around class, look we think that it's really good news, frankly, for Type 2 patients given some of the news that's coming out about CV benefits and really regardless of the eventual decision by the FDA regarding potential claims for other agents, we're looking forward to seeing the results of our CANVAS program that'll be coming out in about a year. And we'll have to see if these ongoing CV outcome trials validate some of the current perceptions of KOLs regarding the cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors across the drug class. We'll see. But overall, we think it's good news for patients.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. And we'll take two more questions and then have some closing remarks from Alex. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Congrats again to you, Louise. Just following up on Jami's question on the gross to net commentary, just I don't think you touched on this, but specifically on immunology it seems like a lot of those products, in particular, saw that benefit. Is there anything that you're seeing in that specific market? And maybe causing the difference there to be greater than what you see in the other therapeutic areas?","And then one other unrelated just on IMBRUVICA, came in a little bit lighter than what we were expecting, obviously a lot of good data and a lot of growth ahead. But maybe if you could just comment on the trends you're seeing there? And also, I guess it's been about a year now since a new partner on that product with Pharmacyclics and AbbVie. Just the dynamics in that partnership and how you see that relative to what you're seeing previously with Pharmaceuticals.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Let me take \u2013 Vamil, there's nothing substantially different between biologics and others, other than the biologics products tend to have a longer delay in terms of receiving the information. So therefore, there may be more adjustments related to those products in any particular period. But other than that, there's no other significant trend that we're seeing that's any different than what we see overall in the market.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And look, regarding IMBRUVICA, we're very pleased with the continued launch uptake that we see with it. It continues to be strong, good increase versus last year. And look, IMBRUVICA is also maintaining really good total patient market leadership in CLL, line two plus, mantle cell lymphoma as well as WM in the U.S. We've had additional approvals of line indications done in other markets as well. So we continue to be pleased with the performance and look forward to getting out additional information and additional indications on the compound.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, and just on the quarter, there's additional \u2013 we have a patient assistance program and there's a little bit of a bump in that. So that's probably the trend difference that you see.","Last question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please proceed with our question.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, Jayson.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. Hi, Louise. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I'll be quick. Just to clarify and kind of follow up on an earlier question, U.S. Med Device growth in the quarter decelerated from first quarter levels. International growth accelerated. There was quite a big difference in growth in these two geographies. It sounds like this is more a function of selling days with no real change in the operating environment. Is that a fair characterization?","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","So in the OUS, we have an additional 1.5 selling days on average. That contributes to the OUS growth about 220 basis points. But on top of that, we're seeing strong market growth in China. We have some strong markets in Russia, Australia in the hip. We're seeing nice growth in the Corail, also seeing some nice growth in ATTUNE. So it's a combination of both the selling days, but if you strip out the 220 basis points for selling days O-U.S., you're really seeing really nice strong growth in both hips and knees O-U.S.","Dominic J. Caruso - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Jayson, one thing I would add to that is when we're talking about the Medical Device business, obviously there's some dynamics in diabetes and some dynamics that we've talked about earlier with Vision Care with customer loyalty program. So if you look at the hospital-based medical device business and you exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, that growth did accelerate. So second quarter growth at about 4.7% and first quarter growth at about 4.2%. So on the base Hospital Medical Device business, overall we're seeing accelerated growth.","Louise Mehrotra - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. We'll have some final remarks from Alex.","Alex Gorsky - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. And as I noted earlier, look, we're really pleased with the continued momentum as evidenced by our increased guidance for both sales and earnings for the full year 2016. Look, I really believe that some of the clear strategic choices that we've been making, a really strong focus on execution, combined with an incredibly-talented group of leaders that I'm honored and humbled to be able to work with every day at Johnson & Johnson are enabling us to really deliver extraordinary achievements and results that we've just been able to share with you and to really build on the success of Johnson & Johnson going forward.

This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the first quarter of 2019. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, I'm pleased to be joined by the leaders of our business segments who will participate in our Q&A session. Joining Joe and I here in New Brunswick are: Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Consumer; Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals. ","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. ","Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding such statements included in today's presentation as well as the company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.

","Regarding today's agenda, Joe will first provide some perspective on our overall results for the first quarter. I will then review the sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights on our cash position, capital allocation deployment and our guidance for 2019 along with some considerations for the second quarter. The remaining time will be available for your questions, and we anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes. ","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.","Joseph Wolk","Great, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. We are very pleased with our strong start to 2019 and are confident in the health of our business. As you've heard us consistently say, our goal is to deliver solid financial and operational performance while also advancing innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, caregivers and consumers. During the first quarter, we demonstrated our ability to consistently deliver growth while also executing on our long-term strategies. ","A few high-level comments about each of our segments prior to Chris providing additional franchise or product-level sales insights. Our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong growth across our immunology, oncology, neuroscience and pulmonary hypertension portfolios. The ongoing investments in our pipeline, coupled with our strong commercial execution around new product launches and line extensions, enable us to more than offset erosion from biosimilars and generics. ","As you've heard us say in previous quarters, our global Pharmaceutical growth continues to be driven by volume rather than price, and we did experience another quarter of negative price. We recently issued our 2018 Janssen U.S. Transparency Report which is now available on our website. We led the industry by publishing this annual report 3 years ago, and we're proud to contribute to the information that health care providers, legislators and the general public can use to facilitate meaningful dialogue on the topic of health care costs. ","In our Consumer segment, we remain focused on competitive growth. While we observed some broad market softness during the quarter, we are encouraged by our ability to garner share in key areas like OTC, where TYLENOL regained its status as the #1 brand of analgesics as well as NEUTROGENA and OGX within Beauty. ","In the Medical Device segment, we continue to make progress on our stated goal of improved performance while continuing to enhance market-leading positions in many platforms. Additionally, in support of our long-term objectives for the segment, we are very excited about our recent acquisition of Auris Health which will enhance our digital surgery capabilities. ","The strength of our first quarter results reinforce the confidence we have in our broad-based business. We continue to manage our portfolio with discipline and make investments across the enterprise that position us well to achieve long-term sustainable growth across 3 vital aspects of health care. ","I'll now turn the call back to Chris to discuss first quarter sales drivers as well as highlight notable line items in our P&L before I return with some comments regarding our cash position and guidance.","Chris DelOrefice","Thank you, Joe. Worldwide sales were $20 billion for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 0.1% versus the first quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 3.9% as currency had a negative impact of 3.8 points. In the U.S., sales increased 1.8%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth declined by 1.7%. OUS operational sales growth was 6%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 7.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.5% worldwide: 3.1% in the U.S. and 7.9% outside the U.S. ","Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.39 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.60 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.10 representing increases of 0.5% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.8%. ","Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the first quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides that you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2018 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. ","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, growing at 2.2%. The overall market growth in the categories we participate in slowed to slightly over 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 0.7%. In addition to growing share in key brands, such as TYLENOL and NEUTROGENA, Consumer continues to grow share in the e-commerce channel, outpacing category growth rates in that channel with strong double-digit growth across all regions. ","The Beauty franchise grew 3.6% or almost 1% adjusted for the impact of the Nizoral and RoC divestitures, along with the acquisition of Dr.Ci:Labo, including its portfolio of dermocosmetic beauty products. ","Priority brands within the franchise continue to deliver strong performance, with both OGX and Maui Moisture, along with NEUTROGENA delivering above-market growth globally, with sales growth of over 4%. NEUTROGENA in the U.S. is growing share across all major categories, including facial cleansing and moisturizing treatment, acne treatment and sun protection, while OUS sales growth was strong across multiple regions driven by new launches. OGX and Maui Moisture brands continue to experience strong growth in mature markets in addition to benefiting from new market expansions. ","Over-the-counter medicines grew 5.5% globally or 3% when adjusting for the impact of the Zarbee's acquisition which continues to perform well. In the U.S., OTC share growth is well outpacing the category, led by TYLENOL which grew by over 15%, including 10% consumption growth driven by rapid-release gel and TYLENOL arthritis products. The balance of growth was mainly associated with inventory builds as a result of the prior year's supply constraints driven by Hurricane Maria. ","OUS grew almost 3% with strong sales in Asia driven by the strong performance of NICORETTE Quickmist in our smoking cessation portfolio, MOTRIN for pediatric analgesics, and RHINOCORT for allergy. Growth was partially offset by declines in our upper respiratory brands due to soft cold\/cough flu season in Northern Europe and Russia. ","Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care declined 7.4% globally. U.S. declines occurred primarily in AVEENO driven by channel shifts and market softness, while the declines outside of the U.S. are primarily due to retail destocking as the Johnson's baby relaunch expands into new markets. The Johnson's baby brand has been relaunched in 4 key markets and is growing in 3 of these markets: China, India and Canada. The U.S. experienced a modest decline consistent with the overall market decline. ","Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.2 billion grew 7.9%, enabled by double-digit growth in 9 key products. Sales were aided by some onetime U.S. pricing favorable adjustments worth almost 200 basis points worldwide. These were primarily driven by prior-period adjustments in the quarter for STELARA and INVOKANA along with the prior year comparable for REMICADE that we highlighted in the first quarter last year. Even when adjusting for these items, we delivered above-market performance globally. ","Sales increased in the U.S. by 4.3% and outside the U.S. by 12.2%. The aforementioned pricing adjustment impacted U.S. growth by just over 300 basis points reducing our U.S. growth to approximately 1%. This slower growth was primarily driven by our first full quarter of generic competition for ZYTIGA. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at competitive levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds. ","Our oncology therapeutic area delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.5%. DARZALEX continued its stellar performance growing about 51% globally. The U.S. grew 33% and continues to benefit from strong market growth and a 4-point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy. Outside the U.S., DARZALEX grew 18% and is experiencing increased penetration and share gains across Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and in the 40 EMEA countries where it is commercially available with 9 new markets added this quarter. ","IMBRUVICA grew over 40% globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. and strong uptake outside the U.S. in the European and Asia-Pacific markets. In the U.S., based on fourth quarter data across all indications and lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 2 points of market share and is the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia which gained over 5 points of market share in line 1 therapy. ","Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 15%, with declines of 55% in the U.S. driven by generic competition which was partially offset by 21% growth outside the U.S. Strong sales growth in Europe and Asia were driven by market growth and share gains primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. In nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, which gained 4 points of market share, with the penetration of prescribers split evenly among urology and oncology practices. ","Further, we are very pleased to have received approval for BALVERSA last week for the treatment of adults with locally or advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. BALVERSA is the first FGFR kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA. ","Our immunology portfolio delivered global sales growth of just under 10% driven by continued strong performance in STELARA with operational growth of 36%, primarily from the Crohn's disease indication, partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 19% due to increased discounts and modest share loss to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars. REMICADE has maintained approximately 92% of the infliximab volume share. ","The previously mentioned prior-period pricing adjustments for REMICADE and STELARA had a favorable impact on their growth by about 400 and 500 basis points, respectively, resulting in underlying global performance of a 23% decline in REMICADE and 31% growth of STELARA. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease where market share has increased by approximately 8 points in the U.S. compared to the first quarter of 2018. ","Lastly, sales for our recently launched treatment for psoriasis, TREMFYA, totaled $217 million globally. TREMFYA is experiencing strong demand with over 31,000 patients on therapy and achieved a 6.9% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S. which is up 4 points from the first quarter of 2018. ","In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well growing 17% with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, SPRAVATO was approved by the FDA in March as the first new mechanism of action in decades for treatment-resistant depression. We are excited that more than 475 treatment centers have been certified as of first quarter, and our first patient has been dosed. ","We did experience declining sales of 9.5% in our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, primarily driven by declines in XARELTO, INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO continues to increase TRx share growth. However, this growth was offset by the increase in the legislative rate for the doughnut hole from 50% to 70%, along with higher Medicare and doughnut-hole utilization resulting in an overall decline in XARELTO of 6% this quarter. ","We've seen a positive response to XARELTO's new 2.5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD and PAD indication. And while we expect the penetration of this expanded patient population to occur over time, we are confident in the value this indication provides to patients. ","Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by double digits increasing by about 15%. We realized strong growth in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI growing by about 17% and 43%, respectively, on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. As expected, TRACLEER is declining due to increased use of OPSUMIT as well as generic competition in Europe. ","I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.5 billion, declining 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of LifeScan, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.3% worldwide, an acceleration versus fourth quarter of 2018. The adjusted operational sales growth was driven by continued strong performance in Interventional Solutions, Vision and Advanced Surgery. ","Interventional Solutions grew about 18% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business achieving more than 18% growth worldwide, continuing its trend of double-digit growth. We continue to be the market leader in this underpenetrated market and gained 1 full point of market share in 2018. Our Q1 growth was driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters, contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. Additionally, we realized robust growth in our CERENOVUS business with double-digit growth globally driven by new product innovation, including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke as well as strong market growth. ","Strong Vision results of 5% were driven by contact lenses, which grew 6% globally on the strength of the daily disposables and astigmatism lenses in the OASYS family. At the end of the quarter, we were also excited to announce the availability of ACUVUE OASYS with TRANSITIONS LIGHT INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY for the U.S. market. This first-of-its-kind photochromic contact lens was named one of TIME magazine's best inventions in 2018 and seamlessly adapts to changing light, delivering more effortless sight with less squinting from dawn to dusk. ","Orthopaedics continues to close the gap versus the market with operational sales growth of 0.8% globally, delivering its fifth straight quarter of sequential improvement. Hips grew 2.7%, which we expect to represent performance in line with the market in the U.S. and share gains outside the U.S., primarily in the Asia-Pacific region driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach and continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS. ","Trauma growth of over 1% globally was driven by market growth, supported by strong adoption of newer innovations, such as our Femoral Recon Nails. The U.S. growth rate accelerated versus the fourth quarter of 2018 to 2.5%. We also experienced strong growth in Asia. However, we saw declines in EMEA, primarily driven by the timing of tender offers which impacted our growth outside the U.S. by approximately 150 basis points. ","Spine declined 1%, however, continues to improve overall performance with its fourth straight quarter of improved adjusted operational results. We continue to see stabilization of performance driven by new products, such as the VIPER PRIME system for minimally invasive surgery and EXPEDIUM VERSE, our all-in-one pedicle screw system for deformity. ","Knees declined by almost 2% in the quarter. While U.S. sales declined, we improved our performance for the fourth straight quarter driven by uptake of the ATTUNE Revision system. Sales declines outside the U.S. occurred in EMEA and were partially offset by continued growth in Asia and Latin America. ","Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in Orthopaedics but was relatively stable overall compared to the fourth quarter. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms by approximately negative 4% in spine, negative 3% in hips, negative 2.5% in trauma and negative 2% in knees. ","We were very pleased with the results for the surgery business. The Advanced Surgery performance of almost 6% growth globally was led by biosurgery with growth of approximately 10% along with strong performance in endocutters at 5% and energy at over 3%. Biosurgery strength was driven by strong demand aided by new innovation, such as SURGICEL powder. Endocutters and energy performance is primarily driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region fueled by continued adoption of newer innovation. ","In General Surgery, wound closure grew 4% as barbed and Plus Sutures are experiencing strong adoption. Selling days did not have a significant impact on our global growth rates in the first quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact in any subsequent quarter in 2019. ","As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends for the fourth quarter of 2018. Hospital admissions increased by 1% with lab procedures up about 0.5%. Surgical procedures were slightly positive. Our preliminary estimates for the first quarter of 2019 indicate a slight decline in trend in both hospital admissions and lab procedures with growth of 0.5% and flat, respectively. Surgical procedures growth in the first quarter is expected to increase to close to 1.5%. ","I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2019, please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 first quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.9 billion on an after-tax basis primarily driven by intangible amortization of $0.8 billion and an IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion, which is related to the write-down of the IPR&D asset from the acquisition of Alios Biopharma. Excluding the net impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.10, an increase of 1.9% versus the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.18, up 5.8% versus the first quarter of 2018. ","I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Both cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter slightly improved primarily driven by favorable segment mix. We continue to invest in R&D at competitive levels, and our investment in research and development this quarter as a percent of sales was 14.3%, which is higher than the first quarter 2018 by over 200 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by higher pharmaceutical milestone payments including the $300 million milestone payment to argenx associated with our worldwide license and collaboration agreement as well as higher investments in our overall portfolio. Net interest expense was lower by $142 million as a result of higher rates of interest earned as well as lower average debt balances. ","Regarding taxes in the quarter, our tax rate of 15.2% includes adjustments relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will be further highlighted in the tax footnote of the 10-Q. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.6% compared to 17.8% in the same period last year and is consistent with our expectations of the full year adjusted effective tax rate. ","Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2019, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise was consistent with the first quarter of 2018. Looking at the adjusted before tax income by segment. Pharmaceutical margins decreased by 480 basis points primarily driven by increased investments in R&D spend. Consumer margins improved by 700 basis points primarily driven by the gain related to the company's earlier investment in Ci:z Holdings. Medical Devices were essentially flat, improving 30 basis points versus last year. ","That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter 2019. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the first quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. ","I will now turn the call back to Joe.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks, Chris. With respect to cash, at the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $14 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $15 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt. A few comments about how we allocated capital in the first quarter, where once again we simultaneously executed across the 4 tenets of our strategy to create shareholder value. Reinvestment in our business continues to be a top priority at Johnson & Johnson. We invested $2.9 billion in R&D in the quarter which represents a 230 basis point increase. This was primarily driven by milestone payments and other investments to advance assets in our pipeline. ","In M&A, as we previously announced, we strengthened our Consumer business with the acquisition of Dr.Ci:Labo. In addition to R&D and M&A spending, we also used cash in the quarter to continue returning value to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, totaling $2.4 billion in the quarter. Our dividend will continue to be a key priority going forward. We also made progress on our share repurchase program in the first quarter with another $900 million of the total $5 billion authorization. We are now 36% complete. ","Now let me provide a few comments on the updates to our guidance for 2019, which we noted in this morning's press release. Our first quarter results have elevated our confidence in our performance, strengthening the outlook for our operational sales growth. As a result, we are increasing our guidance by 50 basis points, reflecting full year adjusted operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and operational sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. The negative impact of translational currency, however, has increased, but we plan to absorb that impact with the strength of our operational sales outlook I just referenced. Therefore, our expectation for total reported sales in 2019 remains the same. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but in light of my previous comments, our reported sales estimate for the year remains at minus 1.5% to minus 0.5%, utilizing an average euro spot rate of $1.12 versus the $1.14 referenced back in January. ","Now turning to other guidance items that we have updated, starting with other income and expense, which is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from items such as litigation investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We are increasing our full year expectations for other income, excluding special items, by $400 million to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion for the year. Within other income, one of the largest items that we previously announced is the successful closing of the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business, which has closed and will be reflected in the second quarter results. ","All of these factors add to our confidence in the business, and as a result, we are increasing the high end of the range for adjusted operational EPS by $0.03 per share, and we are also tightening the range, reflecting an increase of $0.05, bringing the midpoint to $8.78 per share. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements. However, the estimated negative impact of currency on EPS increased $0.05 and is now estimated to be $0.20 for the year, resulting in adjusted EPS in the range of $8.53 to $8.63 per share. All other items of guidance remain consistent with what we provided in January. ","The strength of our business reflected in the quarter makes us even more confident in the guidance we just provided and enables us to absorb the impact to EPS of incremental currency headwinds and our investment in Auris Health. Additionally, our higher level of expected other income provides the flexibility to deploy higher levels of investment to fortify and accelerate our pipelines as you saw on our elevated level of R&D spend in the first quarter. ","In summary, in light of last year's 210 basis point improvement in operating margins and this year's EPS growth to sales growth ratio, coupled with other capital deployment, Johnson & Johnson continues to create a compelling value proposition for investors. ","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, as with last quarter, we'd like to provide you with a few qualitative factors to consider in your modeling. Here's what we know or expect for the second quarter of 2019. Our divestiture of our Advanced Sterilization Products business closed on April 1, 2019, and as noted earlier, this comprises a large majority of the other income for 2019. Given that divestiture, we will have minimal Advanced Sterilization Products sales in the second quarter. We also expect that currency will still be a headwind in the second quarter, but not as significant as experienced in the first quarter. And finally, looking back, the second quarter of 2018 represented the highest sales quarter in the year, so you might anticipate a more challenging year-over-year comparison, particularly as we expect some of the generic and biosimilar erosion in our Pharmaceutical segment to potentially accelerate. ","That concludes our overview of the first quarter performance. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we are very pleased with our solid first quarter results, but we are also unrelenting in our pursuit of growth, meeting patient needs and driving value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders. ","Before I hand the call back over to Chris, let me take a moment to thank in advance Ashley, Jennifer and Thibaut for being part of this call and to welcome Thibaut to his first Johnson & Johnson earnings call. Thibaut is a seasoned global leader who has lived and worked on 5 continents across all 3 segments of Johnson & Johnson's business in his 19 years with the company. Prior to his new role, Thibaut served as the leader of the Johnson & Johnson Consumer Asia-Pacific region. It's great to have you all here. ","I'll now turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A portion.","Chris DelOrefice","Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","One for Ashley and one for Joe. Ashley, can you talk about the Auris deal and your surgical robot? What's the plan for rolling out Monarch? How long do you think it will take to integrate Neuwave onto that platform? And I think the price paid made some people feel it was a hedge for the Verb joint venture, because Auris also has a surgical robot in development. So can you confirm that you still plan to launch your surgical robot in 2020? And Joe, just -- I'll ask my second question up front for you. The $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion in other income, can you talk about how that might create a headwind to EPS growth in 2020? How you're thinking about that line item going forward?","Joseph Wolk","Go ahead, Ashley.","Ashley McEvoy","Okay. Great. Thanks, Larry, for the question. Listen, we're very pleased to welcome Auris to the J&J family. Just spent some time with them last week at close and to really welcome Dr. Fred Moll, who many of you know is a true pioneer in the field of robotics. We view the acquisition of Auris as highly complementary to our Verb program as well as our Orthopaedics program in Orthotaxy. And what I'm very excited about is the for-revenue product of Monarch. You know all of us as a world leader in open surgery and a world leader in laparoscopic surgery. I'm pleased to share that we're now for revenue in endoluminal surgery, and we plan to take advantage of the world-class robotics expertise, advanced instrumentation our partnership with Verily of creating a connected experience and then, clearly, our very robust global infrastructure to have a very competitive value proposition in the field of digital surgery. Thanks for the question, Larry.","Joseph Wolk","Great. With respect to the other income number for this year, the new ranges, if you look at the upper end, pretty much on par with what we experienced in 2015. And then in 2016, we had elevated sales growth, and we were able to manage that. As we look towards 2020, we would have the same intentions in mind. So as we anniversary some of the generic or biosimilar erosion later this year, that provides a tailwind into 2020's top line growth. Additionally, we have a number of, I'd say, cost improvement initiatives throughout the organization, most notably in supply chain. We announced a little bit earlier a partnership with Jabil. That's going extremely well. And we use these funds really as a flexibility to invest. So we just spoke about Auris and the investment there. That would have been otherwise dilutive, all things being equal, but we were able to absorb that with the strength of the first quarter and some of the other income proceeds that we think we're going to have throughout the course of 2019. So it's not lost on us, Larry, that we need to manage towards that and provide the consistency in terms of earnings growth that has become expected of Johnson & Johnson.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just a couple for me. Joe, I'll start with you and then maybe one for Ashley. Joe, just want to talk about the guidance here for the year. So you're raising guidance earlier in the year than you did last year. So it's an expression of kind of confidence in the year. So what is driving sort of your confidence this early in the year to raise the guidance? And as you talked about the factors which you should expect for 2019, what's changed your mind? Is pharma stronger; Consumer, a little weaker? These broad themes across the segments, does that all still hold? And what's providing the incremental confidence?","Joseph Wolk","Great. Thanks, David, for the question. Yes, and we are much more confident at this point in the year than maybe we were a year ago and certainly for the balance of 2019, what we thought would occur in January. If you recall, in the January discussion that we had, we forecasted a range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion of generic biosimilar erosion. Probably, the higher end of that range, just based on first quarter results, has subsided a little bit, so it's probably closer to the $3 billion number. It's also, though, attributable to the strengths of the core products. So DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA just having tremendous impact on patients, on the health care system overall, and that's translating into good business for Johnson & Johnson. ","With Medical Devices, I think we've gotten to that number that begins with a 4, which we've been striving for. And obviously, we're looking for better performance moving forward. But we got there pretty quickly, if you think about where we were in the fourth quarter, about 3.3% I'll call it unadjusted or adjusted growth, leading up to 4.3%. That gives us a little bit more confidence. And so we saw, while there's still more work to do in U.S. Orthopaedics, a quarter of growth, which is a positive sign.","David Lewis","Okay, very helpful. And then Ashley, just on the devices, 2 questions here: First is off Larry's question on Auris. When can the investor kind of expect to see a prototype platform? And can you just update us on any regulatory terms, either U.S. or ex U.S.? Can we still think about early 2020 as the first global approval in some market? And then another question, just on Recon, Ashley, just coming off AAOS. Ortho performance is getting better, but the Recon performance took a small step backward this particular quarter. How much of that do you think is attributable to changes in market growth this quarter relative to share dynamics in a worldwide new franchise?","Ashley McEvoy","Sure. Thanks, David, for the questions. With Auris, the real value is that we actually, as I mentioned their first-generation Monarch, we are for revenue in endoluminal. And we have a lung program at J&J, which is really about preventing, intercepting and curing lung cancer, which is one of the top cancers. And a lot of it is because people get diagnosed at end -- at late stage, where you have -- 18% have a 5-year survival rate. So early detection makes a big deal for better outcomes. And so Monarch will be a really nice enabler of early diagnosis, accessing the very distal parts of the lung for better diagnosis. And you can imagine to Larry's earlier question, really we have an active development program of bringing in potential treatments like ablation or potential dispersal of oncolytic viruses. So that's really generation 1. ","You mentioned another area that we're assessing, obviously, is digital surgery for broader indications in General Surgery as well as in Orthopaedics. And again, I would say we view the Auris acquisition as highly complementary to our Verb program. I was at Verb just last week, and I'm pleased with how they're knocking down risk every day. They have completed all preclinical procedural developments for several procedures. They've engaged with hundreds of surgeons. They're engaging right now with notified bodies on the regulatory pathways. So I would say, stay tuned. We're going to take the best insight from Dr. Fred Moll and really have him assess both of these programs and make sure that we have a highly differentiated value proposition at launch.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott","My first one's a broader one on the pharma market. I'd just be interested in your views on Medicare Part D reform and a potential shift away from drug rebates over time. I guess specifically, how do you think about the potential change to Part D as it relates to J&J? And longer term, do you see the broader U.S. market including the commercial market, moving more towards a net pricing dynamic versus this current kind of gross price and rebate structure as we think about, let's say, the next 3 to 5 years? ","My second question was on TREMFYA. Just a little bit more color in terms of how you're seeing the competitive landscape in psoriasis shaping up as we think about IL-23s, IL-17s and the TNFs. As well as how you're thinking about AbbVie's risankizumab launch later this year as you think about your kind of positioning within the IL-23s?","Jennifer Taubert","Chris, it's Jennifer. The first piece -- the first part of your question, Chris, was really around Medicare Part D and rebate reform. And as we take a look at it, we're really supportive of rebate reform and finding ways to actually get those dollars in discounts and rebates actually back to the patient. Out-of-pocket costs, as you know, are really one of the things that are causing a lot of pain in the marketplace right now. And so we're supportive of the administration's efforts on rebate reform, and we're taking a look at how we can actually implement that in a pretty rapid way. So it's going to depend on what ultimately comes out, but we're looking at it closely and believe that we'll be well poised to be able to move into the marketplace following sort of new market dynamics with rebate reform. We really look forward to patients being able to have more affordable out-of-pocket costs. ","In terms of TREMFYA, we had a really terrific quarter with TREMFYA with $217 million globally. As we've talked about the product, it's performing really well on the market. And all of our clinical data and comparative data continue to reinforce what we're seeing, and this is really being a true leading brand in psoriasis. So as you recall, we've got head-to-head superiority versus Humira. We got superiority versus STELARA in patients with -- that are STELARA-inadequate responders. And most recently, we've announced our data that shows superior efficacy versus Cosentyx at PASI 90 at 48 weeks. And so we've really been able to demonstrate that the product performs not only rapidly for patients but that it's got great durability as well. And both together are what's most important to both providers as well as to patients. ","I think importantly, as well, we now have data out through 3 years, demonstrating really consistency of effect and believe that, that's going to be good for us whether we're competing versus the IL-17, whether we're competing versus the old anti-TNF or whether we're competing against the upcoming IL-23s that are coming. So we've got a very a strong portfolio of data there to help us continue to succeed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","I'd like to turn just for a moment to expense items and the headwinds that you'll be seeing in the Pharmaceutical business throughout the rest of the year. How should we think about the impact on the gross margins?","Joseph Wolk","Joanne, this is Joe. First of all, let me just say nice job on TV this morning. You did great. Well, I'll say with expense one, I would go to our guidance where we say we will see slight improvement. We'll always look for opportunities to invest. But I think a slight improvement is where we're targeting for this year. Remember last year, we improved about 210 basis points on operating margins, and then given the current EPS growth rate to sales growth ratio, we think that's extremely healthy. So we're going to look for areas to invest. While we have these other cost initiatives, I would say, closer to their infancy, the supply chain one that I mentioned in my earlier reply is just getting started. We'll start to see the impact of that in 2020 and beyond.","Joanne Wuensch","Terrific. And as my second question. I just want to drill down a little bit more on knees because that one seems to be one of the components in Orthopaedics that's lagging somewhat, and we have not just one but two robotic knee systems on the market. How do we think about that turning before your own system arrives at the end of next year?","Ashley McEvoy","Thank, Joanne. This is Ashley. Thanks for the question. And David, forgive me, I wasn't answering knees. But I would say that we consider our performance in knees as stabilizing. We posted a 2% decline in the quarter. It was down about 2% in the United States which is pretty consistent with prior quarters. We did experience a decline OUS predominantly driven by EMEA, which included really due to predominantly onetimers. So we would say stable. What we're committing to do is really get the news out about ATTUNE's knee performance. We've got 5-year data now in 4 registries. So we're getting the news out at the congresses. I think you saw that in Las Vegas. Our ATTUNE Revision is performing quite well. It's up 10%, and we plan to launch our cementless offering later this year. And then, clearly, I think if you were in Las Vegas, you saw a peak at our robotics offering at the AAOS. And that combination, we believe, is what will eventually get us to above-market performance. In the interim, we will be challenged until we get our cementless out there, we get our robot out there.","Chris DelOrefice","Thanks, Ashley. Maybe just to build on Ashley's comment, we would have experienced positive growth OUS. That comp she referenced was worth a little over 250 basis points, just to put that in context for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert Hopkins","Just two quick questions. First, Joe, I just wanted to clarify the guidance increase on revenue growth of 50 basis points. Is that basically the net of -- what you just talked about was the $3 billion to $3.5 billion headwind being a little bit better, strong core pharma growth, and then obviously, also the price increase in pharma that you talked about? Are those the things that are different in the quarter in the guidance?","Joseph Wolk","So Bob, I would say, that's largely it. I'm not sure you referenced to a price increase. We actually experienced a price decrease again in the quarter overall, other than the PPA adjustment that Chris referenced in his commentary. So it is a stronger outlook with respect to the pharmas group, driven by the core portfolio as well as those products not being as impacted as quickly. With respect to generics and biosimilar erosion, I'd say Medical Device is probably a tick stronger than we thought back in January. And in Consumer, we're continuing to monitor. Again, we feel very good about the share levels that we attained, and we do think there might be a slight market contraction. And I don't know, maybe, Thibaut, you can speak to that for -- with a few words?","Thibaut Mongon","Yes. Absolutely, Joe. We saw in the first quarter a contraction of the market compared to what we experienced in the second half of 2018. Looking into 2019, we expect the market to be down a little bit. But our estimate for the full year growth of the market in which we compete is around 2% for the full year.","Joseph Wolk","Yes. And just to maybe put some further context around those numbers, Bob. It was about 1.1% growth in the quarter for the categories in which we compete. The second half of last year is closer to 2.5% to 2.7%. So we did see a deceleration. We'll see if it's temporary or something that's much more sustainable. Do you have another question, Bob?","Robert Hopkins","Yes. Just one quick one. One question on Vision care, which sort of stood out as a positive result in the quarter. I'm just curious was the better contact lens growth in Q1 in your view more market related or market share related. And I'm just wondering if you could provide any color on the new contact lens that you're referring to in terms of just putting it in perspective for us of how meaningful maybe increasing growth that could drive for that franchise.","Ashley McEvoy","Sure. Thanks, Bob. It's Ashley. We have to get you to try our new OASYS TRANSITIONS with light management. A lot of our baseball players in opening season have started to use it. But yes, we're pleased with our performance in contact lenses, as I mentioned about 6%. It's had about 3 years of consistent above-market performance. Very strong OUS performance as well in contact lens, and really innovation has been driving that. So the market has been healthy. We've been performing a bit above the market, so we've been gaining market share in our contact lens business. And really, emerging markets is driving that as well as innovation and meaningful innovation in some of the developed markets. And I think we just shared that we just completed Phase III trials for our allergy, our drug-eluting contact lens with an antihistamine. So we expect that to come to market in 2020.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVP Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy","I just want to follow up on some of the questions around the updated guidance. I mean, you came -- it seems like the momentum was sustained versus Q4 on this with a whole quarter of ZYTIGA. And I understand, Joe, what you said about there are some things that got a little bit better, some things that have posted maybe incrementally a little bit worse, i.e., on the Consumer side. But it feels like -- and I appreciate comps get harder as we move through the year. But the -- it looks like the guidance suggests still a meaningful step-down on that operational adjusted sales growth number. And so I guess, I'm just pushing a little bit. It sounds like is it right to read your updated guidance as you're updating partially for the outperformance that we saw in Q1. But maybe this gives you a little bit more confidence of the potential upside because, again, the deceleration suggest that from here, after what was a pretty strong Q1, I would argue is pretty significant. So just trying to get a little bit more from you on what's reflected there.","Joseph Wolk","Okay, Danielle. So we are more confident than what we were in January. That should be clear with the guidance. In terms of further confidence, we'll see how the year unfolds. Some things that we haven't mentioned yet is one, ZYTIGA, while we held on pretty good for a small molecule in the first quarter, given usual erosion rates, we do expect that to accelerate. And recall, that's going to be a comparison against a brand that was growing throughout 2018. You also have TRACLEER and VELCADE that will probably see generics in the coming months. And PROCRIT has had some activity in terms of erosion, but the competitor or the generic entry there had some manufacturing entries which have now been remediated, as we understand. So we're taking all those into account in the guidance we're providing today.","Danielle Antalffy","And a quick follow-up on the Consumer side of things. Just wondering, it seems like Q1 tends to be -- and maybe I'm misremembering, but seems like Q1 tends to have been a little bit weak for you guys in the past. Is there some dynamic in the market that has changed that causes the softer Q1 versus the back half of the year? It sounds like you're calling out more market contraction versus anything J&J-specific. Any color there?","Thibaut Mongon","Yes. Thank you for the question, Danielle. It's true that each quarter is different in the Consumer business due to macro factors and also the seasonality of our business. So our Q1 result can be affected, for example, by the season in cold and flu segments. This year, we saw soft cold and flu seasons in some parts of the world, and that can have an impact on the quarter. That's what happened in Q1, for example. So yes, macro and seasonal effects have an impact on the quarter-to-quarter performance.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.","Joshua Jennings","Two for Jennifer. Just first on esketamine, thanks for some of the details on the prepared remarks by Chris. I wonder if you could give any incremental color. I think you mentioned 475 centers are already certified, first dose to a patient provided in the commercial setting. Anything else you can help share? And maybe just to start with, just as one trigger, Jennifer, how should we think about the centers certification ramp going over the course of 2019 and into 2020? Any other color you can share? ","And then the second question is just on cardiovascular and other. XARELTO, appreciate the details on the doughnut hole and the decline in Q1, but there's some positive things on the horizon there including the filing for prevention of DVT in medically ill patients. But just what's the outlook there for XARELTO in terms of returning to growth? And then lastly, in the same category, INVOKANA, any expectations in terms of whether the CREDENCE data can turn that franchise around?","Jennifer Taubert","Thanks. So yes, we received approval and launched SPRAVATO, which is esketamine, in the first quarter, and that was following the breakthrough therapy designations. And so it was approved for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression along with an oral antidepressant in patients who've tried 2 or more antidepressant therapies in that current episode. The product is also available with a REMS program, as anticipated. And as part of that REMS program, it requires that we do certify the sites. And then we also enroll patients in the REMS program prior to administration. ","So the interest in SPRAVATO has been really high, and that is across insurance plans, providers as well as patients. And actually, a quick update. I know we spoke about the 465 center certification earlier today, but the number -- I just got some new numbers. It's actually up as high as 800 sites that have now been certified and are approved to begin treating patients. Importantly, we've actually got a number of patients who have actually been dosed with the product and some that actually have had multiple doses successfully. So we believe that we're off to a very, very strong start with SPRAVATO, and that it is going to be an important growth driver for us. ","The sites, because of the REMS program, are an important component. That's where the patients will need to go for treatment. And right now, with that number up as 800 sites already certified, we're well on track with our plans for the year there. So looking forward to being able to hopefully treat a large number of patients with SPRAVATO to help them with their treatment-resistant depression. So early days still. Realize that it's only been on the market a few weeks, but we're very encouraged by the signs that we're seeing. ","If we then move over to XARELTO. So XARELTO, both TRxs and share grew in the first quarter. But unfortunately, that growth was offset by the increase in doughnut-hole expenses that moved from 50% to 70% and also, a greater percentage of patients that were in Medicare and Medicaid, which are the most heavily discounted channels. ","If I give you a little bit more of the dynamics in what's going on underneath all of that and, hopefully, reasons for belief of success of the asset going forward. The CAD\/PAD launch is going very well. And the launch is really consistent or even better than launch benchmarks that we had with such products like ENTRESTO or BRILINTA, that have been proven to be very successful in the market. We've seen very positive response to the 2.5 milligram vascular dose that we launched, and we do really expect this to be a significant contributor for us going forward. As a reminder, there's about 13 million patients that have CAD\/PAD. While we're starting in a subset, there is extraordinary need for products like XARELTO in patients that have CAD\/PAD. Additionally, we filed for medically ill. We filed an sNDA at the end of December based on our MARINER and MAGELLAN trials and look forward to hopefully getting approval and being able to launch that indication in the U.S. in 2019. ","And then last on INVOKANA. INVOKANA, we just recently reported the results of our CREDENCE study, showing that the product significantly reduces the risk of renal failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This is a 30% reduction of the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease with just things like dialysis, transplant, doubling of serum creatinine or renal and cardiovascular death, so really, really robust results. There are also further secondary end points that were extraordinarily positive in that study. ","We plan to work with the regulators to get an indication along those lines, and then to also work with payers to see if we've got the opportunity to enhance our formulary positions and get this product available for more patients. We've been limited because of some of the safety labeling for the product and that, that's impacted it. We're hopeful that the CREDENCE data in bringing that forward is another opportunity for patients. We'll help work to try to shift that balance and perceptions around the benefit risk profile.","Operator","Next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Just have a few. In PAH, we're coming up on two 2 years post-closing Actelion. So just curious, when we think about the UPTRAVI trajectory, are there commercial drivers, say, geographically or share, that are notable for the next year? So maybe how is that different than your original expectation? And then, Joe, in pharma this year, you talked about the headwinds from generics and biosimilars. The new launches may take some time or change the growth profile back to what you guys view as above market. So maybe at a higher level, would you view 2019 as a trough? Or is there risk that you think the deceleration in pharma could persist going into 2020?","Jennifer Taubert","I'll go ahead and start off on Actelion. So our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by double digits in the first quarter, so an increase of 15%. But if you go a little bit deeper on that together, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI delivered over $500 million in sales. And OPSUMIT had growth of 17%, and UPTRAVI had growth of 43%. So we do think that UPTRAVI is a significant driver for that business for us going forward. And also, as we anticipated when we did the deal originally, the strong growth that we're seeing with UPTRAVI is really coming from a few different areas: continued share gains, but also greater market penetration and earlier use. ","I believe as we put our commercial capabilities across these assets and with UPTRAVI being the newest one, we continue to get approval and get not only registration but access to reimbursement for the asset globally, which is having a lift. We're selling the product in as really the first oral PRA and really trying to drive earlier and earlier usage in the PAH treatment continuum, because we believe the best thing for patients is more aggressive treatment and earlier on in therapy. And so it's really showing in the results that we've seen and with that 43% growth.","Joseph Wolk","Great. Thanks, Jennifer. And then, Geoff, to answer your second question, in terms of a trough. I would say 2019 is when we would expect the largest impact from generic or biosimilar erosion. That's why we were so specific in January to outline that impact. We'll continue to see great core growth. If you look at immunology, STELARA still has market opportunities within Crohn's disease as well as some other indications. TREMFYA, most patients on psoriasis are still not treated with a biologic, so we've got a great opportunity there. Oncology will still be significant with IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. And remember outside the U.S., we still have ZYTIGA exclusivity, so we're in good shape there, the Actelion assets that Jennifer just referenced and the XARELTO indications. So I would see 2019 as a trough, and once we anniversary some of these patent losses, we should be even stronger than we were in the first quarter and back to that well above-market projection for Pharmaceutical.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Vamil Divan of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","So just a couple, if I could. One high-level one on pharma, and following up on Chris' earlier question around rebate reform. And I guess I'm -- just the question I'm getting at, and I think investors are also wondering about, is how to think about the actual list prices if the safe harbor is removed from Part D. So is it safe to assume that the list price will come down to where net prices currently are? Or is it possible that the list prices may end up at higher price than where the net prices currently are in the market? ","And then my second question, just a specific one. I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But in terms of REMICADE and the biosimilar impact, can you just share what percentage of the infliximab market you still have with the brand?","Jennifer Taubert","Sure. Why don't I start off...","Chris DelOrefice","Let me look that one up, as you start with the first question.","Jennifer Taubert","Okay. I was going to say on the REMICADE one. I know I've got that one. So we are continuing to see erosion of REMICADE, as expected. But if we take a look, our team has been really competing in the marketplace to try to ensure that patients who would like to stay on REMICADE have the access and the availability to do so. And right now, we've been able to retain about 92% of the volume share for infliximab, but obviously, albeit at a lower and a very competitive price in the market. ","In terms of rebate reform, I think we're going to have to wait and see what ultimately is going to come forward in terms of the rebate rule. There are some options that could include patients essentially having some of that rebate flow through at the pharmacy. There's others that would require essentially -- or that would involve lowering list prices going forward. I think it's really important, as you think about our business, 100% of our growth and the robust growth that we've seen, not only in this first quarter but also last year or before, is due to volume, not due to price. So, however, we move forward, with whatever type of rebate reform, we do believe it's going to be positive for patients, help patient out-of-pocket costs. And that, as J&J and based on our business model, we're going to be really well poised to succeed in that environment. So again, I mentioned earlier, we're working through a number of different scenarios, and we'll have to see what ultimately comes forward. But we believe that we're really well positioned to be able to continue to succeed in that environment.","Joseph Wolk","Yes. Vamil, just to put a number or 2 around that. So last year, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business had $21 billion in discounts. We experienced net price decrease of 6.8%, yet we still had 8% growth. Unfortunately, those increased discounts aren't getting to the patients who go to the pharmacy on a monthly basis. They're experiencing elevated co-pays from what they had at least 3 or 5 years ago and even more recently. So that's where the system really needs to be fixed. But that should not have an impact on really how we drive our growth, and that's through innovation of unmet medical needs.","Operator","Next question will be coming from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford","Just a couple. On med devices, in response to an earlier question, Joe, you mentioned that you're looking for better performance going forward. Just for context, is the baseline now the 1Q growth of 4.3%? Or is your comment related to the 3.2% growth in '18?","Joseph Wolk","So yes, I guess I think is a quick answer to that one, Jayson. Ashley is smiling at me. We want to see better performance. It's really benchmarked or anchored in our statement last year on our Medical Device in Analyst day, where we want to be at or above market by 2020. You've seen a consistent trajectory each and every quarter. So whether we're going to say 4.3% is now the new bar, we'll have to see how the quarters play out. But we're really looking at that 2020 horizon to make sure that we're at market performance or better.","Ashley McEvoy","Yes, and I would just add, Jayson, to the question. Just to say, listen, the quarters aren't necessarily always linear. But consistent with what we did in '18 of improving year-over-year growth acceleration, that's absolutely what we plan to achieve in 2019.","Jayson Bedford","Okay. That's helpful. Just on Consumer, obviously a bit more of a challenging quarter. Looks like your expectation for market growth is down about 100 basis points. I appreciate the seasonal dynamics, but what do you think is the source of the softness? Is it geographic in nature? Is there price dynamic? Just a little more color there.","Thibaut Mongon","Yes. Thank you for the question. We see a deceleration in the first quarter. As I said, some of that is related to the seasonality and the structure of our portfolio. If you look at our OTC business, while we are very pleased with our performance overall for the quarter, we saw some softness due to the cold and flu season in Russia and Western Europe. If you look at Beauty, we see some deceleration in the market, but we continue to outperform the market in important geographies for us, like the United States. Baby is another category where we saw some deceleration in this winter, which affects our winter-related products. So it's really seasonality. We also see some impact of destocking in some retailers and some geographies. So I would say it's broadly based across geographies. Having said that, we expect the softness expected in Q1 to rebound in the balance of the year to hit our projected growth for the markets where we compete, of 2% for the year.","Chris DelOrefice","Great. Thank you, Jayson. Appreciate the question. Thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I do want to remind you that our Pharmaceutical business review in New Brunswick is on May 15, and we look forward to seeing all of you there. ","I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to all of you who participated in or listened to today's webcast. We hope you enjoyed the expanded management Q&A panel and that you sensed the confidence we have in our 2019 outlook which should set us up well for even better performance in 2020 and beyond. As Chris referenced, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Pharmaceutical business review day. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. ","Joining me on the podium today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details.","This meeting is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations\u2019 section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. ]","Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2012 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. At the completion of Alex\u2019s remarks Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the third quarter results and discuss guidance for 2013. We will then open the call to your questions. We will conclude our formal presentations at approximately 9:45 and following Q&A with some final remarks by Alex, we\u2019ll conclude this portion of the meeting around 10:15. ","Following a break, we will resume at 11 and begin the medical devices and diagnostics business review that was rescheduled because of Hurricane Sandy. That program will include presentations by Gary Pruden, Worldwide Chairman, Global Surgery Group; Karen Licitra, Worldwide Chairman, Global Medical Solutions Group; and Michel Orsinger, Worldwide Chairman, DePuy Synthes Companies. ","We will break for lunch and the technology displays around noon, and resume the presentations at approximately 12:45. We will include a question and answer panel at the end of the presentations, and expect to close the meeting around 2:30.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note this webcast includes slides, which are also available on the website.","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2011 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations\u2019 section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","A number of the compounds and products discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide lists the acknowledgment of those relationships.","Now I would like to review our results from the first quarter of 2012. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let\u2019s begin with the schedule titled \u201cSupplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area.\u201d","Worldwide sales to customers were $17.6 billion from the first quarter of 2012, up 8% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. On an operational basis, sales were up 9.3% and currency had a negative impact of 1.3%.","The acquisition of Synthes was completed in the second quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter, the acquisition, net of the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business, contributed 5.6% to the worldwide operational sales growth.","In the U.S., sales were up 6.8%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 11.2%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.3 points. The western hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 18.7% operationally, while Europe grew 10.4% on an operational basis. The Asia-Pacific\/Africa region grew 8.5% operationally. The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made strong contributions to the results in all regions. ","If you\u2019ll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings attributable to Johnson & Johnson were $2.6 billion, compared to $218 million in the same period in 2011. Earnings per share were $0.91 versus $0.08 a year ago.","Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the accompanying table on non-GAAP measures, 2012 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude special items, primarily related to an increase in the litigation accrual and program costs associated with the DePuy ASR hip, in-process research and development, and integration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Synthes, Inc.","Fourth quarter 2011 net earnings included after-tax special items of $2.9 billion as detailed in the reconciliation on non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.19, representing increases of 7.9% and 5.3% respectively as compared to the same period last year.","I would now like to make some comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2012, cost of goods sold, at 34.2%, was up 140 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to an inventory step up charge related to the Synthes acquisition. ","Excluding the inventory step up charge, which has been treated as a special item, cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points versus the same period last year. Incremental amortization expense related to Synthes was almost completely offset by positive mix, complemented by cost reduction efforts. ","Fourth quarter selling, marketing, and administrative expenses, at 32.2% of sales, were down 140 basis points due to cost containment initiatives across many of our businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percentage of sales was 13.3%, consistent with our 2011 results.","Interest expense, net of interest income of $89 million, was down $59 million versus the fourth quarter of 2011, due to a lower debt level. Other expense, net of other income, was $319 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to $2.9 billion in the same period last year.","Excluding special items, other income net of other expense, up $420 million, was $81 million less than 2011 due to lower gains on divestitures. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate of 18% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 14.4% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide commentary on taxes in his remarks.","Now, turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the full year of 2012, consolidated sales to customers for the year 2012 were $67.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% as compared to the same period last year. On an annual basis, sales grew 6.1 points operationally and currency had a negative impact of 2.7 points. Synthes, net of the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business, contributed 3.1% to the worldwide operational sales growth. ","On the consolidated statement of earnings, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the box section. For the year 2012, adjusted net earnings were $14.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were $5.10, up 3.4% and 2% respectively versus the 2011 results. ","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the fourth quarter of 2012. I\u2019ll begin with the consumer segment.","Worldwide consumer segment sales from the first quarter of 2012 of $3.7 billion decreased 0.4% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 0.9% while the impact of currency was negative 1.3%. U.S. sales were down 3.6%, while international sales grew 3.2% on an operational basis. ","Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 2.8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to international sales of powders, wipes, and haircare products. Sales in the oral care business increased 2% operationally due to strong sales outside the U.S. with the continued success of new product launches for Listerine.","From the first quarter of 2012, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 2.6% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2011, with U.S. sales down 3.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.7% on an operational basis.","Sales in the U.S. decreased primarily due to lower sales of analgesics due to supply constraints and competitive pressures in nutritional products. This were partially offset by very strong sales of upper respiratory products with the relaunch of many of them. Increased market penetration and product launches drove strong growth of analgesics, digestive health, and upper respiratory products outside the U.S.. ","Our skincare business declined 3.9% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the U.S. down 4.5% due to divestitures and discontinued programs, while sales outside the U.S. were down 3.4% due to competitive and marketplace pressures. ","Women\u2019s health grew 5.5% on an operational basis due to international sales growth of 9.4%, with strong growth across the sanitary protection category. Wound care, other sales decreased 2.9% on an operational basis with the sales decline outside the U.S. of 8% due to competitive pressures, partially offset by growth in the U.S. of 1.8%.","That completes our review of the consumer segment, and I\u2019ll now review highlights for the pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter of $6.5 billion increased 7.1% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 8.5%, with a negative currency impact of 1.4 points. Sales in the U.S. increased 4.4%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 12.1%. ","Now, reviewing sales for the major therapeutic areas, immunology products achieved double digit operational sales growth of 10.4%. Sales in the U.S. increased 3.4% while sales outside the U.S. increased 35.7% operationally. ","Simponi grew 54.8% operationally, with U.S. sales up 16.1% due primarily to strong market growth. In the quarter, sales outside the U.S. were up 96.8% on an operational basis, primarily due to increased shipments to our distribution partner and the continued success of the launch in Japan.","On an operational basis, STELARA was up 31.2%, with the U.S. up 25.4% and sales outside the U.S. up 40.1% operationally. The strong results were due primarily to market share gains, complemented by strong market growth in the major regions. Remicade grew 5.5% on an operational basis. Strong sales results were achieved in the U.S. with growth of 12.2% due to double digit market growth.","Combined export and international sales were down just over 2% on an operational basis. As I mentioned last quarter, timing of shipments due to customer inventory planning impacted the quarterly comparisons. Excluding the impact of customer inventory planning, combined export and international sales underlying growth in the quarter was approximately 8% on an operational basis. ","With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. Sales of infectious disease products increased 22.6% on an operational basis. INCIVO, a treatment for hepatitis C, contributed approximately half of the infectious disease worldwide operational growth in the quarter. INCIVO sales nearly doubled when compared to the third quarter of 2012. ","Continued momentum in market share growth of PREZISTA made notable contributions to the results, as to the combined sales of [complarent] and EDURANT. Neuroscience product sales decreased 1.6% on an operational basis. Growth was impacted by generic competition for RISPERDAL, CONCERTA, RAZADYNE, TOPAMAX, and DURAGESIC.","The long-acting injectable antipsychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, or [zeplion] achieved operational growth of nearly 15% due to an increase in combined market share. INVEGA achieved strong operational growth of 18.9%, with the U.S. growth at 15.2% primarily due to market growth. Outside the U.S., sales grew 23% operationally, primarily due to strong growth in Japan. ","Sales of oncology products increased 48.5% on an operational basis, due to very strong results for ZYTIGA and VELCADE. ZYTIGA is now approved to treat both chemo refractory and chemo na\u00efve metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 75%, with U.S. sales growing 34.1% and sales outside the U.S. more than doubling.","VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 47.6% on an operational basis. Approximately 60% of the operational increase is due to the timing of tender business, which will negatively impact the growth in the first quarter of 2013. Strong performance in patient share in the frontline setting continues to drive sales growth. ","Regarding Doxil\/Caelyx, we had made significant progress to restore a reliable supply. An alternate manufacturing approach consisting of a collaboration between the current third-party manufacturer and another supplier to complete end-to-end production of Doxil\/Caelyx was approved in the E.U. and Japan late in 2012 and in Canada earlier this month.","In the European Union, the Caelyx Managed Access Program will remain in place until a full supply of Caelyx has been restored to ensure patients can complete their full course of treatment. In the U.S., Janssen announced in October 2012 that full access to Doxil has been restored. ","While Janssen continues to work with the FDA to seek approval of the alternate manufacturing solution, the agency is exercising its regulatory discretion to release Doxil manufactured through this approach to the U.S. market to ensure continued full access to Doxil for healthcare providers and their patients. ","Other pharmaceutical products declined 6.8% on an operational basis, due to divestitures, lower sales of PROCRIT primarily related to market decline and Eprex and Aciphex\/Pariet, primarily due to the impact of generic competition. Positively impacting results, Xarelto sales grew 40% on a sequential basis, contributing over 2.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. ","On the pipeline front, we had a number of approvals during the quarter. ZYTIGA was approved by both the FDA and the European Commission for the chemo na\u00efve indication. SIRTURO, to treat pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis, was approved by the FDA. ","The FDA approved the expanded use of Xarelto to treat deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, and pulmonary embolism, or PE, and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial treatment. And, the FDA approved PREZISTA 800 mg tablet and just last week it was also approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.","Additionally, during the quarter, as an update on filings, the NDA was submitted to the FDA for Canagliflozin Metformin six-dose combination therapy to treat patients with Type II diabetes. The supplemental biologics license application for STELARA, for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis, was submitted to the FDA, and the type II variation to the EMA. In the U.S., the two structural damage claims for Simponi will not be pursued at this time, given other priorities.","And, a decision was made to withdraw the EMA application for Simponi IV for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA, pending additional manufacturing data, which would be unavailable within the current EMA review timeline required. We plan to resubmit a marketing authorization application for the IV pharmaceutical forum with this additional manufacturing information. We anticipate having greater clarity on a potential resubmission timeline during the first quarter of 2013.","That completes the review of the pharmaceutical segment. I\u2019ll now review the medical devices and diagnostics segment results. Worldwide medical devices and diagnostic segment sales of $7.4 billion grew 14.9% operationally as compared to the same period in 2011. Currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points, resulting in a total sales increase of 13.7%.","Sales, excluding the net impact of Synthes, were up 0.8% on an operational basis, with U.S. sales down 2.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.2% on an operational basis. ","Now, turning to the MD&D businesses starting with cardiovascular care. Cardiovascular care sales were down 5.2% operationally with the U.S. down 2.6% and sales outside the U.S. down 6.6% operationally. Excluding the impact of drug eluting stents, worldwide sales were flat on an operational basis. Endovascular sales declined versus the same period last year, due to competitive pressures and the impact of the supply disruption earlier in the year that was resolved late in the third quarter.","Biosense Webster achieved worldwide operational growth of nearly 14% in the quarter, driven by strong market share growth. The success of the THERMOCOOL catheter launches made strong contributions to the results. ","During the quarter, the FDA also approved the S.M.A.R.T. Control vascular stent system for use in the superficial femoral artery. The diabetes care business operationally declined 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the U.S. business down 10.6% due to the impact of mail order, lower price, and private label competitors.","The business outside the U.S. grew 5.2% operationally, with strong sales in emerging markets partially offset by lower sales in some of the developed markets. ","The diagnostics business declined 3.3% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 7.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 1.3% operationally in the fourth quarter. Sales were impacted by lower clinical lab sales and the divestiture of the RhoGAM business during the third quarter.","Infection prevention grew 4.9% on an operational basis, with sales in the U.S. down 8.5%. In the U.S., a customer program to upgrade systems to STERRAD systems ended in the first quarter, impacting the timing of capital purchases for the year. Excluding capital sales, U.S. growth was approximately 9% in the quarter. ","Sales outside the U.S. were up 13.6% operationally due to strong consumables growth driven by the breadth of the installed base. Orthopedics sales were up 65.1% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2011. ","Excluding the net impact of Synthes, and the divestiture in December 2011 of certain neurosurgical instruments, sales grew approximately 3.5% on an operational basis with similar results both in and outside the U.S. ","Operationally, hips were up 6% worldwide, driven by 7% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were up 4% operationally, driven by the growth of cemented stems, heads, and acetabular products.","Knees worldwide increased 4% on an operational basis, with the U.S. up 7% driven by fixed bearing and revision platforms. Sales outside the U.S. were up 1% with growth in Asia and Latin America, partially offset by softer sales, primarily in Europe, due to competitive pressures.","Including the Synthes business in both periods, and excluding the divested DePuy trauma business in both periods, trauma grew approximately 1% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 4% and sales outside the U.S. up 6% on an operational basis. U.S. growth was impacted by a supply disruption.","Including the Synthes business in both periods, worldwide spine was down 3% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down approximately 7%, impacted by continued softness in the market as well as the restructuring of the commercial sales organization. Outside the U.S., sales grew approximately 4% operationally. ","Specialty surgery achieved operational growth of 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012. U.S. sales were down 0.3%, with lower sales of energy products due to competitive pressures and the impact of reprocessing. This was offset by strong growth of biosurgery products and additional sales from the acquisition of SteriMed. Sales outside the U.S. were up 9.5% on an operational basis, due to strong results for energy and biosurgical products.","Surgical care worldwide sales were flat on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 3.3% and sales outside the U.S. up 1.9% operationally.Increased sales of endoscopy products with the success of the (Ashalon) flex powered endopouch stapler were offset by lower sales in mechanical products due to shifts, demand (inaudible) and procedures and pressure from low-cost competitors as well as lower sales in pelvic floor repair products and breast care products.During the quarter, the FDA approved EVARREST Fibrin Sealant Patch, a novel product that rapidly and reliably aids in stopping problematic bleeding during surgery.Rounding out the review of the medical devices and diagnostics segment, our Vision Care business achieved sales growth of 6.4% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.Sales in the US increased 7% while sales outside the US increased 1% on operational basis. Growth was driven by daily lenses and the stigmatism lenses.That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter of 2012.It is now my pleasure to turn the meeting over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?Alex GorskyThank you very much, Louise. She always delivers that with a great deal of precision and consistency, a lot of numbers, a lot of nomenclature but thank you very much for that great start, Louise.I want to thank all of you for participating in today\u2019s meeting. So whether you\u2019re with us here in New York or you\u2019re logged into the webcast, welcome. I think you will agree that 2012 was a very important year for Johnson & Johnson.In spite of many challenges around the globe and our market, meaningful innovation, the breadth of our businesses and the extraordinary achievements and the dedication of our people drove solid business results for the enterprise.And as we enter 2013, I believe we\u2019re well positioned to sustain and drive growth in this increasingly dynamic global healthcare market.Now, I\u2019m very pleased to be with you here today to review our 2012 business highlights and to provide you with an overview of the healthcare market, including some of the dynamics and trends affecting our industry and then I\u2019m going to review our strategic outlook for 2013 and beyond.Now, later today, the leaders of our MD&D segment were going to update you on their respective businesses and most of you know our MD&D meeting was postponed. It was originally to have taken place last fall but, unfortunately, Hurricane Sandy disrupted that plan.And while in this case the storm may have caused a delay in having us review our plans and our businesses with you, the devastating impact that Hurricane Sandy had in our region really can\u2019t be overstated.And as expected, our employees sprang into action to help deliver supplies, rebuild communities and, very importantly, we have committed more than $5 million in products and cash to help the region that our company has called home for more than a century.Now on a personal note, I want to say how fortunate I am to be working alongside the many great people of Johnson & Johnson. And as always, I want to start with a comment on our credo.Together, there are more than 128,000 of us around the world with wide ranging responsibilities and capabilities and we\u2019re united by a common purpose. At Johnson & Johnson, we\u2019re committed to caring for the world one person at a time.And it\u2019s a testament to this commitment that more than 1 billion healthcare consumers each day rely upon the use of Johnson & Johnson products. So let\u2019s start by looking at our performance.We delivered on our financial commitments, generating significant free cash flow and maintaining our AAA credit rating. We also advanced our near-term business priorities.First, restoring a reliable supply of our OTC products to the market has been paramount. Key products like Children\u2019s Tylenol and Children\u2019s Motrin return to the shelves and we\u2019re committed to continue building trust in our OTC products.We also made significant strides in the integration of Synthes, solidifying our leadership position in orthopedics and later today you\u2019ll hear from our MD&D leaders on some of their new innovations.And we continue building strong momentum in our pharmaceuticals with REMICADE, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and in INCIVO. We also strengthened our focus on the future by investing in innovation, progressing some of our enterprise initiatives that I\u2019ll take you through and expanding our global presence.So now let\u2019s review our financial highlights for 2012 versus 2011. As you can see, our sales for 2012 increased 3.4% or 6.1% operationally, reflecting the outstanding progress of our newly launched pharmaceutical products, the addition of Synthes, and strong growth in the emerging markets. Now, excluding the net impact of Synthes, operational sales growth was 3%. But with our continued focus on financial discipline, our adjusted earnings were $14.3 billion, up 3.4%. And adjusted EPS was $5.10, up 2%.","We also generated significant free cash flow of approximately $12.5 billion. Importantly, we continued our track record of delivering consistent performance, with 29 straight years of adjusted earnings increases, and 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, making us only one of six companies in the S&P 100 to achieve that record.","You can see our products are making a difference in the care of people around the world, as approximately 70% of our sales come from the number one or number two global market share position. And our commitment to investing in R&D is also paying off, with about a quarter of our sales being generated from products that have been introduced in just the last five years.","The solid shareholder returns are a hallmark of Johnson & Johnson. Founded in 1886 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1944, our commitment to managing for the long term has made Johnson & Johnson a solid investment choice for decades. In 2012, a total shareholder return of just under 11% exceeded the Dow Jones Index.","And although a nice return, it trailed the other indices we compare to, and as we move forward, we\u2019re focused on decisively shaping our portfolio to deliver even more meaningful innovations to patients and customers.","Here are results by segment, reflecting our broad base of leadership in healthcare. Pharmaceuticals generated $25.4 billion, or 38%, of our total sales. It had a strong operational growth rate of 6.8%. Medical devices and diagnostics, our largest segment, generated $27.4 billion, or 41%, of our total. Operational growth was 8.7%.","Excluding the net impact of the acquisition of Synthes in June, operational growth was about 1%. Overall growth in this segment was impacted by our decision to exit the drug eluting stent market and the continued economic pricing and austerity measures within these markets. And our consumer segment generated $14.4 billion in revenue, or 21% of our total. ","Sales grew about 0.5% operationally, reflecting our efforts to address the issues in the OTC consumer business, targeted portfolio decisions we made over the year, and continued pressures in the marketplace. ","In 2012, we generated $19.1 billion in segment pretax profit, and the margin expanded to 28.5%. We also continued to invest for sustainable growth and absorbed additional amortization related to Synthes. And even with that, we leveraged our segment pretax margin. This is a great tribute to our business leaders.","So in summary, Johnson & Johnson delivered solid results in 2012, with momentum continuing to build as sales growth accelerated. Now, let\u2019s move to the segment highlights, and I\u2019d like to start with our pharmaceutical group.","By any measure, we have transformed our pharmaceutical business, demonstrated first by the impact we\u2019re having on addressing unmet medical needs of patients and by our strong growth with sales results of $25.4 billion. Recently approved products are accelerating our growth through the strong launch execution programs we\u2019ve implemented to ensure access and reimbursement. ","In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, ZYTIGA, INCIVO, and [zeplion] transformed our product portfolio. And the most recent IMS data positions Janssen as the fastest-growing among the top 20 companies in Europe. And in Japan, we are the fastest-growing pharmaceutical company among the top 25, having launched seven new products in the last two years. ","In the U.S., we hold the leadership position in total sales of new products launched since 2009. And at the same time, while focusing on that kind of execution, we made significant pipeline advancements and received FDA approval for SIRTURO at the end of December, the first therapy with a novel mechanism of action against tuberculosis that the agency has approved in more than 40 years.Now, given the growing concern and the increasing prevalence of resistant strains of TB, I\u2019m particularly proud the impact that this product is going to have on patients around the globe.And we\u2019re leading the industry with FDA approvals since 2009. Now, great example of the quality of the work that our team is doing is with ZYTIGA, which I was going to discuss with you in just a few minutes. Another is XARELTO.But before I begin talking and discussing individual products, let me share with you another indication of the transformation that our pharmaceutical teams have produced.This graph illustrates our accelerated growth rate in pharmaceuticals over the past 11 quarters. And I want to take a moment to comment (Paul Stopples) and (Wakim Duradco), our worldwide chairmen for the pharmaceuticals and their teams for their vision and leadership in fundamentally transforming our business.XARELTO, it has the broadest profile of any of the novel, oral anticoagulants in the market with six distinct uses and we hope to expand this profile further with a pending indication in acute coronary syndrome.And we are seeing XARELTO capture significant share in the US. There were more than 1 million prescriptions written last year and, according to recent IMS data, XARELTO is capturing 30% of new to brand share in its category and is up more than 8% since the DBTPE approvals in November.We\u2019re also starting to see it cut into the use of Warfarin as well, which is down nearly 8% during the same period.Now XARELTO is also more than double our closest competitor in new to brand share among cardiologists, treating patients with non-valvular afib and is just three percentage points behind Warfarin in the setting.Furthermore, the brand continues to make strong gains with 75% of patients on Medicare Part D and 85% of commercialize now having Tier II access, the preferred co-pay position, of course, for branded products.We have an exciting and late-stage pipeline of differentiated medicines. (Canagiclosin), which has the trade name in (Vocana), is already filed for the treatment of Type II diabetes.And (Simepravere), a TMC 435, is a potential best-in-class protease inhibitor for Hepatitis C that we\u2019re co-developing with (Medavere) and anticipates submitting for regulatory authorization Japan, the US and the EU in the first half of this year.So with our very focused end-to-end strategy in R&D, we\u2019re investing in earlier-stage programs across our five therapeutic areas with the aim to reach leadership positions in each of these categories.This focused approach allows us to position and invest in building leadership capabilities that are very specific to these disease areas. It also helps us attract the best scientists, researchers and collaborators and creates, frankly, a more efficient market approach by optimizing our sales force\u2019s ability to sell more than one product to the same physician.Now let\u2019s talk about our MD&D business. It is the largest medical technology business in the world with sales of $27.4 billion. Sales grew 8.7% operationally with the inclusion of Synthes. And while overall market growth has slowed somewhat, we\u2019ve been focusing on building our market leadership position and has sustained or grown share in the majority of our key platforms holding number one or number two positions in over 80% of them.With Synthes, we\u2019re further expanding our global presence with strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. And as we look to the future, we\u2019re advancing innovative new products in our pipeline, continuing to take a disciplined approach to managing our portfolio and by adapting our businesses to the changing marketplace.We continue to invest for long-term sustainable growth and completed the largest acquisition in our history with Synthes.Now back in June, the (pew) in Synthes joined to form the world\u2019s largest, most comprehensive orthopedics and neurologics organization. The leadership team is a strong combination of talent from the two companies.As all of you know, joining two companies of this size and scale is no easy task. Yet, customer and sales integration has proceeded as planned and there are future synergy opportunities ahead, fully integrating, manufacturing R&D.It\u2019s going to take some time, but in the end we are confident that this endeavor is going to be good for patients, customers and for our business. I\u2019d like to particularly recognize Michel Orsinger and his leadership team at DePuy Synthes, who have done a great job on this integration so far. In addition to Michel, we have an experienced and talented leadership team in Gary Pruden, who leads our global surgery business and Karen Licitra in global medical solutions.","These three seasoned leaders are really shaping the industry\u2019s future by making smart, disciplined portfolio and investment decisions to even further increase our competitiveness in bringing innovative new products and solutions to patients and healthcare providers around the world. You\u2019re going to hear from each of them later today. ","Now, in the past year our consumer business generated sales of $14.4 billion, representing operational growth of 0.5%. And we are the sixth largest consumer healthcare company in the world. And as I said earlier today, we are absolutely committed to returning the consumer business to growth, and we\u2019re starting by restoring a reliable supply of our McNeil OTC products to the market. ","And as with all of our business segments, our investments in growth and consumer will be predicated on a very focused portfolio approach to deliver science-based products with local market insights, professional endorsements, and commercial excellence.","We\u2019ve taken steps to reshape our portfolio, and have divested certain products or brands, and we\u2019re also investing in growth and expansion in emerging markets with market specific brands like Dr. Mom Cough and Cold products in Russia and by leveraging our strong iconic brands like Johnson\u2019s Baby. ","Now, regarding McNeil, we\u2019re continuing to operate in accordance with the consent decree, and we\u2019ve achieved our commitments to date under our work plan, which has been agreed to with the FDA. The work to bring our plants fully online is progressing, and so we continue to take a prudent approach to production volumes.","We will return a consistent supply of key products to the market over the course of 2013, and we will make targeted investments in marketing and commercial support to ensure they regain their leadership positions over that time.","Sandy Peterson, who brings 25 years of diverse global healthcare experience to Johnson & Johnson, assumed her role last month, and is focusing on returning our consumer segment to growth together with Jesse Wu, our worldwide chairman of the consumer group and his leadership team.","So now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the global market dynamics that are driving so much of this change. I think we all know, and would all agree, that there are enormous challenges and uncertainty in the global economy, and frankly in the global healthcare environment overall. ","But we\u2019ve got to break with zero sum thinking, so let\u2019s envision for just a moment a world where creativity and innovation help remake our options. For a better tomorrow, we don\u2019t need just new medicines and new products, we need new philosophies, new approaches, and frankly, a new mindset.","We\u2019ve simply got to reinvent the way we think about healthcare, and patient needs must be first and foremost in this discussion. Now, traditionally, we\u2019ve recognized that in any country, economic growth creates the demand for greater access to better quality healthcare. And what\u2019s also true is that better quality healthcare leads to economic growth. ","So, finding a clear path forward and reforming healthcare is critical to addressing the rising demands on the system, as the population ages, and requires even more healthcare than they do today. We ultimately cannot allow the uncertainties before us to impact the care of patients, and we\u2019re eager to work with others to try to find solutions, and frankly not just with other healthcare companies, but universities, governments, NGOs, communities. ","Beyond the legislative front, healthcare is an industry that is changing rapidly. It\u2019s one of the most important and emotionally rewarding industries in the world. The healthcare market is large, it\u2019s growing. In developed markets, approximately $5.5 trillion were spent last year. And even though compounded average growth rates as a percentage have slowed in these nations, estimates suggest that it will reach $8 trillion by 2022. ","So it\u2019s unquestionably essential that we remain focused on sustaining and expanding our leadership positions in these important markets. Meanwhile, the emerging markets present significant growth opportunities by growing at CAGR rates double that of the developed world. So we are increasingly allocating resources there to establish leadership positions in all of our segments.Rapid expansion of the middle class is increasing demand for better healthcare in places like Brazil, India, China and Southeast Asia.On the other dynamic is people are living longer and they\u2019re more likely to be managing chronic healthcare conditions than ever before. A recently published report in (Lancet) on the global burden of disease showed that for the first time in history soon after 2015 there will be more individuals over the age of 65 than people younger than the age of five.Now, this is really important because people over 65 use an average of seven times more healthcare than younger people. We\u2019re also seeing a decrease in the ratio of economically active people to retired people in many developed and even in some of the developing countries, shrinking the revenue base for health and other public spending and this is an increasingly important issue for healthcare systems that must meet the demand to provide even more quality healthcare.(Inaudible) cancers, mental \u00a0health disorders, diabetes will grow at the fastest rates. And we\u2019ve aligned our businesses, our scientists, to focus on meeting the needs of these patients and markets.And the future will require new approaches to science and technology, new and more innovative ways of delivering healthcare and new approaches to partnerships, collaborations. These types of innovations are essential to enhancing outcomes for patients and potentially bending the healthcare cost curve.And our strategic framework focuses on us being leaders in this evolving healthcare market. You might recall that I introduced this strategic framework in July. It starts, as always, with our credo, which is the very foundation of our business.It defines our values and drives everything we do as a business from day-to-day decisions to long-term planning. It is our aspiration that by caring, one person at a time, we will help billions of people around the world live longer, healthier and happier lives.Now this is an important source of inspiration for our scientists, our business people and all of our employees worldwide. And our four strategic principles are as relevant today as they have ever been.And so here is how we\u2019re putting our strategic framework into action. We\u2019ve identified four growth drivers. And the first I\u2019d like to discuss with you is innovation.Now realizing advancements in healthcare must start with identifying the unmet needs of patients; the patients have got to be at the center. And we believe in creating value in three core ways.First, through our distinct model of innovation; next, by taking a lifecycle approach to building market leading platforms, brands and products; and third, by engaging in broad partnerships with patients, customers, payers to provide solutions and unique offerings that improve access and outcomes. I\u2019m going to explain each of these.Our distinct model of innovation has two key elements. It begins with accessing the very best science and then leveraging our own specialized capabilities to ultimately develop differentiated products.We\u2019re really agnostic as to where the ideas may emanate from and we\u2019ll access the science internally or externally. With skilled, smart scientists in our labs, we\u2019re leveraging our internal capabilities and exploring new approaches that will potentially lead to innovative treatments for things like infectious diseases, more effective skin care products, new ways to restore mobility.And by capitalizing \u00a0on new technologies like predictive modeling tools, bioinformatics and biomarkers, we are able to select compounds that will ultimately have a greater probability of success and development.Now consistent with our approach of sourcing the best science from anywhere in the world, we\u2019ve executed roughly 100 alliances, licensing and acquisitions, collaborations, strategic partnerships across the enterprise last year.And we\u2019ve also established four regional innovation centers as part of a very focused approach to accessing early resource programs. Now, these centers will help us transform our pipelines and will be instrumental in unearthing future products and solutions that are going to drive future growth. The field of oncology is a particularly good example of our innovation model in action. ","Consider for just a moment the unmet medical need here. While cancers today are detected earlier and treated with less toxic, more targeted therapeutics, the case for developing new oncologic drugs is painfully obvious. It is the fastest-growing disease category. ","As I showed earlier, it will continue to increase, unfortunately at alarming rates. That is driving this segment to a $65 billion global market and the category is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 8%, reaching $111 billion by 2018.","In 2008, there were $12.7 million new cases of cancer diagnosed, with 7.6 million deaths. By 2030, an estimated 22.2 million people will be diagnosed with cancer, leading to 13.2 million deaths. ","But as we better understand how cancer cells work, how to interrupt their processes with better and more innovative medicines, diagnostics, and biomarkers, they will improve outcomes for these patients. And ZYTIGA is a great example of identifying the best science. ","As many of you are aware, we acquired Cougar Biotechnology in July, 2009, when the Phase III trials had really just begun. We then executed a comprehensive, full development plan to ensure the clinical studies would fully support the potential of this product and make a meaningful difference to prostate cancer patients.","Now, the good news is ZYTIGA has helped to expand the market, and now in the U.S. approximately 80% of chemo refractory patients seek treatment, which is up from about 40% at the time of launch. ZYTIGA is now approved in more than 65 countries for post-chemo metastatic [unintelligible] resistant prostate cancer, and generated $960 million in sales last year, making it the most successful oral oncology launch in history. ","And, the drug is broadly accessible. Here in the U.S., it holds 100% Medicare Part D coverage and coverage in 98% of commercial lives. We\u2019re very excited. Last month we received an approval on expanded label from both the FDA and EMA, and that will allow ZYTIGA to be used even in the earlier pre-chemotherapy setting, and we are looking forward to continuing to optimizing its lifecycle, developing it in other metastatic prostate cancer settings and for potential use in breast cancer.","Ibrutnib, an oral anticancer compound that we are developing in collaboration with Pharmacyclics for B cell malignancies, is another instance of accessing the best science to serve an unmet need. We\u2019ve seen compelling early efficacy and safety data in multiple B cell malignancies, and have initiated a comprehensive global development program.","Now in addition to the U.S. and E.U., this includes parallel development in China and Japan, and over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve initiated three chronic lymphocytic leukemia Phase III studies and one Phase III in mantle cell lymphoma that is also ongoing, as well as a number of other earlier studies in B cell malignancies. ","The EVARREST fibrin patch exemplifies how we\u2019re leveraging opportunities across our enterprise to create value through innovation for patients within our model of innovation. As all of you know, bleeding is a potential complication of really any surgical procedure, and can pose as a significant challenge to surgeons. Severe, uncontrollable bleeding can raise mortality rates from less than 1% to 20%.","In clinical studies, EVARREST was 98% effective in stopping bleeding and maintaining hemostasis compared to the current standard of care. Gary Pruden will tell you more about this innovation in the surgical technology breakout later today.","So our lifecycle approach considers the needs of the patient. And as we build out platform approaches with brands that endure, and products that can grow and ultimately lead in the marketplace, our immunology franchise is another strong example. ","The worldwide immunology market is estimated to reach $50 billion by 2018. One in six people in the United States suffers from an immune mediated disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, psoriasis, or asthma. People of all ages are affected by these very debilitating, serious diseases that present systemic co-morbidities which impact the ability to function day-to-day, week-to-week.Now, these diseases collectively have a multibillion dollar impact on the entire healthcare system. And while REMICADE and other anti T&F agents have clearly transformed the treatment of many of these diseases, we are aiming to still improve efficacy response rates for these patients.Our leadership platform in immunology begins with the three currently marketed biologics and have achieved nearly $8 billion in sales in 2012. Each of these addresses significant conditions.Now, of course, REMICADE is our foundational pipeline in a product, having received 16 FDA approvals. And we\u2019re also developing (Symphony) and STELARA for expanded uses. (Symphony) is filed in the US and Europe for approval of subcutaneous treatment for ulcerative colitis, in the US as an intravenous therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.We\u2019ve also filed applications in the US and in Europe for STELARA for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and we are running a Phase III trial in (Crone)\u2019s disease.So to sustain our long-term leadership position in immunology, we\u2019ve built a robust, late-stage development pipeline of differentiated biologics that include (Sarucamab) and (Gluselcamab), formerly (inaudible) 1959.And we\u2019re also excited about the novel oral therapies in our pipeline and if this science and immunology evolves, we\u2019re well positioned to continue global growth in this category.So diabetes is another example of how we\u2019re building platform approaches to combat a disease area. Diabetes is a global crisis that no population or country can ignore and the unmet needs are considerable.It\u2019s one of the most common non-communicable diseases globally and chronically affects the body\u2019s ability to metabolize glucose. According to the International Diabetes Federation, an estimated 366 million people live with the disease, 90% of which are Type II. And the estimates grow to over 550 million by 2030.So with our breadth of offerings, we are making a difference and helping people better manage their diabetes from wellness and prevention programs offered by the Human Performance Institute to a no-calorie sweetener in Splenda and with insulin pumps from (inaudible) as well as the new one-touch (inaudible) blood glucose meter from (Life Scan) which, when approved in the United States, will be the first meter to transmit blood glucose results to an Apple iPhone using our one-touch reveal app enabling patients to review and share their results remotely with their caregiver, a real breakthrough.And as you can see, we\u2019re in the process of building a comprehensive platform for the management of diabetes with these products and we\u2019re very much looking forward to adding (Invocana), an innovative example of how we\u2019re approaching the treatment of diabetes pharmaceutically.Now, this is an investigational, oral, one-daily medication offering a unique insulin-independent mechanism of action that actually lowers glucose levels by directly blocking reabsorption by the kidneys.Now studies have shown that (Invocana) is effective across the treatment paradigm. At the highest dose, it provides a statistically superior glucose lowering relative to (Amoril) and (Genuvea) with a low incidence of hypoglycemia. It also contributes to reductions in blood pressure and body weight.Now, given its benefits, its efficacy, its safety profile, (Invocana) has the potential to be the first choice for add-on therapy to (Met Forman). And on January 10th, an FDA advisory committee voted 10 to five in support of the approval and based on the results of our 10,000 patient clinical program.When approved by the FDA, (Invocana) will be the first in its new class of diabetes therapies available in the United States and we anticipate a decision from the agency later this quarter and from EMA in the third quarter.So shifting from diabetes, let\u2019s talk for a few moments about oral care. Now Listerine is truly a flagship brand and a great example of how, with our science, deep insights in the consumer needs around the world, we continue to expand the market with new products by adding claims and professional recommendations.Last year in Asia, we launched Listerine Green Tea, tailored to local tastes, which follows by a year the successful introduce of Listerine Essencial, developed for emerging middle class customers in Latin America. Formulas launched initially in the U.S. like alcohol-free Listerine Zero are now driving market expansion in Europe and the Middle East. And the cycle continues with the recent launch of Listerine Ultra Clean in the United States.","Now, the best innovations in healthcare technology mean nothing if people can\u2019t get them, or caregivers don\u2019t know how to use them, and we want to be part of the solution. And across Johnson & Johnson, we\u2019re establishing broad partnerships that provide unique offerings to patients, insurers, providers, to ensure access to our products and also increase capacity in the overall healthcare system.","Many of you are familiar with the VELCADE program in the U.K., and we\u2019re very proud that thousands of multiple myeloma patients there have accessed this much-needed treatment since the program\u2019s inception. ","In response to the most acute nursing shortage in the history of the United States, we launched the campaign for nursing\u2019s future, to help recruit new nurses and nurse faculty, and we\u2019ve seen enrollment at entry level baccalaureate nursing programs nearly double and the number of young nurses has increased 62%. ","And in France, prior to agreeing to reimbursement, the payers wanted to validate that RISPERDAL CONSTA would actually reduce the risk of hospitalization for patients with schizophrenia compared to other available antipsychotics. So we worked them and we initiated a one-year comparative effectiveness study that showed RISPERDAL CONSTA reduced the risk of hospitalization by 34%.","This is a win for everyone. Patients are able to be treated with a very effective medication that improves their quality of life. We are fully reimbursed. And this has had a neutral impact on the French healthcare system due to the actual savings that they get by reducing hospitalizations.","And just in December, we expanded ZYTIGA-1 support, a multichannel adherence program with an award-winning educational component that has already helped improve access and compliance for thousands of prostate cancer patients in the United States. You\u2019re going to hear more about this program as well as other innovative partnership programs Janssen has been involved with around the world during our pharmaceuticals review that will take place in May of this year.","And later today, you\u2019ll see how LifeScan and Animas are working with Aetna and Kaiser to help drive value and outcomes in diabetes, and how in orthopedics we\u2019re partnering with the AO Foundation to increase access to training programs for surgeons around the world. And you\u2019ll also have the chance to learn more about other programs when you visit the technical displays outside in the ballroom during the breaks later today. ","Now, I\u2019ve talked some already about the importance of emerging markets. Here\u2019s a closer look at our global reach and local focus approach. As the world has changed, so has the geographical distribution of our businesses, employees, products, and sales. Today, 56% of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s revenues come from outside the United States compared to about 40% just a decade ago. ","Now, we traditionally talk with you about BRIC markets, which comprised nearly 10% of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s total revenue in 2012. Yet the broader, emerging markets are increasingly important, approaching a quarter of our sales today, reflecting double digit growth in 2012 on an operational basis inclusive of Synthes.","Now to meet the demands of the emerging markets, the ability to capitalize on our broad base of product offerings and critical mass, it really positions us well with customers and with governments. And we\u2019ve established and expanded our presence in global markets. We\u2019ve leveraged our global portfolio, we\u2019ve selectively acquired new products that are really tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. And I\u2019ll show you how we\u2019re doing that in China in just a minute.","To support our business approach, our regional companies have also optimized their infrastructure, and we\u2019re continuing to invest and support dozens of institutes around the world, designed to train healthcare providers on the effective use of our products. For instance, our San Paolo Institute in Brazil trains nearly 3,000 healthcare providers annually.","An example of our commitment to offer localized healthcare solutions is also evident in India, where we\u2019ve opened a DePuy Institute. Approximately 1,000 physicians a year are trained there in the latest orthopedics techniques and technologies to help ensure that patients get the quality care that they need and that they deserve.","Now, the work that we\u2019re doing in China really illustrates how we\u2019re building our businesses in important emerging markets. There are about 1.4 billion people in China and the majority are covered by some form of insurance but increases in healthcare expenditures are estimated to run to a 20% plus CAGR through 2016.As their economy grows and more people enter the middle class, there\u2019s a rising demand for a broader array of better healthcare solutions. And while many companies are talking about expanding their businesses in China, at Johnson & Johnson, we\u2019ve been there for 27 years and we employ about 9000 people.Our China business generated nearly $2.5 billion in sales last year, driven by diverse and expanding portfolio of brands that Johnson & Johnson is known for globally as well as those that we\u2019ve acquired to meet specific local need and demand.We have seven major manufacturing facilities in China. Our (inaudible) plant is equipped with world-class capabilities and produces over 240 million packaging units of high-quality pharmaceutical products that supply 26 countries with benchmark cost efficiency.Our sutures plant in Shanghai provides raw materials in semi-finished silk to the US, Europe and South America where we then complete production.We have a major new innovation center in (Sujo) and I had the pleasure of attending that opening myself. The center is supply medical device and diagnostics products specifically for the S2 market in both India and China.And these products are targeted at specific disease space that are more prevalent in the region and they include simplified or smaller devices that are better suited for use outside the major cities in the top tier hospitals as well as multiuse products or even disposable products that are more economical.We already have a number of these products on the market: staples, sutures, a blood glucose meter, an artificial knee, but always know there\u2019s much, much more work that needs to be done.And as we seek to bring the promise of good health to as many people as possible, we know we\u2019ve got to do more.And as you can see, our portfolio of offerings is diverse and expanding and includes iconic brands from our Johnson\u2019s Baby and our Neutrogena franchises. Important pharmaceutical products such as REMICADE and INVEGA SUSTENNA have grown strongly in the market and they can be aided by (Resalor) and (Adorant) which are approved there late in December and also by (Symphony) and STELARA, which we expect regulatory decision on later this year.We\u2019re also conducting research and development in the new medicines that will address specific needs in China and, in fact, across all of Asia. Just this last May, we acquired (GuanJu) biofuel biotech which is the only approved (porcing) plasma-derived (fibrant) sealant on the market in China. This acquisition will expand our biosurgery business there.Now, we know the model in China works and we\u2019re applying it to other countries as well. So let\u2019s move now to our third growth driver, execution.Excellence in execution is extremely important. Across our enterprise, we have built greater accountability for quality into the requirements of all of our leaders. It has strengthened quality and compliance at the enterprise level by taking specific steps to reduce variation and increase governance.We\u2019ve also redefined standards and processes in the Johnson & Johnson supply chain to, most importantly, improve the level of execution and to deliver efficiencies that can free resources up for investment.Our recent productivity in pharmaceutical R&D leaves the industry and our model for executing the launch of new pharmaceuticals is best in class.In MD&D we are changing the way we sell our products here in the US by rolling out a new go-to-market strategy that Gary and Michel will walk you through later today. And we\u2019re making decisive leadership decisions with respect to our investments.As I\u2019ve discussed with many of you before, there are many opportunities for us to pursue in managing our portfolio and we must \u2013 we must be more decisive and deliberate about our investment choices, the main focus on accelerating our growth and driving greater value.Now, while we\u2019ve invested considerably in growth opportunities, we have also exited businesses such as drug-alluding stents, and divested products and brands in each segment, including several in our consumer business as well as the professional wound care, (cogman), (theracose) and (rogan) business in MD&D.Now, as we looked at our portfolio, relative to our growth drivers, we\u2019ve also made a decision to explore strategic alternatives for our ortho clinical diagnostics business. We will be exploring all options, including a possible divestiture, where OCD could have greater potential from operating as part of another organization whose focus is more closely aligned with its core strengths, or as a standalone company.","In evaluating these options, we will also strive to maximize shareholder value. We continue to believe that diagnostics is important to the future of healthcare. We remain committed to exploring ways in which diagnostics can fuel our growth, such as the work we\u2019re doing in companion diagnostics that support our pharmaceutical pipeline as well as the point of care diagnostics that you\u2019re going to hear more about today.","Our OCD business has made, and we expect it will continue to make, significant contributions to the field of clinical diagnostics, whether or not it remains within Johnson & Johnson. OCD plays an important role in healthcare, and meets an important demand in the marketplace, with excellent product offerings.","Again, I want to reiterate that we are initiating the first steps of an exploratory process. There\u2019s much more work to be done. In the meantime, it\u2019s going to be business as usual. Our employees will continue to focus with their passion and expertise on meeting the needs of our customers and the patients they serve.","I now want to touch briefly on our views about leading with purpose. We take our responsibilities as a leader in healthcare very seriously, and we\u2019re fortunate to be in an industry where human healthcare is the very basis of our business. And we measure success by improving the quality of people\u2019s lives.","First, the most fundamental obligation in health is to expand access to care for people everywhere in the world. This is core to most healthcare reform efforts, but it\u2019s also essential. To help address the HIV epidemic in the world\u2019s poorest countries, we\u2019re allowing generic drug manufacturers to responsibly produce generic versions of PREZISTA, expanding access to this important medication. ","We\u2019re also fully committed to working with health authorities around the world to make SIRTURO available to assist healthcare professionals in the fight against multi drug resistant tuberculosis, and we\u2019re going to make sure that we manage distribution in an appropriate manner to ensure and maintain this efficacy.","Our commitment to transforming the lives of patients and communities includes our contributions of about $900 million in products and cash last year, in support of over 600 programs that address major health related issues in local communities in more than 50 countries around the world. ","We\u2019ve also made great progress toward our Healthy Future 2015 sustainability goals, as well as against our goals to reduce water consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and waste disposal. Initiatives such as these help the entire world.","Now, all of this is possible because of the passion and the conviction of our people who are the driving force behind everything we do at Johnson & Johnson. Our commitment and resolve to global citizenship with an engaged global workforce, coupled with the scale and the breadth of our company, positions Johnson & Johnson to deliver sustainable growth for the long term.","And our financial strength, breadth of products and services, our global footprint and commitment to global citizenship, positions Johnson & Johnson to drive growth in today\u2019s dynamic global markets. And with our credo as a foundation, we\u2019re delivering on our commitments to patients, employees, communities, and our shareholders, and we\u2019re committed to achieving our financial targets, which we will meet by executing against our near term priorities and our growth drivers.","Thank you very much. I\u2019m now going to turn the program over to our CFO, Dominic Caruso, to provide some additional comments on our 2012 performance and guidance with respect to 2013. Then we\u2019ll go into our Q&A session. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Thank you Alex, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some comments on our 2012 fourth quarter and full year results, as well as provide guidance for you to consider as you update your models for 2013.","It is a great pleasure to report solid financial results for 2012, a year where we also saw many successes that positioned us very well in the marketplace. At the beginning of 2012, I provided you with an outlook of our financial performance for the year. Specifically, we guided to net income margin that would remain at approximately the same level as in 2011, but that operating margins would improve over 2011 by 100 to 150 basis points due primarily to improved leverage across all operating expenses.As a reminder, we updated our original guidance in July 2012 to include the impact of the Synthes acquisition, including the incremental amortization expense and we forecasted that with good expense management we could still achieve that same 100 to 150 basis point improvement in operating margins.With the completion of the divestiture of our (Varicose) business late in the fourth quarter, the other income and expense line resulted in a higher net gain for 2012 than the guidance we had provided in October.As has been our practice, we take the opportunity to redeploy those types of gains in higher growth areas with additional investments in the business. This additional gain was offset by additional R&D expenses related to the licensing and collaboration deals we entered into in the fourth quarter, such as the collaboration with (Astellas) for the development of a new (jack) inhibitor and milestone payments to other collaborations that have advanced in our pipeline.Even with these additional investments and the incremental amortization expense associated with Synthes, I am pleased to report that we did improve operating margins by 100 basis points.Also, although we are pleased with the passage of the legislation to renew the R&D tax credit retroactively for 2012 and prospectively for 2013 under the American Tax Hire Relief Act, the credit is not included in 2012 results since the legislation was not passed until 2013.Therefore, our effective tax rate for 2012 did not benefit from this credit as we had assumed, yet I am pleased to report that we were able to implement other tax planning strategies that resulted in our effective tax rate coming within the guidance we had provided.Now, during the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items. These special items amounted to approximately $1 billion on a pre-tax basis and consists of the following.We increased our reserves for litigation and program costs associated with the (Depew) ASR (HIP). As we disclosed previously, changes to the accrual would be required as additional information became available.We have taken an impairment charge for in-process research and development in the quarter related to a smaller acquisition we did several years ago where we have terminated one of the development programs.And finally, we continue to record costs associated with the Synthes acquisition which are consistent with what we expected would be incurred as special items throughout 2012 and which we expect will continue although at a lower level in 2013 as we continue to integrate that business.Together, these special items impacted our fourth quarter results by $0.28 per share. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 for the fourth quarter exceeded the mean of the (inaudible) estimates as published by first call.To wrap up our formal presentation this morning, I would like to provide some guidance for your to consider as you update your models for 2013.Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of 2012, we had approximately $5 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $21 billion of cash and marketable securities and $16 billion of debt.For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $500 million.Turning to other income and expenses, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation and divestitures, asset sales or write-offs.This account is difficult to forecast but we would be comfortable with your models for 2013 reflecting other income and expense as a net gain ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, a substantially lower level than what we saw in 2012.And now a word on taxes. For 2012, the company\u2019s effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 21.2%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2013 at approximately 20%. This effective tax rate for 2013 includes the federal R&D tax credit renewed by Congress under the American Taxpayer Relief Act for both 2012 and 2013. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon the rate throughout the year.","Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales guidance for 2013 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected yet in your models. Those key assumptions and factors are: we have assumed that generic competition for CONCERTA will be on the market beginning in early 2013, and along with the impact of generic competition for Aciphex\/Pariet in 2013, we expect that the impact to sales from generic competition will be at the same level as it was for 2012. ","We divested a number of consumer brands throughout 2011 and 2012, as well as that MD&D divestiture that I just mentioned late in 2012, which, of course, impacts the absolute level of sales in those businesses. ","Looking at your models, we noted that the impact of these two items has not yet been totally reflected. If properly reflected, this would have about a 1% negative impact on our growth rate versus many of your models. As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.","We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2013, with the impact that currency exchange rates could have. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we will use the euro as an example.","As of the end of last week, the euro was at $1.33, and it\u2019s strengthened along with several other major currencies versus 2012 levels. Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 5.2% and 6.2% for the year.","This would result in sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $70.7 billion to $71.4 billion. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but as an example, to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates for all of 2013 were to remain where they were as of the end of last week, our sales growth rate would increase by nearly 0.3%. ","Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to range between 5.5% and 6.5% for a total expected level of reported sales between approximately $70.9 billion and $71.6 billion. ","And now turning to earnings, our guidance reflects the following major assumptions. First, the implementation of the medical device excise tax. This has an incremental negative impact to earnings per share of $0.05, and will be recorded in cost of goods sold. ","It is important to note that the overall impact to Johnson & Johnson of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act in 2013 is estimated to be the equivalent of $1 billion of cost, or approximately $0.25 of earnings per share. While this is a significant cost, we remain committed to the principle of providing broader access to healthcare for all Americans.","We will have a full year impact of amortization related to the Synthes acquisition of approximately $550 million on a pretax basis, or an incremental half year negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.06. Our estimated 2013 earnings include total intangible amortization expense for the entire enterprise of approximately $1.4 billion on a pretax basis.","We expect to continue to incur costs in 2013 at a similar level as we did in 2012, related to the ongoing implementation of our approved work plan for the remediation of the McNeil OTC manufacturing facilities, consistent with the consent decree. ","We expect to experience pricing pressure in 2013 across many markets, particularly in Europe. The impact of this negative pricing pressure is expected to negatively impact our operating margins by approximately 50 basis points. ","And finally, with respect to our shares outstanding, I\u2019ve noticed that in many of your models you expect a lower share count than we are projecting to have. As a reminder, in connection with the financing of the Synthes transaction, we had implemented an accelerated share repurchase through Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.Until those two investment banks complete buying back those shares in the open market, we cannot engage in the share repurchases, even for shares issued in connection with our employee stock plans. We expect this program will be completed by the middle of this year.Now considering the factors I just noted, we suggest that you consider full-year 2013 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.30 and $5.40 per share on an operational basis or a growth rate of between 4% and 6% on a constant currency basis.We are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an impact of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates for all of 2013 were to remain where they were as of the end of last week and our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share due to exchange rate fluctuations.We, therefore, suggest that you model our reported EPS, excluding special items, in the range of $5.35 and $5.45 per share or a growth rate between 5% and 7%. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.And finally, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you will see that we do expect that operating margins will show a slight improvement in 2013 over 2012 levels.We also expect that overall net income margin will be approximately the same as in 2012 as we expect to achieve net income growth consistent with sales growth despite the incremental impact of a full year of amortization expense related to the Synthes acquisition, the pricing pressure that I mentioned and, of course, the impact of the medical device excise tax.Additionally, as a reminder, we expect to have significantly lower level of gains in the other income and expense line as compared to the prior year, so we recommend that your models reflect that lower level in the first half of the year.Now in closing, we\u2019re very pleased with the overall results for 2012 and we expect the continuation of the growth and momentum into 2013. We have the financial strength and breadth to execute on our near-term priorities and deliver solid results on continuing to invest in growth by following our four core growth drivers.We are confident in the underlying strength in our business as evidenced by strong core products, exciting new product launches, robust pipelines and extraordinary global expansion opportunities.I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year and now I\u2019d like to turn the program back over to Louise to begin the Q&A session. Louise?Question-and-Answer Session","Louise MehrotraThank you, Dominic. We\u2019ll now open the floor to your questions. As we have Alex with us, I would appreciate if you\u2019d keep your questions at the strategic level and please wait for the microphone as we are webcasting this meeting. So (Mike), right here? \u00a0(Mike)?Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorganSo two questions, Alex and the first is you\u2019ve identified the OCD business as one to evaluate today where you said you\u2019d be exploring strategic options. Could you spend a minute on why that business first? \u00a0You said there was a lot you could potentially do with the portfolios. Why was that business necessarily, call it, first on the list?And then second, you showed a great chart which showed a turn in the pharma business over the last couple of years. Can you \u2013 since we\u2019re going to spend the day today talking about MD&D, can you spend a minute on consumer and how we think about the turn in the consumer business over the next couple of years with (McNeal) products coming back and what gets that back into a growth phase?Alex GorskyLet\u2019s start first with OCD and let me first start by making a strong statement by our continued commitment to our employees in OCD and what they\u2019re doing each and every day to make a difference for healthcare around the world, let alone in Johnson & Johnson.And as we talked about a number of times in the past, as we look at our strategies, as we look at our portfolio, we realize that it\u2019s more and more important, particularly in today\u2019s healthcare marketplace, to be very decisive and deliberate about where we believe we can make investments that, number one, make the biggest difference for patients and, number two, that can drive the greatest growth for our business.And as we conducted a portfolio review, looking across our enterprise, when we looked at diagnostics, what we see is a business with many very good technologies. We also saw a business that did not have a number one or number two position within their respective marketplace. ","We also look, obviously, at the future pipeline. Could we, in fact, and did we see a path forward to be able to be in a more competitive position. And three, how did we see it fitting in a more complementary way with some of our other businesses. ","And while we certainly believe in the future of diagnostics, we think that that will more likely be in an area outside of clinical diagnostics such as molecular diagnostics, biomarkers, some of the other things that we\u2019re already working on with some of our oncology programs. ","So when we looked at that in total, we felt that stepping back and looking at broader strategic options for that business was, in fact, the best thing to do for that business longer term, as well as for more broadly across Johnson & Johnson. ","And I also just think it\u2019s indicative of the need for us to continue to look for ways, again, to make a better difference for patients and to drive growth in our organization.","Now, to your second question, if I look more broadly across consumer, I\u2019d start by saying that we remain very committed and excited about the future of our consumer group. It\u2019s been essential to J&J for many, many years, and as we look to the future, there\u2019s a couple of aspects that I think are very important.","One, and something that we\u2019ve been extremely consistent about over the past several years, is returning and repairing some of the quality and supply issues that we\u2019ve had in our OTC, particularly in the McNeil U.S. division. ","I\u2019m very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in that. We mentioned to you that the consent decree that we had designed in conjunction with the FDA was approved and reviewed in October, with very few comments. And given the breadth and scale of that agreement, we felt very good about that. We\u2019ve had teams working hard since then. We\u2019ve achieved all of our major milestones since we\u2019ve submitted that agreement. ","And very importantly, we\u2019re starting to see some of that pay off in the marketplace. So over the past six months, we\u2019ve seen the reentry of things like Children\u2019s Tylenol, Children\u2019s Motrin. And what we\u2019re particularly pleased about is that if you look at some of the consumer ratings, the quality of those brands, we\u2019ve seen them be remarkably resilient through this period. And when we get them back to the market, we see an uptake occur. ","So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Our plan through 2013 continues with this driving performance, consistent with the consent decree. We would expect that over the course of 2013 to return about 75% of the brands to the marketplace. ","And of course as we do that, we will also begin shifting our focus, not only from making sure that we can have a consistent and reliable supply of that product, but also that we can truly relaunch, working with our trade partners, working with our great marketing teams, to reestablish those brands and their leadership positions in the market. And we\u2019ll do that as the brands reenter over the course of 2013. ","And let me just make one other comment. We are also very pleased to see, particularly in the fourth quarter, the upper respiratory strong performance of our consumer brands. So we believe that we continue to have a lot of skills and capabilities that are going to be important for us to continue to build on going forward.","Now, outside of the OTC business, I think there\u2019s a lot of other reasons to be optimistic. And granted, as we looked at the results, we\u2019d be the first ones to say while we\u2019re pleased in some areas, we\u2019re not satisfied, and we know we need to do a better job across the portfolio. ","Also, some of the results were impacted by the divestitures and portfolio decisions that we made in our consumer group. But when we look at some of the core areas, such as skincare, our Neutrogena business, and some of the things that they have in cytomimic, wrinkle reduction, other technologies, really science-based technologies, and what we think we can do there. ","If you take a look at things like oral care, where we\u2019ve driven strong growth, great opportunity to build on that brand Listerine in a global fashion. When we look to an opportunity to expand and grow our business globally, particularly in emerging market - and we admit we\u2019ve seen some setbacks in China due to some of the ingredient issues - but our teams have addressed that of the past year, and we\u2019re confident that we have a path forward. ","And finally, and last but certainly not least, our Johnson\u2019s Baby line, which is really an iconic brand, that we still know has a lot of potential. We see it as an important driver of growth in the future. ","And I think for 2013, to be clear, our projections are very consistent with many of yours. But beyond that, our consumer group remains a very important strategic driver at Johnson & Johnson. ","Louise MehrotraNext question, Matt, fourth row.Matt Dodds \u2013 CitigroupProbably a little for Alex and Dominic on this one \u2013 if you look at the \u201913 guidance, the out margin increasing next year, this year you got a lot of that SG&A but I would assume you also did bring down some cost in the gross margin.If you look at \u201913 broadly, should we assume it\u2019s mostly SG&A or is there more cost on the cogs line in 2013? \u00a0And I\u2019ll wrap into a question for Alex.Dominic CarusoSo Matt, yes, we did see actually in \u201913 a pretty dramatic reduction in SG&A costs \u2013 sorry in \u201912. In \u201913 we won\u2019t have as significant of an overall pre-tax margin expansion as we saw in \u201912 but we\u2019ll still expand these operating margins, some again in the SG&A line, not so much in the R&D line but we will see cost improvements kick in in the cogs line in 2013.Matt Dodds \u2013 CitigroupThen Alex, just to follow up on that, with the US still sluggish in devices and consumer, can you pull out enough costs over the next couple years to maintain the margins in that business?I know you\u2019ve done some restructuring changes in some of the sales force, some things. Where do you look at the profits in the US if we don\u2019t get a bit of a balance in the overall growth rates?Alex GroskyThat was your question specifically for consumer or \u2026Matt Dodds \u2013 CitigroupNo, it\u2019s overall but I think MD&D and consumer are the two where you\u2019ve seen the weakest pharmas come back quite well.Alex GroskyRight, well, certainly the macroeconomic situation is something that influences, I believe, our medical device business and our consumer business to a greater degree. And as we look at some of the underlying dynamics in the market, and some of these metrics, of course, we talked about with you in the past.If we look at hospital admissions, if we look at surgical procedure rates, if we look at things such as diagnostic rates in hospitals, in even primary care physician visits, most of those categories appear to be about between minus one and plus one depending on the specifics, like negative 4.4 plus 0.7.So what we\u2019re projecting is likely for a pretty flat trend to continue in the short term and I think it\u2019s varied that we have to work our way through what happens with some of the fiscal discussions here in the United States. That\u2019s very difficult to predict and I don\u2019t think any of us would try to make a projection on that going forward.I think beyond that we still see a lot of reasons to believe in underlying growth. And as procedures are delayed and \u2013 in certain areas, by the way, we are very pleased with some of the resurgence that we saw, for example, in the hip and knee categories, especially in the fourth quarter here in MD&D and (Michele) is going to take you through that later on.But as you\u2019ve heard in Louise\u2019s discussion earlier, we saw a 7% growth rate in the US \u2013 or excuse me, worldwide we saw that 7% and 4%, 6% on a worldwide basis. So we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve been seeing there and particularly pleased with that team because I think that there were some significant challenges and they seemed to be making some really good headway.But I think overall at MD&D we would expect there to be continued pricing pressure. In consumers, in the consumer area, again, I think a lot is going to depend on the macroeconomic environment, but I would get back to some of the drivers that I mentioned as part of my last response to say why we\u2019re still optimistic about that area going forward.Louise MehrotraNext question, Larry, second row on the side here.Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells FargoOne question for Dominic, one for Alex; Dominic, the contribution from Synthes in 2013, is it similar to 2012, about 3%? \u00a0And the reason I\u2019m asking is because your guidance, if it isn\u2019t similar would be about 2% to 3% organic growth, which would be a lot lower than what we saw in the second half of 2012.I understand the generic impact but you do have consumer potentially coming back, (Doxil) potentially coming back, so is the math right and why the conservatism is that\u2019s what it is in the guidance?And then one for Alex; just your US businesses in the fourth quarter all seem to have slowed a little bit. Were they specific issues to change or is there anything in the US market that you saw?And then just lastly maybe an update on Europe, just the state of Europe from your big picture perspective.Dominic CarusoThe impact of Synthes is about the same in both years. I think therefore your observation is that the growth rate ex-Synthes is also similar. And a couple of points on that. One is that yes, the consumer business is coming back, although, as Alex mentioned, throughout the year so, you know, take some time. ","By the time all those products get back on the shelf, the MD&D business will do better in 2013 than in \u201912. And the growth rate in the pharma business, of course in \u201912, was dramatically fueled by the launch of the new products that came into the market, so the growth rate in \u201912 versus \u201911 is impacted by that, and we don\u2019t have that same phenomenon in \u201913 over \u201912. ","Those products continue to do well, but relatively speaking, compared to the two years, the growth rate in pharma would be not as dramatic as the growth rate we saw in \u201912 over \u201911. You asked about why the conservatism, and look, it\u2019s early. You know, it\u2019s January 22. So we\u2019ll keep you posted throughout the year. ","Alex Gorsky","Larry, thanks for the question. What I would say is if we look at the U.S. business, particularly in the back end of the year, as you noted I think it started strong with our pharmaceutical business. We saw very strong performance, and particularly in our launch brands: XARELTO, ZYTIGA, with some of the new indication information, data that was being released. But really across that portfolio, even the immunology as well. Very strong performance.","As we look at MD&D, we did have some challenges in certain areas of our business. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that. Some of them due competitively. Some of them due to some disruptions in supply. But I would characterize those as, I think, more event-driven versus systemic in nature. And I think you\u2019ll hear later today from Gary and Michel and Karen about their pipeline, about their competitiveness, about some of the very innovative programs they\u2019re driving, that you\u2019ll walk away confident with the plans that they have in place. ","And just a couple of things I would note there. One was we\u2019re really starting to see a pickup in our vision care business. For example, in the fourth quarter this year, as you heard, 6% and 7% growth respectively. We\u2019ve got a very exciting portfolio there, and so we\u2019re excited about opportunity. And as I just mentioned a couple of minutes ago, in Synthes in particular, in core hip and knee business, we also saw some strong performance. ","And remember, offsetting that in orthopedics, in Synthes, we did have the nail recall in trauma, which was, again, more event-specific than, I think, longer term. And I really think that the DePuy Synthes team has done a great job in managing that. In fact, by later in the quarter, very early in January, we had product back in the operating rooms, and we\u2019re real confident in our ability in managing that going forward.","Now, if I look at consumer, there were some areas of softness that, again, we think were more related to some regulatory actions earlier in the year related to our Skillman facility. But if we look more broadly, and we look at things like our OTC performance - and again, this was a business that\u2019s been under a significant amount of pressure, in a very competitive category. And to drive the kind of growth they did in upper respiratory, we\u2019re really proud of that team. And oral care, also, turned in a strong performance as well.","So as Dominic just mentioned, we look at all of these markets right now, given the macroeconomic issues, and we have to be realistic. But nonetheless, I think overall the trends that we mentioned we think are manageable, and you\u2019ll see that as performance grows in 2013.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Rick?","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","First, for Dominic, and then for Alex, Dominic, both you and Alex have mentioned the seemingly better performance for ortho. Just can you help us understand, is it product driven? Is it comps? Was there any difference in selling days? It seemed like a nice step up versus the the quarter.","Alex, a broader, bigger question for you. I\u2019m always fascinated by leadership and change in leadership. Every leader brings a special passion and differentiates themselves versus their predecessors, no matter how excellent. Today, you\u2019re talking about decisiveness, many opportunities to manage the portfolio, technology. Can you help us understand how we should be holding you accountable, or thinking about your plans, or what\u2019s truly a special sauce, if you will, you\u2019re going to bring to the job?","Dominic Caruso","Alex will comment on the orthopedics business, as will Michel later. But just a reminder, we haven\u2019t seen all of the orthopedic companies report yet, so we\u2019re pleased with our results. A little too early for us to in the cape that we\u2019ve gained share or not. But certainly these results are impressive and our early indications are that we have done better in share in both hips and knees, especially in the US but a little too early to comment on that given the fact we haven\u2019t seen the other competitors yet.Alex GroskyIf I could (augment) onto that, again, (Michele), the true expert, can jump on this later. But I think if we look particularly in knees, we\u2019re seeing the market come back a bit more than in hips right now. I think Dominic\u2019s points are spot on and that we believe, although we haven\u2019t seen everybody else report, so it\u2019s preliminary that we performed well in both those categories.We saw knees come back a little bit more than hips but fundamentally we think that if you look at our product offering, too, that we have, you\u2019re going to hear more about a new knee system that we\u2019ll be launching through the course of 2013 with the tune.We brought a number of new offerings in our hip portfolio out there, so we think it\u2019s a combination of one, some return to the market. And some of it was what I call was the fourth quarter dynamic in orthopedics that you sometimes as see as people waiting until the end of the year. But overall, we\u2019re encouraged by the signs that we saw in the back end of 2014.And regarding the broader agenda, Rick, I think that I\u2019ve been very fortunate in taking over a great organization from Bill and his leadership and it\u2019s really not about my agenda. It\u2019s about the agenda of the great leaders that we have sitting out in front of you and when you consider the scale, the breadth and the depth of our business, it\u2019s far beyond one person.It really takes a team of great minds working together. And what I\u2019m particularly pleased about is that there is a strong recognition of wanting to, what I\u2019d call, respect the past and the great heritage that we have with many of our brands in our portfolios but there\u2019s also a real recognition on this team and a hunger for what do we need to do fundamentally differently to drive growth going forward around patients and our business?And that became the foundation for the strategy review that we pulled together looking hard at innovation in recognizing that while we have a good track record in innovation, the market\u2019s going to demand us to do ever more.And whether it\u2019s Paul Stoffels and his team, (Martin Madden) and his team and others that we have going, that throughout our portfolio, our ability to bring technology to market that really makes a difference that has the right clinical data around it, including (alchems) data, to innovate in the way that we commercialize our products in the market.You\u2019re going to hear a lot of information about that this afternoon is that we fundamentally believe that as customers experience the pressure \u2013 when I say customers, it can be governments, it can be hospital systems \u2013 of this increasing demand and increasing costs in a challenging economic environment that they\u2019re going to be looking for fundamentally different ways of engaging with partners.And we think that\u2019s where the breadth and the scale and the depth of our portfolio across areas such as orthopedics, such as general surgery, such as diabetes, such as immunology is going to better position us by having a broader, more comprehensive offering than, frankly, any of our customers.And you\u2019re going to hear a lot more specific examples of that this afternoon and, in fact, in the coming weeks and months because we want to be part of the solution and work in healthcare but we also want to be competitive and we\u2019re going to win and so that\u2019s part of our mindset.I think the second component of that is global. And we\u2019re spending a lot of time focusing on how can we accelerate our growth outside the United States? \u00a0You heard the figure earlier, 56% of our sales are currently outside the US. We know we have even greater growth opportunities beyond just the brick markets but would say overall the emerging markets, hence greater investment in those areas, as well as different kind of product offerings in many cases.And clearly those two things being topped off with a major focus on execution and leading with a purpose that really inspires our people.Louise MehrotraKristen, fourth row from the back here, (inaudible). Up here.Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche BankAlex, I just wanted to focus a little bit on the portfolio banishment. Obviously today the question was already asked on OCD but maybe you could just help us a little more broadly about how you think about J&J and just looking at the portfolio.Through the past there\u2019s been references to adding in a fourth leg. I know Dominic has mentioned that before, which seems to not necessarily be the case. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s changed. And other times, they appear to talk about things like microelectronics, life science tools, structural hearts. I don\u2019t know if [I care] is also of interest in expanding in solutions, but maybe you could just help us think about J&J as you\u2019re going forward, looking at strategic alternatives for OCD, what the appetite for M&A might be in 2013 and beyond.","Alex Gorsky","Thank you for the thoughtful question. I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent in the way we\u2019ve articulated our strategy around M&A. You know, first really starting with where is there unmet need where we feel we should or can be a part of the solution. And that can start with great technologies, that can start with great companies, and there are examples of both that we\u2019ve had historically, that resulted in us going out and acquiring something new.","I think more and more we\u2019re looking at the second aspect, of how does it fit in a complementary way with our other businesses, as part of making a broader offering, similar to what we\u2019re seeing now in Synthes, and our vision. And so we\u2019re always looking for businesses that can complement, just don\u2019t replicate, but truly complement and synergize, with some of our existing businesses or some of our platforms.","I think the other area that we\u2019re also acutely aware of is how do we drive additional growth globally, particularly in emerging markets. And we\u2019ve done that, I believe, in a disciplined and selective way so far. And I mentioned the recent acquisition we did in China to expand our biologics platform. ","But here we\u2019re very excited about the patient and the business opportunity represented by our biosurgical franchise. And it\u2019s another example of where we started with a product, a technology, and we\u2019re building an entire platform to reshape the way that the bleeding is controlled. ","And an important component of that is not only to do that in developed markets, but how do we do that in developing markets? How do we source the right kind of capabilities? So by doing this in China, we think that\u2019s going to give us a great opportunity. We\u2019ve done it in our consumer group, with some of the products I mentioned in Russia, Dr. Mom. ","So that\u2019s an area where we realize that if we only rely on endogenous growth in some of those markets, we won\u2019t accelerate at the rate that we\u2019re hoping for. That being said, we need to be very thoughtful about which companies, and how we go about it, in some of those markets. Those are a few examples of, I think, areas of interest for us.","Louise Mehrotra","Tony?","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital ","Alex, one for you and then two quick ones for Dominic please. Alex, I\u2019m just curious if we could just go back to comments you made earlier about Washington, and not knowing which way the wind blows there. And I think we all would agree, but what is your view of the dual eligibles? And do you think there\u2019s a resolution in the near term? ","And then Dominic, just two brief questions. One on VELCADE. Could you discuss the tenders, and what happened in this particular quarter, Q4, and also comments around the flatness sequentially in ZYTIGA?","Alex Gorsky","Look, our approach all along has been that it\u2019s very important to make sure that as we work our way through healthcare reform, that we stay focused on solutions that do improve or provide access for people who are either un- or under-insured in this country. And we think it\u2019s unacceptable there\u2019s such a high number, and so we\u2019ve tried to work very closely with our trade organizations, with governments, to make sure that patients can get access. So we think that\u2019s important, number one.","Number two, specifically as it relates to dual eligibles, we try to work with our trade partners at pharma, with the government, in good faith, toward the additional ACA, and we think that by and large, that program run, Medicare Part D, has been very successful. And we just need to be aware that as we make commitments, as we create programs, that we do so in a way that leads to a consistent approach, and number two, that ensures we continue to reward innovation. ","Because if we don\u2019t reward innovation, we\u2019re not going to have the next ZYTIGA, we\u2019re not going to have the next ibrutnib, and some of these wonderful compounds. And by only focusing on costs, we will not cure Alzheimer\u2019s, we will not take care of diabetes in the way that we should. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re very anxious to work with a lot of other partners on coming up with the way that we\u2019re preserving this underlying encouragement and motivator for innovation, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on. ","Dominic CarusoWith respect to VELCADE, the only thing that happened there is that typically the tender process would have called for a new tender in the early part of 2013 and actually was accelerated by the Russian government into 2012, so it was just an earlier tender and we won that tender, so we actually had the sales benefit from that in the fourth quarter.And then ZYTIGA, the flatness can be described \u2013 can be attributed really to the patient assistance program that we initiated so that patients that can\u2019t otherwise afford ZYTIGA for prostate cancer can still have access. If we don\u2019t get underlying scripts, the scripts are still growing.Louise MehrotraOne final question from David up here and then we\u2019ll have some closing remarks from Alex.David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley(All I have) Alex, is one for you. You talked extensive innovation in your prepared remarks and for the last several years there\u2019s been this big debate about what J&J spends on R&D as a percent of pharmaceutical sales and whether that number should be 15% or 20%. It\u2019s huddling around 20%.It sounds like, if we think about your comments innovation, should we expect that level of R&D for pharmaceuticals, Alex, to remain around that 20% level and maybe a quick comment. Can you just talk about the total corporation, how you see R&D spending under your leadership?Alex GroskyAnd I\u2019ll keep it at a fairly high level and then Dominic, you can take it in deeper. But we believe that innovation continues to be absolutely critical to our success going forward. And if you take a look at our investment that we made in the pharmaceutical business, for example, over the last several years, I think we make a pretty compelling case that we\u2019ve seen the results of that based upon the transformation that we\u2019ve had in our pharmaceutical business.Now, that being said, we realize that it\u2019s also incumbent upon us to be as absolutely efficient as we can be as well as being effective. And Paul and his team have done I think a remarkable job on that side as well as I talked about if you look at some of the efficiency indices that are out there right now on a per patient basis, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of managing that end because we realize that that\u2019s critical for us as well.In our other groups, we also realize that, look, we are going to be under increasing pressures, whether it\u2019s on a pricing perspective or from our markets and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken some of the actions that we have.So Gary, Michel and Karen are going to take you through some of their ideas later on where bringing together (Epicon) and (Epicon endosurgery) the way that we did we think will provide us not only with a better ability to continue to invest in innovation and differentiation but also, frankly, better serve our customers and respond to some of the demands that they\u2019ve had, and Michel, in a very similar way.And the other thing that I would add onto innovation that I think makes us unique and is a real opportunity is this opportunity around conversions as well. The biosurgery business is a wonderful example but in every one of our businesses, we\u2019ve got examples now, again, diabetes we talked about commercially but also some things scientifically.We\u2019ve got other things that we\u2019re working right now in the whole biosurgery area and there\u2019s a number of opportunities for us to work across J&J that I think allows us to not only build better capabilities but leverage scientific capabilities better than many of our competitors.Dominic CarusoJust an additional comment, the R&D spending is at the higher end of the industry norm, although there are other innovators in pharma that also spend at that high level. So we view ourselves as an innovator in pharma and, for that, you should expect us to be spending at the higher level.And quite frankly, with the productivity that our R&D organization and pharma has been able to deliver, that\u2019s a fantastic investment from my point of view.Overall for the enterprise, we tend to average an R&D spend as a percent of sales hired in our competitive set blended. Again, that\u2019s a much more capital efficient way of growing our business and as long as that\u2019s productive we\u2019re happy to invest at higher levels that our competitors.We then have to find ways to fund that and you saw that that\u2019s what we did this past year by the significant reduction in the SG&A cost. So as long as our R&D is productive and we can bring innovations to the marketplace, we\u2019re happy to spend more than the industry in that regard and obviously, then, hopefully grow at a rate faster than our competitors as well.Alex GroskyWell, everyone, I\u2019d like to end where I started earlier this morning and really thank all of you for participating in today\u2019s meeting. As I said during my talk earlier, I think our strategic framework, our broad base of product offerings, critical mass, really positions Johnson & Johnson well to drive growth in today\u2019s dynamic market. ","And this year we\u2019ll continue delivering innovative new products and solutions for consumers, for patients around the world, by implementing the long term priorities that we outlined, as well as our short term priorities. And I look forward to updating you on our progress against them as we move through the year. So I\u2019d like to say, thank you again, and turn it back over to Louise. ","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you Alex and Dominic, and we will now take a short break and resume at 11 o\u2019clock. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Joseph Wolk","Hello. I am Joe Walk, Vice President of Investor relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company\u2019s review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. ","Joining me on today\u2019s call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and Dominic Caruso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson.","We are very pleased with our 2017 fourth quarter and full year results. Once again, the performance illustrates a track record of consistent growth exceeding financial expectations and making progress on our long-term strategies. ","As we guided this time last year, sales for the business accelerated in the second half of 2017, based largely on the strength of our Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices. 2017 also marked a year in which we complemented our existing portfolio with significant acquisitions and many collaborative agreements. ","These are some of the factors that contributed not only to our superior total shareholder return for 2017, but the more than 225% returns since the end of 2011 exceeding major indices, as well as our competitor composite over that span. ","As we enter 2018, we are confident that our Pharmaceutical business will remain strong and anticipate our Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve resulting in solid financial performance, while delivering innovations that will have an enduring impact on patients, caregivers, and consumers.","A few logistics before we get into the details.

Dominic will conclude by providing insights on the income statement and our guidance for 2018. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last 90 minutes. Now, on to our results. ","Worldwide sales were $20.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 11.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, sales increased 9.4%, as currency had a positive impact of 2.1%. ","In the U.S., sales were up 9.8%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 9%, as currency favorably impacted our reported OUS results by 4.5 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 4.2% worldwide, 4.1% in the U.S. and 4.3% outside the U.S.","For the full year 2017, consolidated sales were $76.5 billion, an increase of 6.3% compared to the full year of 2016. Operationally, full year sales grew 6% with currency having a positive impact of 0.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 2.4% worldwide, 1.6% in the U.S. and 3.3% outside the U.S.","Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, there was a net loss of $10.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was a loss of $3.99 versus earnings of $1.38 a year ago. As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, the company did record a provisional charge of $13.6 billion for recently enacted tax legislation, which is treated as a special item. ","In response to requests many of you had after our third quarter call, and to facilitate a transparent understanding of special items, we have included on our website a schedule that details special items labeled Net Income and Diluted EPS GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. ","Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74 representing increases of 9.5% and 10.1% respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.7%.","Regarding the full year, 2017 net earnings were $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share were $0.47. 2017 adjusted net earnings were $20 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $7.30, up 6.8% and 8.5% respectively versus the full year 2016 results. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7.6%. ","Dominic will provide additional details about earnings in his remarks. ","Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on quarterly business segment sales performance highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.","While not part of the prepared remarks for today\u2019s call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2017 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. ","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion, growing 0.4%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 0.2% worldwide. The Beauty franchise grew 2.4%, driven by U.S. share gains in body and hair care attributable to new products, Maui Moisture and OGx within our Vogue portfolio and gains in ecommerce.","This growth was partially offset by increased trade promotion spending for NEUTROGENA products. Over-The-Counter Medicines grew globally 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Growth of 6% outside the U.S. was driven by strong performance in upper respiratory, primarily driven by TYLENOL and BENADRYL in the Asia-Pacific region and the RHINOCORT acquisition.","The decline of 3% in the U.S. is largely due to the fourth quarter 2016 restocking we commented to last year regarding retailer inventory reductions earlier that year and some minor supply disruption we faced following Hurricane Maria out of a Puerto Rico facility, which has now been fully remedied. ","Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care down 2.4%, continues to be impacted by new entrants to the market. As communicated in the past, despite remaining the market leader, we are actively working on relaunching these brands in 2018 and you will hear more details regarding this at our May 16th Business Review Day featuring our Consumer and Medical Device segments.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $9.7 billion grew 15.5% excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, an acceleration of growth over the third quarter of 2017. The therapeutic area with the strongest growth was in oncology at 36%. In Oncology, DARZALEX grew 82% versus the fourth quarter of 2016 and surpassed $1 billion in sales for the year.","DARZALEX continues to increase U.S. market share in lines two and three, and experienced market growth in the line four plus setting. OUS sales were driven by strong uptake in the EMEA and LATAM regions. IMBRUVICA grew 45% worldwide, driven largely by higher market share and market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. and strong uptake outside the U.S. in the EMEA and ASPAC regions. ","In the U.S., based on third quarter data across all lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 5.5 points of market share and the CLL market, based on third quarter data grew approximately 14%. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth was also significant led by U.S. growth of 61% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. ","Clinical data from the d LATITUDE study continued to drive both market growth and market share. The total metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer market is estimated to have grown 25% in the quarter and market share for ZYTIGA at 37% is four points higher than the same period last year. ","In Immunology, the U.S. market is estimated to have grown approximately 9%. STELARA in the U.S. gained two points of market share in total Immunology and 11 points in the Crohn\u2019s Disease market versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Approximately, one-third of STELARA\u2019s fourth quarter sales are in the newer Crohn\u2019s Disease indication. ","One other note on STELARA, growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately ten points in the U.S. related to additional rebates associated with prior quarters in 2017. As we discussed in the past, actual rebate claims do experience a time lag and original estimates for prior quarters required an adjustment due to the rapid utilization uptake we are experiencing with STELARA for the Crohn\u2019s indication.","REMICADE in the U.S. declined more than 8%, as we continued to compete in the phase of biosimilar entries. While this is more of a decline than the modest levels of erosion we experienced during the first three quarters of 2017, demand was relatively stable and the erosion was primarily driven by negative price. REMICADE U.S. export and international businesses declined as erosion from biosimilar competition persists in key markets.","To conclude Immunology, we are very pleased with the uptake of TREMFYA launched for moderately severe to severe psoriasis in the third quarter of 2017. Sales totaled $47 million in the fourth quarter and the product is already the new to brand share leader when accounting for both IMS Claims Data and internal data on samples. ","In Neuroscience, the Paliperidone long-acting products performed well with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency for INVEGA SUSTENNA and TRINZA in the U.S. and TREVICTA outside the U.S. ","My comments regarding results for the pulmonary hypertension assets acquired from Actelion in mid-2017 are on a pro forma basis. This therapeutic area grew 3% globally, 12% in the U.S. and declining 8% outside the U.S. Strong demand for UPTRAVI, which also benefited from a wholesaler inventory build and OPSUMIT was partially offset by two items, first, the expected decline of TRACLEER outside the U.S. due to generics and second, the transition of patient assistance foundations.","Within the cardiovascular and metabolic therapeutic area, INVOKANA declined 34% in the U.S. Similar to prior quarters; the primary driver of the decline is increasing discounts. There was also a loss in share of approximately one point. ","XARELTO\u2019s growth of almost 19% was the result of increasing total prescription market share, up almost 2.5 points versus one year ago. Warfarin continues to decline in favor of branded products. ","I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $7 billion, growing 6.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted sales growth was 2% worldwide. Operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in Vision Care and Cardiovascular, as well as improving growth in surgery.","However, Orthopedics performance was below where we aspire to be, and we continued to decline in diabetes care. Strong Vision Care results were driven by contact lenses, which grew 6% globally in the fourth quarter as the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day portfolio and new variance of the ACUVUE DEFINE had strong adoption.","On a pro forma basis, the Vision Surgical business grew approximately 5%, driven by the continued uptake of Tecnis Symfony in the cataract IOL category. Underlying demand for cataract business approached double-digits for the quarter. Electrophysiology within cardiovascular grew almost 20% worldwide, which is the ninth consecutive year of double-digit growth for that business. ","Atrial fibrillation procedures are estimated to have grown approximately 13% worldwide. Our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters are responsible for modest share gains. Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew globally 14%, primarily driven by strength outside the U.S. from uptake of new products in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We are also experiencing some benefit to the fourth quarter OUS growth from a competitor\u2019s supply disruption. ","Biosurgery grew approximately 8% worldwide, largely due to performance in topical absorbable hemostasis products. In General Surgery, suture growth was more than 4.5%. Barbed sutures are experiencing strong adoption and new World Health Organization guidelines recommending our Plus suture product drove performance in China, India and Japan. ","Specialty Surgery declined 4.3%, as the Infection Prevention and Aesthetics businesses underperformed versus the competition. Within Orthopedics, we are disappointed with the year-on-year declines in the knee and spine businesses as we continue working to improve portfolio offerings in faster growing segments of those markets. ","Hip growth of above 2% appears to be slightly ahead of our projected market growth for the fourth quarter. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories in Orthopedics, but was largely offset by favorable mix. For the quarter, U.S. price inclusive of mix was negative 3% in hips, U.S. price inclusive of mix for spine, trauma and knees were all positive at 3.9%, 1.4% and 0.8% respectively. ","We were often asked about utilization in the U.S. hospital setting, so let me conclude the Medical Device segment providing that information. For the third quarter, we saw a slight decline in hospital emissions of about a 0.5%. Surgical procedures were down approximately 3% and lab procedures were up about 2%. Our preliminary estimates for the fourth quarter indicate the same rates for surgery and lab procedures with admissions improving to flat.","That concludes the segment sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s fourth quarter 2017. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter including the agreement with Legend Biotech for a CAR T-cell therapy candidate for the treatment of multiple myeloma. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex.","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We are pleased to be here sharing the strong results we delivered for 2017. Not only did we exceed the financial performance metrics we set at the beginning of last year resulting in superior returns for our shareholders, but we also delivered on the commitments and responsibilities defined in our credo.","Total shareholder return for 2017 was more than 24%, which is exceptional exceeding our competitor composite, as well as exceeding most major indices. ","And not only is that true for 2017, but I am proud to say that this is also been the case for the last three, five, ten, and 20 year periods. Our shareholder return for 2017 is indicative of the strength of our business, as well as the strategic focus and execution that our leaders and teams have delivered over the past several years.","Our Pharmaceutical business has been an industry leader in all performance measures including R&D productivity and continues to deliver strong top-line growth while simultaneously increasing investments to further develop our incredibly strong pipeline of innovative new medicines. ","Our Medical Device business continues to refine and accelerate its pace of innovation, while also implementing novel commercial models to meet evolving marketplace demands. In our Consumer business, despite a global category slowdown in 2017, we maintained our 2016 share gains in many major categories and improved adjusted income before tax margins further, while also investing in our products via traditional platforms in newer digital vehicles.","As you have heard me say before, while we are pleased with our recent performance, we are not satisfied. Going forward, we are committed to meeting the full potential of both the Medical Devices and Consumer businesses. Our track record of strong shareholder returns is also the result of our approach to managing for the long-term. ","Our relentless drive for innovation, our disciplined portfolio management and our capital allocation strategy, all of which are regularly discussed as part of our ongoing strategic planning with our Board of Directors. We believe that sustaining investments and innovation is the most important aspect of our strategy.","In 2017, we achieved record levels of investment. We invested $10.5 billion in research and development, and $35 billion in M&A, which resulted in a number of value-creating acquisitions and collaborations including Actelion, the company\u2019s largest acquisition to-date, which added a sixth therapeutic area to our Pharmaceutical business and Medical Optics, which continued to fuel growth and establish leadership in the eye health space. ","In total, we completed 16 acquisitions and licenses of various sizes, 60 innovation deals and made 21 new investments from our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation during 2017. In 2018, we will continue to enhance our status as a preferred partner being agnostic to where the best science and technology resides and aggressively pursuing transformational innovation. ","We understand that ideas come from everywhere and the collaboration is a critical step in unlocking new treatments for patients and solutions for our consumers and customers. A great example of this is our collaboration with Legend Biotech, a company in China that we are partnering with to develop a truly breakthrough investigational CAR T anti-cancer therapy for multiple myeloma, which remains an incurable disease for many patients.","CAR T cells are an innovative approach to eradicating cancer cells by harnessing the power of a patient\u2019s own immune system. We are excited to combine our expertise in multiple myeloma with the emerging biotech industry we are seeing in China and we are hopeful that by applying shared knowledge and expertise we can work on building regimens aiming for our tier.","We kicked off 2018 with our announcement of 15 new collaborations to drive the development of novel solutions that can impact healthcare. They focus on addressing areas of unmet need and include exciting new areas such as the use of AI to detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease earlier, identifying throat cancer through a simple saliva test and harnessing the microbiome to treat sleep disorders.","As our portfolio evolves through innovation, acquisitions and growth initiatives, we also regularly evaluate each of our existing businesses to determine if they still fit our strategy and our criteria for value creation. As a result, and as you\u2019ve seen us do, when it makes sense we undertake a process to consider different ownership for a business might be value-enhancing or if a business might be a better fit in another company\u2019s portfolio.","This process also ensures that we continue to invest in the most promising areas of our portfolio where we believe we can make a significant difference for patients and consumers and create greater value for our shareholders. ","In 2017, we announced that we\u2019re evaluating our strategic options for businesses. In addition to continuing this work, we executed four divestitures in 2017 including the Codman Neurosurgery business. Although we made these strategic divestitures, we strengthened our commitment to stroke treatment as evidenced by the launch of CERENOVUS. ","This portfolio includes aneurysm coils, vascular reconstruction devices and other technologies used in the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms and stroke, a market we see growing faster than the average in Medical Devices. Our activity reflects our capital allocation priorities which have remained consistent and we believe proven. ","After funding our internal growth initiatives, R&D and SG&A, our estimated free cash flow for 2017 was $17.8 billion. Our next priority in our capital allocation strategy is delivering a competitive dividend to our shareholders and in 2017; we paid $8.9 billion in dividends which has increased for the last 55 consecutive years. After meeting our dividend goals, we target value-creating M&A and major licensing deals. ","And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as share repurchase programs, and given our financial strength, we have the demonstrated ability to do all of these things simultaneously. ","Over long periods of time, more than half of our free cash flow has been returned to shareholders. As the world\u2019s largest, the most broadly based healthcare company; we understand the important role we play in leading responsibly and representing our industry with integrity. ","As I think back on how far we\u2019ve come, the investments we\u2019ve made in healthcare innovation have yielded some amazing returns. We are in the final stages of creating the first vaccine for HIV AIDS and we are driving towards the end of the vertical transmission of AIDS in Africa. We are winning to fight against drug-resistant tuberculosis.","We are enabling important breakthroughs against pulmonary arterial hypertension. We are advancing spinal care for patients who suffer from debilitating disc disease with our interventional spine technology. We enabled enhanced ability and mobility in knee replacements via novel joint reconstruction technology. We offer the convenience and ability to utilize acne care treatment technology at home. ","We are enabling consumers to digitally scan their skin via a smartphone app and receive in alerts as to provide personalized skin care advice and product recommendations. We are delivering ecommerce vision care solutions that enable consumers to manage their eye care online. ","Clearly, we have a track record of producing advancements in healthcare that saves and improve people\u2019s lives for over a century and people depend on us to continue making new discoveries. We\u2019ve recognized this. We also recognize that we must find new solutions, faster than ever before. I believe that to drive the change in healthcare space that people want and need, we must have a sense of urgency.","This requires us to actually re-imagine Johnson & Johnson as a 132-year old startup, one that embraces and acts on the best ideas that is nimble and fast, that leverages technology to drive life-changing and life-saving innovation and one that focuses on being competitive always via transformative products, quality services, and transparent pricing, all with the consumer top of mind. ","It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be in the business of healthcare. Cures and treatments reaching the market today are not only improving the quality of life for many patients, extending life for others, and contributing to the productivity of our society, but they are also helping to reduce caregiver burden and healthcare spending in other parts of the system such as hospitalizations.","Healthcare is a monumental part of each and every one of our lives. It affects all of us in a deeply personal way, whether it\u2019s our own health or the health of the loved one, and healthcare is equally important and significant from an economic standpoint. It accounts for 18% of U.S. GDP. The pharmaceutical spending is one widely discussed component accounts for about 14% of the overall healthcare spending in the U.S.","As such, it\u2019s important to be clear on how we view our responsibility for the patients and stakeholders served by our products. We believe that investing in innovation to focus on unmet medical needs that create differentiated products to ultimately help people live longer, healthier and happier lives is our first responsibility. ","We believe a more value-based healthcare system has tremendous potential to improve the health of populations, increased access to care, and limit cost. We are working with others in the healthcare system to transform the way healthcare is paid for. So everyone involved is held accountable for the value they deliver. At the same time, we are taking steps in today\u2019s system to advance a more value-based approach. ","We have entered into a number of value-based contracts and we continue to explore new opportunities such as outcome-based contracts, which are tied to clinical endpoints as well as contracts that share risk with managed care organizations and contracts tied to offset other healthcare expenditures. We are also committed to responsible pricing. ","When we price a new medicine, we consider the value of the patients and society, the importance of maintaining affordable access to medicines for people who need them and the importance of preserving our ability to develop future groundbreaking cures and treatments. ","As our 2016 Janssen U.S. Transparency Report demonstrated, we have maintained responsible approach to pharmaceutical pricing generally limiting our aggregate annual price increase to single-digit percentages below those of our competitive set. ","For 2017, the net price for pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is negative, a topic you\u2019ll see more details on when we issue our 2017 U.S. Transparency Report later this quarter. Transparency is just one of the ways we can demonstrate how serious we are about responsible pricing. We look forward to continuing our work with government officials, our customers and other stakeholders to ensure we continue to provide differentiated, value-based and affordable healthcare to people around the world.","Healthcare reform is a major public platform and we remain proactively engaged in this discussion. To be clear, we support Bipartisan steps that will expand access to affordable healthcare and improve long-term sustainability of the U.S. Healthcare System while fostering a competitive market and incentivizing R&D investments behind new treatments, innovations and cures.","From our view, there is several areas for possible Bipartisan agreement, some of which include, the continued funding of cost sharing reduction payments, strengthening the insurance risk pool, and allowing state flexibility. Outside the U.S., healthcare systems are evolving as well and we will continue to be the champion for improving patient outcomes, and investing in healthy societies around the world.","We know that when governments invest in healthcare, they see return on that investment in the form of worker productivity, economic growth and stability. We are pleased with the final passage of legislation to modernize the tax code for American businesses, which can further jumpstart the economy and fuel job creation and that\u2019s good for all Americans.","Some of the elements included in the package are provisions that will allow companies like Johnson & Johnson to have greater flexibility and how we can use overseas earnings to invest for the future, improving the abilities of companies like ours to bring these resources into the U.S. and elsewhere fuels growth and ultimately strengthens the company overall.","Changes to corporate tax rates will help improve the overall competitiveness of U.S. companies. The tax modernization effort moves the U.S. closer to a territorial system and we believe that is good for the economy. ","Finally, in terms of direct benefit to Johnson & Johnson, we believe as the world\u2019s largest healthcare provider one of the most meaningful deployments of the benefits from the most recently enacted tax legislation is to invest in innovation to address significant unmet healthcare needs for society and we plan to do just that by making increased investments in innovation with the intent to have those substantially made in the U.S. while benefiting the globe.","In just a few minutes, you will hear more details from Dominic on the new U.S. tax legislation and the direct impact on Johnson & Johnson. ","As the healthcare system landscape continues to evolve, so too does our business. But despite these changing dynamics at an enterprise level, we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives. In the near-term, we are focused on meeting our financial and quality commitments, keeping our credo obligations that everything we do must be of high-quality, quality is paramount across Johnson & Johnson and it\u2019s worth noting the great progress we\u2019ve experienced with our supply chain over the last few years improving quality, optimizing costs and leveraging capabilities globally that enable further innovation in all parts of our business and help us operate from a position of strength.","In terms of our financial performance, we expect each of our three business segments to continue to grow and contribute to our sales and income growth in 2018. We recognize the importance of innovation in all that we do and innovation will continue to be at the heart of our efforts to meet the needs of patients and consumers. ","We are well positioned to continue to lead the way, leveraging both internal and external resources to execute our strategies. And our commitment to innovation is highlighted by the fact that Johnson & Johnson ranks among the top five companies in the U.S. and the top ten companies globally for R&D investment across all industries.","We have not only demonstrated our commitment to driving innovation from an investment perspective, but we\u2019ve also demonstrated solid productivity that has resulted in positive patient and consumer outcomes as exemplified by our pharma business. ","In our Pharmaceutical business, our priorities remain fairly consistent with what we stated in recent years. We will drive continued growth while delivering on our near-term pipeline. We will do this by focusing on our six therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need, a robust innovation engine and strong commercial capabilities. ","For 2018, we expect our key catalysts for growth will include, expanding the profile on key life-saving and life-changing products, such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA and STELARA enabling a best-in-class uptake of TREMFYA, which was approved in last July in the U.S. ","And last November in the EU; the continued contribution of Actelion sales; securing regulatory approval for Apalutamide in the U.S.; submitting NMEs and line extensions which include esketamine, Erdafitinib, and Apalutamide in the EU six significant line extensions including OPSUMIT CTEPH.","We are on track with launching the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline. In 2017, TREMFYA was approved for psoriasis. In 2018, we expect approval for Apalutamide and we will file for the approval for esketamine in treatment-resistant depression. ","In addition, we expect to file for the approval of seven more products by 2021 for a total of ten, like we told you last May, each with more than $1 billion peak revenue potential. Although we\u2019ve had particularly strong performance in pharmaceuticals, we realize that we have more work to do in further accelerating the Medical Devices and Consumer businesses. ","Our near-term priority in Medical Devices is to accelerate growth through innovation, portfolio management and new business models. We continue to strengthen the foundation and simplify operations. ","We are also reshaping our business and portfolio in anticipation of and in response to dramatic changes the industry and our customers are experiencing, which include aging populations, increasing chronic diseases, health system consolidation, alternative sources for healthcare and increasing expectations of patients related to pricing, products and efficiency.","2017 was a transition year. We stabilized and invested in the commercial organization, improved quality, execution and competitiveness, filled many critical portfolio gaps, and built new platforms, services, and digital solutions. ","Our goal is to continue the top-line acceleration we saw in the second half of 2017 through 2018 and we plan to drive that growth by, building world-class commercial capabilities across the portfolio; globalizing our operational footprint and talent; developing robotics and digital surgery solutions for orthopedics, surgery and interventional; maximizing new market growth opportunities and platforms such as stroke and in care delivery locations beyond the hospital; delivering a forward-looking pipeline to meet consumers\u2019 eye health needs across their lifetime and building a premium surgical channel of superior intraocular lenses; and offering competitive capital equipment platforms in both cataracts and refractive.","While we are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in our Medical Devices business, we know there is still a great deal of work ahead of us to ensure that we are poised to consistently deliver value in 2018 and beyond. ","And in our Consumer segment in the near-term, we will concentrate on enhancing our leadership and priority categories by focusing on critical geographies and our iconic mega brands. ","Our plans for Consumer growth in 2018 include, broadening the scope of our innovation model with breakthrough global platforms, such as the light-based pain therapy device, continuing steady growth in Aveeno Baby, rapidly expanding ecommerce and scaling perfect store, building our portfolio through insight-led innovation that delivers superior science and differentiated products that are professionally endorsed and relaunching the Baby franchise with new formulations and new packaging to meet the purchasing preferences of millennial parents.","I am confident about the strategies that our Consumer business is putting in place, but we also recognize that to drive value and lead in the market, we will have to stay focused, continue to evolve our capabilities, and deliver solutions that drive growth. These compelling strategies and strong results would not be possible without our talented, diverse and dedicated employees around the world.","Today, we employ approximately 134,000 global employees with more than 43,000 jobs right here in the U.S. Our purpose-driven, credo-based culture puts people first and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees. We believe employers have an opportunity and responsibility, as well as an incentive to ensure their employees are healthy and engaged.","Our goal is to lead by example by cultivating the world\u2019s best, healthiest and most engaged workforce from programs that encourage healthy eating movement resilience, to ensuring the financial health of our employees through competitive compensation programs, as well as providing important benefits to support healthy families. ","We believe these programs help us achieve our goals of attracting, developing and retaining the best talent to deliver the best outcomes, positioning us to deliver another 132 years of strong and continued growth and shareholder returns. ","I am also pleased to share another important accomplishment that was recently announced on this front. Johnson & Johnson has once again made the Fortune Most Admired Companies List for 2018. I\u2019d say with great pride that we are ranked in the top-20 and we are the number one pharmaceutical company worldwide on the list.","We are proud of the results we delivered, not just in 2017, but over the past several years, and we will continue working to earn your confidence by meeting and exceeding your expectations of us in 2018 and beyond. ","And, I am equally pleased and proud to share that we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Johnson & Johnson credo this year. Our credo dates back to 1943, authored by Robert Wood Johnson II, the son of one of the founding Johnson brothers right before Johnson & Johnson became a public company. At that moment, J&J\u2019s moral compass as a company was formally documented and that has sustained us for the last 75 years.","Our credo is part of our DNA. We live into the responsibilities that outlines each and every day which enables us to deliver shareholder value and at the same time, strive to change the trajectory of health for humanity. ","So as I travel around the world, meeting with our employees, customers, partners, government officials and world leaders, I am constantly reminded that the astounding pace of change we are experiencing in healthcare, as well as the ongoing technological, cultural, political, and social demands that influence decisions we make in this space. ","And I truly believe that no company is better positioned to lead profound change during this dynamic era than Johnson & Johnson. I am both humbled and honored to have led this company for the last six years and while I am proud of our history, I know we will do even more to deliver life-enhancing products and services of the highest quality to people around the world in 2018 and beyond.","I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I will now turn it over to Dominic who will provide additional details about our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2018. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Thanks, Alex and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve heard from both Joe and Alex, we are very pleased with our 2017 performance. Our full year performance reflects the acceleration of sales growth in the second half of 2017 as we expected, largely driven by the organic growth in the Pharmaceutical segment.","In addition, we are very pleased with the performance from all of our acquisitions including Actelion, and Medical Optics, which have been integrated seamlessly and are performing at or above our expectations. We ended the year at the top-end of our most recent guidance with sales at 6% operational growth for the year. ","With respect to adjusted earnings, we finished at the top-end of our EPS guidance range with EPS at $7.30 per share. Overall, both sales and EPS exceeded consensus estimates. ","Turning to the next slide, you can see our consolidated condensed statement of earnings for the full year 2017. Our guidance from October included an expectation that we would maintain to slightly decline our pretax operating margins on an adjusted basis. ","In looking at your models, it appears that they\u2019ve reflected that expectation. During the fourth quarter, we significantly increased our investment in research and development, which essentially was offset by a higher level of divestiture gains in other income and lower tax rate as compared to your models as I will discuss in just a few minutes.","Therefore, for the full year, you will see pretax operating margin at 25% versus 29.4% the prior year, but this is on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of special items, our pretax operating margin declined 140 basis points on an adjusted basis as compared to the prior year. ","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Our reported sales for the fourth quarter grew 11.5%, 9.4% on an operational basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, our adjusted fourth quarter 2017 operational growth rate was 4.2%, an acceleration from the third quarter.","Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4.8 billion in the quarter, up 9.5% compared to 2016, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.74 versus $1.58 a year ago or up 10.1% and exceeded the mean of analyst estimates. ","Excluding the net impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted diluted EPS was $1.67 or up 5.7% for the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we incurred intangible amortization expense of approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis and an after-tax net charge for special items of approximately $14.6 billion. The largest component of special items this quarter reflects $13.6 billion, a provisional amount for recently enacted tax legislation. The U.S. impact is a provisional $13 billion.","As you know, Johnson & Johnson has long advocated for the modernization of the business tax code. And overall we are very pleased with the new U.S. tax legislation, particularly, the lower tax rate and the ability to access our cash previously retained overseas, now at a reasonable rate. ","The legislation requires a transition tax on previously unremitted foreign earnings even if no longer in the form of cash repaid over an eight year period with a heavier weighting towards the latter years. This amount is provisional as we anticipate further guidance from the SEC and the IRS. ","The remaining after-tax special items included $500 million for litigation charges, $300 million for in-process research and development, and $200 million for ongoing restructuring charges.","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 540 basis points higher than the same period last year. This is due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up charges related to recent acquisitions. Excluding this impact, cost of goods sold was 80 basis points higher than the prior year due to primarily to the mix of products sold. ","Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 29.8% of sales. This is 50 basis points higher than last year as we invested behind the launch of new products. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 18% in the quarter, 340 basis points higher than the prior year, which is mostly related to our collaborative agreements with Idorsia, the R&D spin out of Actelion and Legend Biotech regarding exciting new therapies we are developing.","These higher levels of investments late in the year were offset by higher other income and a lower tax rate in the quarter. Interest expense net of interest income was higher than the fourth quarter 2016 reflecting higher levels of debt and lower levels of cash. ","Other income and expense was a net gain of $9 million in the quarter, compared to a net loss of $20 million in the same period last year. Of course, this line item includes several special items in both years. ","Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of $848 million, compared to a net gain of $220 million in the prior year period reflecting gains from divestitures at a slightly higher level than our guidance for the year, which we redeployed to R&D and selling and marketing expenses as I said earlier.","The adjusted fourth quarter effective tax rate for 2017 was 9%. The adjusted full year tax rate for 2017 was 17.2%, which was below our guidance in October. This lower effective tax rate for the year was lower than our guidance primarily as a result of the increased investment in R&D which I noted earlier. This was incurred at the then higher U.S. tax rate.","It was also lower than guidance due to international earnings mix and lower tax jurisdictions, and higher tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which we saw in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of these previously unplanned items, our normalized annual effective tax rate in 2017 would have been between 19% and 19.5%. ","Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Full year 2017 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise was 31.7% of sales in both 2017 and 2016. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices at 32.7% is higher than the previous year by 50 basis points, primarily due to the divestiture gains, but partially offset by investments in new product launches.","Consumer margins improved by 40 basis points versus 2016, while still making important investments for future growth. We continue to see improvements in our Consumer margins as we\u2019ve previously discussed. Pharmaceutical margins were slightly lower by 30 basis points due to R&D investments that I mentioned previously.","Now I\u2019ll provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2018. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will first give you some guidance on items we know maybe difficult for you to forecast. I would like to first address our cash and debt position. At the end of the quarter, we had $16.2 billion of net debt, which consists of $18.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $34.6 billion of debt.","We are always looking for the right opportunities to deploy our capital to create greater value for shareholders following our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Although we are continuously evaluating external value-creating opportunities in line with this strategy, for purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, we suggest you consider modeling 2018 net interest expense of between $700 million and $800 million reflecting higher levels of new debt incurred in 2017 and lower levels of cash due to the major acquisitions in 2017.","This also reflects an offset for repatriated cash, which avoids further debt issuances. Regarding other income and expense which will be account when we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from litigation and investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs, we will be comfortable with your models for 2018 reflecting other income and expense excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.7 billion to $2 billion.","As is commonly the case, forecasted gains assume various transactions to which we typically don\u2019t comment on for obvious reasons. However, as you know, we actively evaluate and manage our portfolio with the intention of redeploying those gains toward investment opportunities that fund long-term growth.","With regard to pretax operating margins and not including the impact of any special items, we expect to improve margins in 2018 by approximately 100 basis points as we continue key margin improving initiatives in our business. We also expect, as a result of the lower tax rate on U.S. earnings, that we will see increased investment in R&D in 2008, which would mitigate any further operating margin improvements.","And now a word on taxes. As I noted earlier, we are pleased by the final passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. New legislation to modernize the U.S. tax bill for business, which we believe will further jumpstart the economy, fuel jobs and investment and level the playing field between U.S. and foreign headquartered companies. ","Our guidance today includes the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation, although some provisions of the new legislation are subject to interpretation, and maybe clarified by treasury in the near future. The impact of the new tax legislation on our 2018 rate may differ from the company\u2019s current estimate due to among other things guidance that maybe issued clarifying the mechanics of the some of the rules and interpretations and assumptions the company has made in developing this estimated impact.","At this time, we will suggest your models reflect an effective tax rate for 2018 excluding special items of approximately 16.5% to 18%. This reflects approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2.5 percentage points positive impact on our normalized tax rate as a result of new U.S. tax legislation. ","As always, we look forward to improving upon this rate throughout the year as certain provisions for implementing the legislation become clarified. ","Turning now to guidance on sales and earnings. Our sales guidance for 2018 includes the impact of generics for PROCRIT and TRACLEER as well as REMICADE biosimilars which we still consider to be at risk to the ongoing patent litigation as we\u2019ve previously discussed. ","However, we do not anticipate any impact from generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA, PREZISTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. Regarding ZYTIGA, we disagree with the Patent and Trademark Office ruling last week on the IPR which contradicts their earlier decision to grant the patent. We believe the 483 patent is valid and we\u2019ll continue vigorously to defend it.","As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and it reflects the underlying performance of our business. Of course, we will also provide an estimate for our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2018 with the impact that exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","For the full year of 2018, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of between 3.5% and 4.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $79 billion to $80 billion. ","Our operational sales guidance for 2018 on an underlying basis, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, is expected to reflect growth of between 2.5% and 3.5% which is an acceleration from 2017. Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro rate last week at $1.22, our guidance for sales growth would increase by approximately 200 basis points. ","Of course, we will update this estimate as we progress throughout the year. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect an increase in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $80.5 billion to $81.5 billion. ","And now turning to earnings. Considering all the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $7.80 to $8 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting operational constant currency growth of approximately 7% to 9.5%. ","Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, with the euro at 1.22, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share.","Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from between $8 and $8.20 per share. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. ","So, in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I\u2019d like to make a few key points. We expect the operational sales growth to range between 3.5% and 4.5% and our underlying growth excluding acquisition, divestitures, at approximately 2.5% to 3.5% which is an acceleration from 2017. ","With regard to expected EPS growth on an operational adjusted basis, our guidance is strong in the range of 7% to 9.5%, consistent with our objective to grow earnings faster than sales on a constant currency basis. Also for 2018, we expect to improve our pretax operating margins by approximately 100 basis points based on the guidance I just provided, while also increasing our investment in R&D for future growth. ","While we are pleased with our performance in 2017, we also recognize that there are still areas within our business where we continue to be particularly focused on improving our performance. Additionally, we are very pleased with the passage of the new tax legislation and its positive impact on our ability to access our earnings outside the U.S. and allowing us the ability to increase our investment in innovation, a substantial portion of which we intend to deploy in the United States. ","As we execute on our growth platforms and near-term priorities that Alex shared with you this morning, we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet to deliver solid results while continuing to invest in innovation which will ensure our future growth and success.","Finally, before I turn it over to Joe for the Q&A portion, just a reminder to please save the day for our Consumer and Medical Device Business Review on May 16th. ","Thank you, and Joe, now back to you.","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Alex and Dominic. We will now move on to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. ","David Lewis ","Good morning. Just a couple questions for me. Dominic, just thinking about revenue guidance, first for 2018, can you just give us a general sense of the pieces, based on your qualitative commentary, my sense is, Consumer is relatively flattish for 2017, Devices gets a little better and the Pharmaceutical business is something around the 6% range. ","So clear acceleration. I just want to understand sort of those mixed pieces and then within pharma, the can we expect that REMICADE and ZYTIGA, can you just give us expectations around those businesses for pharma and I have a quick one for Alex.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, David. Well, as you know, we don\u2019t provide specific segment sales guidance. But I think it\u2019s fair to point out that we saw acceleration in the back half of 2018 across mostly the entire business and we expect that that will continue through 2018 and we have lots of new product launches, as you know and new product approvals in the pharma business which should help accelerate growth. ","With regards to REMICADE and ZYTIGA, again, we don\u2019t give specific guidance on individual products either, but with REMICADE as you know, we saw far less of an impact in 2017 than we had expected. The product is now been on the market for over a year and we do have an additional biosimilar market entrant. ","So we would expect that the acceleration of that biosimilar impact to REMICADE, we will see more of that in 2018 than we saw in 2017. But I can\u2019t give you a very specific number. And with respect to ZYTIGA, as I said in my opening comments about sales guidance, we do not expect to see generic competition for ZYTIGA in 2018. ","David Lewis ","Okay, very helpful. And then, just a quick strategic question for you. I know, it\u2019s a bit of a clich\u00e9 everyone expected increased M&A activity in life science post tax reforming yet and sort what we are seeing here in the last few days, how does tax reform kind of impacts your views from a corporate perspective on both the size and activity of M&A and the level of reinvestments back into the U.S. or broader reinvestments versus the money you would give back to shareholders? Thanks so much. ","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, David. Look, overall, what I would say is that, our strategy around M&A will likely stay quite consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about before and it really starts with unmet medical need. Where do we see there to be significant opportunities to improve care for patients. ","What do we see is being value creating and what do we see is being something that we can execute with a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency. Regarding tax reform, what we said from the very beginning is that one of the major reasons in addition to lowering the rate is just frankly the flexibility that it provides us and we think it actually helps make us more competitive, particularly on an international level if we happen to be in a competitive situation with other companies, because now we have greater flexibility on how we can access that cash. ","So, we think, net-net, it\u2019s a positive for us. As you heard Dominic mention earlier, regarding the more immediate tax reform impact, we think that the wise thing to do is to invest a good portion of that back into R&D. ","If you look over the past several years, the output, the productivity, particularly in our Pharmaceutical pipeline, but also in others of our investments in R&D, we think have been at the high-end and we think ultimately doing that, it will have the greatest impact on our business, will help us to get out to better serve underserved needs around the globe and that\u2019s where we are heading in that direction. ","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, David. Next question Rob?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. ","Larry Biegelsen ","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, on ZYTIGA, your assumptions for 2018 were clear, but I guess, Dominic, my question for you is, if we do see generic ZYTIGA earlier in the year or in 2018, what\u2019s your ability to offset that on the EPS line? And I have one follow-up question for Alex. ","Dominic Caruso","Well, as you know, Larry, we provide a range of guidance for both sales and earnings and obviously we\u2019ll have to see what happens with ZYTIGA in the ultimate upcoming district court case and others. But we are pretty confident that the range we provided could absorb any impact from ZYTIGA. ","Larry Biegelsen ","That\u2019s helpful. And then, Alex, 2017 seemed like a kind of a watershed year for robotics in the Medical Device space and they are starting to have some impact on your businesses in the orthopedic area and in the surgical area. So, how are you addressing this and how quickly can you launch your surgical robot in the U.S. and are you satisfied with that timeline given what we are seeing here? Thanks for taking the questions. ","Alex Gorsky","Larry, as you know, several years ago, we entered into the agreement with Google and Verb and Verily in really creating our significant approach in robotics. What I would say is that, we are excited about that opportunity. In fact, just a few weeks ago, when we were out for the - there for the conference, I got a chance to visit, see the prototype. ","I would say overall that it\u2019s on track and we are continuing to make refinements in it, but clearly, we think the area of robotics is going to have an impact on surgery and that\u2019s why we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a system that is different from those that\u2019s currently offered that we think takes it beyond simply assisting in the surgery to actually helping to improve the outcome of the surgery. ","Something that\u2019s more modular, something that\u2019s frankly is more economical and that\u2019s our goal. So overall, the project remains on track with our timelines and we are excited about it. ","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the question, Larry. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. ","Mike Weinstein ","Yes, good morning guys. I am going to try and follow-up with a couple items on the 2018 guidance. So, the top-line 2.5% to 3.5% organic would be a little below what you reported this quarter and it\u2019s one Dominic could you just spend a minute to shed a little light on the differential of how you see the 2018 top-line outlook versus what you saw this quarter and as well related to the second half of 2017? ","Second, the other income guidance of $1.7 billion to $2 billion of gains, that seems to imply an asset sale beyond what you\u2019ve already disclosed to the street recognizing that the business that you comment on, that you haven\u2019t executed on yet, is the residual diabetes business. So, is there something that you haven\u2019t yet disclosed to the street that\u2019s contemplated in that guidance? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, let me take the second question first, Mike. We \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments, we are always constantly looking at our business and making the determination whether the business is sometimes better in someone else\u2019s hands or we can get better value for our shareholders through a divestiture. So, we have considered other assets in that regard. We haven\u2019t disclosed what those assets are for obvious reasons. ","And we\u2019ll obviously continue to update our estimates as we move forward with those potential transactions. A very important point to point out though is that it\u2019s also true that whatever gains we experience we will look to obviously redeploy them back in the business which has been our history now for several years and we think that\u2019s the right way to approach these things. ","With respect to the operational guidance, excluding acquisitions and divestitures on a organic basis, we did about 2.4% for 2017 and I mentioned 2.5% to 3.5% for all of 2018. The fourth quarter of 2017 was higher than that as you pointed out and I think this just has to do with the ramp of products, particularly in the pharmaceutical business which are continuing to grow, but they are obviously continuing to grow now off of a higher base. So we took that into consideration in our estimate. ","Mike Weinstein ","Okay, and just one follow-up here Dominic, the opportunity to have with tax reforms to \u2013 there is tow pieces to it, but you have immediately access to your previously trapped $16 billion in OUS cash. Are you assuming that you are going to use a portion of that cash to immediately pay down U.S. debt? And Dominic, now that you have access to your global cash flows going forward, are you thinking any differently about ongoing buybacks or your dividend relative to how you were prior? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Well, Mike, one thing to point out is that, right, we have $16 billion of cash. Not all of it is readily repatriated back to the U.S. but not because of the U.S. tax code, but because of individual country-by-country restrictions. So, I would say that what we\u2019ve already estimated is that, roughly in the neighborhood of $12 billion of that will come back immediately. ","We\u2019ll immediately use that to fund U.S. operations. But as you have pointed out before a year reports, in the U.S. we have a shortfall of cash needs versus cash generation and that\u2019s why we were borrowing in the past. So we\u2019ll no longer need to borrow for U.S. purposes and then the balance of that we\u2019ll immediately pay down debt. ","As far as any change to our capital allocation strategy, as a result of having more readily access to the cash, as Alex pointed out, I think our strategy remains the same. We have a very disciplined approach to this. ","It starts with investing in our business which we intend to increment, as I mentioned earlier and as Alex mentioned and then obviously the dividend after that remains our top priority and we think we\u2019re already in a very healthy dividend at 50% of our cash flow being paid out to shareholders. So, we\u2019ll evaluate our opportunities on a case-by-case basis and make the best decision that we think promotes the long-term growth and benefit for our shareholders. ","Joseph Wolk","Just one point of clarification, so it\u2019s clear, we would pay down maturing debt this year, right. We looked at potentially other options, but there is a penalty associated with longer-term debt. Thanks for the question Mike. Next question please Rob?","Operator","Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO. ","Joanne Wuensch ","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Can we shift a little bit over to Medical Devices? Specifically, two questions, one big picture. You talked about 2017 being a transition year. How can we think about 2018? And then my second question really has to do with the orthopedic business. What\u2019s really going on in the spine business and in your knee franchise? Thank you. ","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Joanne, thank you very much for the questions. Why don\u2019t I take both of those? Look, I think, big picture what we see going on in our Medical Device business is, 2017 was a year of transition and what we are pleased about is the fact that we saw an increase in the number of launches. In fact, I think we ended up having 16 launches, most of them in the back-end of the year. ","We saw improved execution. Given some of the reorganizations that had occurred earlier, and frankly we think that\u2019s also what produced some of the improvement in results sequentially and if you look at fourth quarter or particularly in the hospital medical device division you saw performance of about 3.4%. Now, I think what\u2019s also important to highlight is, this is a business where we\u2019ve got businesses such as EP, which is growing at about 19%. ","We saw endo, mac growing at a very healthy rate as well around 14%. We saw areas such as energy and biosurgery growing at about 8% and of course we saw our Vision Care business growing at the core at about 6% with the contact lens, about 5% with the surgery business. So overall those businesses are actually performing quite well. ","Of course, offsetting that has been the performance of our diabetes business and some of our specialty surgery areas as Joe outlined earlier. So, overall, we remain very confident in these businesses, but clearly we\u2019ve taken a lot of action regarding innovation, taken a lot of action regarding pruning the portfolio and we\u2019ve taken some action as well to improve execution in the field. ","So we think overall it will result in an accelerated growth rate in 2018. If we dig down a little bit deeper regarding orthopedics what we would say is, the spine as we\u2019ve had a delay in some of the product launches that we had in this area. If you recall back over the last several years this was the area likely most impacted by the integration along with Synthes that resulted in the most disruption. ","We\u2019ve seen an overall slowdown in this marketplace due to reimbursement issues. So, clearly, we are focused on continuing to launch new innovation and work our way through some of the disruption that we saw earlier. We do have product launches planned for the back-end of this year including an interspace cage as well as some additional plates and screws, as well as visioning devices that we think will improve performance. ","So, again, we think there remains a lot of unmet medical need there in an area where we can clearly improve our performance. Regarding knees, we are in the midst now of launching the ATTUNE revision, which we think will be an important addition to the ATTUNE platform and we expect that will result in increased uptake in 2018. ","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the question, Joanne. Rob, next question please?","Operator","Yes, your next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. ","Q - Jeff Holford ","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So, I know there was a bit of confusions on the Q4 EBT margins that came in. I wanted maybe Dominic you can just speak to that very quickly in terms of can we expect a more normal pattern of spend in 2018 in terms of how the margins will play out in 2018? I know you\u2019ve guided to the 100 basis points pretax increase that\u2019s helpful. But you are speaking to higher R&D. ","So how can we think about COGS and SG&A on more of an adjusted basis? And then I have a quick follow-up would just be, were there any one-offs that either ZYTIGA or IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA seem to seem to have been light, obviously ZYTIGA was very impressive in the quarter. Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Yes, sure, Jeff. Well, couple things. We had announced several years ago that we were embarking on a number of cost saving efficiency initiatives which we refer to as our enterprise standards and productivity and that particular program actually culminates or reaches its peak in 2018. So we are going to see much better cost - year-over-year improvement as a result of that program in 2018 versus 2017 or 2017 versus 2016. ","You remember that our Medical Device restructuring program was also going to achieve its peak savings by 2018. So they are positive developments in the 2018 margin. We will in fact increase our investment in R&D as both Alex and I mentioned, that\u2019s a bit of a headwind on overall margin improvement, but we feel confident that at about a 100 basis point improvement which we\u2019ll see that throughout 2018. ","As far as how it meters by quarter, that all depends because we \u2013 as I mentioned earlier \u2013 to an earlier question, we tend to redeploy the investee gains from various divestitures back into the business and make incremental investments quarterly. So, that sometimes they may not be ratably distributed throughout the whole year. And Joe, do you have a comment on the ZYTIGA question?","Joseph Wolk","Sure. For ZYTIGA and IMBRUVICA, so with ZYTIGA, nothing unique in those results, Jeff. It\u2019s really being driven by the LATITUDE data where we are seeing an increase not only in the market growth but then, obviously as I mentioned earlier, almost 5 points a share for ZYTIGA in terms of comparisons to the prior year. ","With respect to IMBRUVICA, that\u2019s a good observation on your part. So we\u2019ve been growing roughly 50% to 55% in the first three quarters. This quarter it was about 38%. But that\u2019s all attributable to increased investment with us and our partner. Feeling good about the recent indications that we received and putting investment behind those. So if you normalize for that, you\u2019d be up around 51%. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Next question, Rob?","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC.","Glenn Novarro ","Hi, good afternoon or good morning guys. Alex, a question for you. There has been a major debate on whether Amazon will start distributing drugs and\/or distribute devices and supplies. Is this having any impact on how you guys are starting to think about how you distribute drugs and devices? I am just curious of your thoughts because we are getting a lot of questions from investors on these topics. Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Glenn, thank you for the question. And look, we are always considering what could be the impact of new entrants, new competitors or disruptions in any of our channels. To be clear, we are already a partner with Amazon, particularly in our Consumer segment where we sell directly through Amazon, as well as through the ecommerce channels with some of our major retailers that we work with as well as our own. ","We are watching closely in areas such as the Medical Device space and the Pharmaceutical space and we\u2019ll respond accordingly. I think, ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on their ability to meet all the regulatory requirements to make sure that customers are getting good transparency around pricing and service levels and we\u2019ll respond accordingly. ","Joseph Wolk","Great. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham ","Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. Just have a few \u2013 first one across the immunology category. IMS has pointed a pretty good growth and Derm for the aggregate J&J portfolio, but it looks GI have had a couple of tough quarters. Is this more of a mix issue and what is the path of gaining share back? ","And the second question for Alex, big picture, when you look at the Pharma segment, oncology has been consistently the fastest growing franchise, but when you think about organic R&D or external biz dev, is there a focus on shoring up underperforming therapeutic areas or do you guys look more holistically at investments in Pharma? Thanks. ","Joseph Wolk","So, Jeff, let me maybe address the first question with respect to immunology and our performance there. If you look at it, we are very pleased with the uptake for Crohn\u2019s and STELARA. You compare to the fourth quarter of last year, we are up about 11 points. Now some of that has come at the expense of REMICADE but only about five points of that. So, overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the GI space for immunology. ","Alex Gorsky","Jeff, regarding the second one, look we are always looking for opportunities across all of our therapeutic areas, the six in Pharma but also all of our other major platforms in both Medical Devices as well as Consumer. ","For example, in 2017, we completed about 16 acquisitions. I think we did almost 60 different innovation deals and about over 20 investments from JJDC and again, that represents a very diverse cross section across all of our areas. ","And clearly, when we see a gap in our portfolio that\u2019s not meeting customer needs, a good example of that is over the past several years in trauma with the extremity area or where we see new technology such as stroke that allows us to address an area where there is a lot of unmet medical need and a great new approach. So, yes, we are constantly looking across all those different platforms. ","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the questions, Jeff. Next question please, Rob?","Operator","Your next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin ","Thank you. I have a few. First, for you Dominic and Alex, now with tax reform finally approved and part of law, should we expect that your capital allocation activities or strategy will accelerate this year? You obviously have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. So, does this mean that we should expect activity from you guys to pick up? ","And along those lines, I am just curious your thoughts on some of the recent deals that have been announced, two major trades in the biotech area. It seems to be a disconnect between corporate acquirers views on value versus investors. And Alex, just want to get your sense on that. I think it was you or Dominic who said at a conference back in September that companies are going to wait for tax reform to do deals, but then, deals that was going to end up having to chase deals at much higher prices. ","So, I am just wondering what your views are on that. And then, secondly on ZYTIGA, I know you are going to defend that vigorously. But, Dominic, can you walk through the steps when would be the earliest that generics could enter the market? And then, lastly, Dominic, normally you provide a preliminary number for free cash flow in your year-end slides. I didn\u2019t see at this time. Thanks very much. ","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Hi, Jami, good morning. So, just a couple thoughts on capital allocation and recent deals and Alex will comment on that as well. So with respect to capital allocation, both Alex and I have described this approach very consistently for years and we do have a certain capital allocation priority that we go through with dividends at the top after we\u2019ve appropriately invested in our business and value-creating M&A is the second priority. ","Now, value-creating M&A depends on what value you paid for the asset and whether you are going to generate cash flows in excess of that value which includes a premium and if that deal is not value-creating for our shareholders, we are not interested in pursuing it. Even though you\u2019ve seen more activity in the early part of this year, I just want to remind you that we were extremely active last year doing in excess of $35 billion of acquisitions last year. Obviously in advance of corporate tax reform. ","With respect to ZYTIGA, one way to think about this is that, the current 30 months stay under the Hatch-Waxman Law expires in October of 2018 and the recent IPR ruling against the ZYTIGA patent does not in any way impact that 30 month stay, meaning that the 30 month stay is not lifted. It\u2019s still in existence. ","Of course, during that time period, we will go into district court and have hearings on the patent and should we succeed with those hearings then, of course the 30 month stay wouldn\u2019t have any difference, because the patent extends beyond this year or into 2027. ","Also with respect to free cash flow, Jami, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Alex for any other comments on recent deals, we don\u2019t typically provide a free cash flow estimate in our guidance. ","Although I can tell you that we had very strong free cash flow in 2017 at $17.8 billion, and typically our free cash flow growth approximates our earnings growth because our businesses do a great job of managing their receivables, payables and capital deployment. So, a good rule of thumb is, free cash flow generally grows at the same rate as our earnings growth. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Jami. Thank you very much for the question. Look, I would pick up where Dominic left off which you look over the past year, we did make over $35 billion worth of investment ahead of this which we felt was the right thing to do. We do that really based upon unmet medical need, either franchise or as a technology complementary to something that we have \u2013 that we are already doing or is it an area where we feel that, our R&D clinical regulatory development skills or commercial reimbursement skills frankly can make a difference and ultimately is this value creating. ","We said quite consistently over the past few years and I think we\u2019ve acted in a way that we would prefer earlier stage investments and we think across all of our different categories, we demonstrated that whether it\u2019s the next ZYTIGA or IMBRUVICA or the next NEUTROGENA or the next Biosense Webster when we can get a great new technology or innovation or science that we can then ramp up through clinical development or regulatory skills and then launch and create billion dollar platforms and major breakthroughs for patients, that\u2019s our preferred model. ","And look, we \u2013 at the same time, we do watch competitiveness and what\u2019s going on in different categories which we\u2019ll continue to do this year. But we feel confident in the strength of our pipeline as we talked about. Again, whether it\u2019s in Pharma, with the very high number of line extensions or products we expect to launch over the next several years or our Medical Device space or in Consumer. ","We think we\u2019ve got a nice balanced approach between internal and external R&D at about 50% each of them gets in. Ultimately, we\u2019ve also got the flexibility to move depending on what opportunities present themselves, because frankly of the way that we\u2019ve been able to manage our balance sheet, because of our overall strong position, should an opportunity present itself, we can \u2013 we always have the purgative to engage at that point in time. So, thanks a lot and I expect that\u2019s the way we will navigate our way through 2018 and beyond. ","Joseph Wolk","Next question please, Rob?","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bob Hopkins ","Hi, thanks and good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for me. One on Consumer and one on Devices. I\u2019ll just lay them out there to make it easy. So, first on Consumer, just a pretty straightforward question, some of the issues impacting that business in 2017 were market-related. ","So I guess my question is, will those market issues be cleared up in 2018 and could be the combination of better market growth and changes in Baby Care and other initiatives already get back to historical growth rates for Consumer in 2018. ","That\u2019s my Consumer question. The Device question I wanted to ask is that, 2017 is a year where there is a bunch of strategic moves made both in terms of divestitures and M&A and Alex you were starting 2018 you are once again emphasizing portfolio management in Devices as a core strategy. ","And I am just curious, is that emphasis on portfolio management, are you referencing there the decision you\u2019ll make this year on diabetes or is there the potential for other kind of portfolio management moves in Devices in 2018? Thank you very much. ","Alex Gorsky","Yes, thank you, Bob. Let me start. I would say, yes, we do expect our Consumer business to grow at a faster rate in 2018 than we saw in 2017 and you are correct in that we think some of the market forces, i.e. the shift to ecommerce, shift in some cases to more natural brands, digital types of brands have been more secular in nature and affected all of the large FMCG companies. ","That being said, we are not just sitting back. We are making aggressive moves in areas such as ecommerce investments in that shift. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we are taking the innovation model of a company like Vogue which has continued to do very well as part of Johnson & Johnson and we are trying to export that to other areas in our Consumer innovation to be faster, more agile, even more flexible. ","And so, we think that combination combined within some cases just improved execution, particularly in areas like our Baby line that\u2019s going to be going through a major relaunch through the course of 2018 is going to result in improved performance. And by the way, we still have some core areas such as NEUTROGENA, AVEENO, LISTERINE, OTC that we remain very confident in. These are great brands with great science behind them that have also got great consumer loyalty as well as attention. ","Now if I switch now to Devices, I believe we\u2019ve been pretty consistent saying that portfolio management can and should be and has been an integral part of our strategy and so for 2018, yes, part of that, we\u2019ve mentioned that we are actively looking at strategic options for diabetes. ","But there are also other areas where they have not met our criterion in terms of us feeling as though we\u2019ve got the right competitive position, the right technology going forward or it\u2019s not complementary to one of our existing platforms that it\u2019s not that it\u2019s a bad business or a bad technology, but perhaps it\u2019s better in such a way that in someone else\u2019s hands that we would continue that in 2018 as well. ","Dominic Caruso","And Bob, one thing to hopefully not to read into too much, because we have the question in light of the perspective of Devices. When we did this portfolio management, it\u2019s across all three of our major businesses and so, we have plans in 2018 for all three of the businesses where assets are being evaluated and we may make decisions with respect to those assets. So it\u2019s not limited to Devices. ","Joseph Wolk","Thanks for the questions, Bob. Next question please, Rob?","Operator","Next question is from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. ","Vamil Divan ","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, one just on REMICADE in the U.S. I think you mentioned most of the impacts just on the price side as opposed to volume. But could you just give us a sense exactly how much of the sort of overall market volume is still with the brand and how much is going to either the biosimilars? ","And second, maybe just a pipeline one that haven't really talked much about on Esketamine. I think that\u2019s an important data point for you guys. So can you just give us a sense of when we should expect that data? And then, obviously there is some unusual features that product in terms of the administration of safety it maybe a scheduled product. What do you think, just maybe frame your expectations on what would be sort of considered good data as we await the results?","Joseph Wolk","Okay, so, Vamil, with respect to REMICADE in the U.S. specifically, I would say that the volume is still up around the high 90%. So, all of the change that you saw in the quarter of about 9% down was associated with price declines. With respect to data for Esketamine, so there is a couple of different presentations. ","There is, as you know, four five trials with respect to that program. I would say, the first long-term safety data to be released is likely going to be the 3002 study. That\u2019s also considered important for short-term efficacy as well as the safety. We would expect that possibly at several events in the second quarter of this year. Thanks for the question. Next question please, Rob and I think this is probably going to be our last one.","Operator","Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. ","Danielle Antalffy ","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me and I appreciate it. Just a quick question following up on ZYTIGA, Dominic totally understand you aren\u2019t assuming any generic competition, appreciate your answer that you think that you can offset that, but I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there, where you think you are being \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say overly conservative, but more conservative where you could see upside to potentially offset some of \u2013 some headwinds that maybe aren\u2019t being considered in the guidance? ","Dominic Caruso","Yes, thanks, Danielle. Well, what I said to the answer the question earlier was that, obviously we have to wait and see what happens with the district court decision which happens later this quarter. But in the end, should ZYTIGA generics come to market, which of course, we are not expecting we intend to defend the patent vigorously. I said that our range of sales and earnings guidance should be sufficiently wide to absorb that impact. I think we are going to look at upside in all of our businesses going forward. But I think the range we\u2019ve provided should be sufficient to offset any impact of a negative ZYTIGA decision. ","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Danielle, and thanks to everyone for the questions posed today and your continued interest in our company. Apologies to those who we couldn\u2019t get to due to time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as needed. ","I will now turn the call back to Alex for some closing remarks.","Alex Gorsky","Okay, thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We are proud to share our results for 2017, our strong results and we\u2019ve been more excited about the lining up with you and discussing the prospects for 2018 which we are very excited about as well. So, thanks for your continued belief and support and commitment to Johnson & Johnson.","We look forward to updating you as we move our way through the year, in particular at the May meeting we will be reviewing our Medical Device and Consumer businesses. And, again, thank you very much and we\u2019ll look forward to continued updates over the course of the year. ","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning and welcome. I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2015.","Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Sandi Peterson, Group Worldwide Chairman, and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I will begin by briefly reviewing second quarter for the corporation and for our three business segments. Alex will provide additional commentary on the business and our progress with regards to our near-term priorities. Next, Sandi will provide an update on our consumer and consumer medical device businesses. Lastly, Dominic will review the income statement and discuss guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company\u2019s subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.","Now, I would like to review results for the second quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the second quarter of 2015, down 8.8% versus second quarter 2014. On an operational basis, sales were down 0.9% and currency had a negative impact of 7.9%. In the U.S., sales were down 2.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.5%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 14.8%.","On an operational basis, the Asia Pacific Africa region grew by 2.2%, while Europe grew 1% and the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined 4%. Growth in the U.S. and Japan was negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. Growth in all regions was impacted by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 1.7% worldwide, 0.6% in the U.S., and 2.7% outside the U.S. Additionally, excluding hepatitis C sales underlying operational growth was 5%.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.5 billion and earnings per share were $1.61 versus $1.51 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $230 million and a charge of $66 million for after-tax special items. 2014 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $807 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.71, representing decreases of 6.3% and 3.9% respectively as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6.7%.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. I will begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide consumer segment sales of $3.5 billion increased 2.3%, with U.S. sales up 2.7%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 2.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 3.1% worldwide, 2.9% in the U.S., and 3.2% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, Women\u2019s Health outside the U.S. and Oral Care.","OTC sales growth was driven by worldwide analgesics, ZYRTEC in the U.S. and other upper respiratory products outside the U.S. Upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC sales, included a seasonal inventory build. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 44%, up from 39% a year ago. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health products outside the U.S.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.9 billion increased 1% with U.S. sales down 1.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.8%. New competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 9.7%, 16.5% and 2.5% respectively. U.S. results included a positive adjustment to sales reserves for managed Medicaid rebates reflecting final data received. U.S. comparisons to second quarter 2014 were positively impacted by approximately 2% and worldwide by approximately 1%. The most significant impact from the managed Medicaid adjustment was through hormonal contraceptives. Significant contributors to growth were INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION, CONCERTA and immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI.","Strong momentum in market share increases drove results for INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET. In the U.S., INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET achieved 5.9% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 13.2% for the quarter and 5.2% in primary care, up 1.2% and 0.8% respectively on a sequential basis. INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET remains the category leader in new to brand share with endocrinologists and has greater than 80% preferred access across commercial and Part D plans.","Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in the second line CLL and MCL. Outside the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake, particularly in Germany, France, and the UK.","XARELTO sales were up nearly 31% and total prescription share, or TRx, for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to 15.4%, up over 2 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care reached 12.4% and in cardiology, 23.7%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay. Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market, at nearly 12.5%, drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was approximately 28.6% of that market, down approximately 1.7 points on a sequential basis due to increased competition.","As an update, during the quarter, we received several Paragraph IV notifications from generic manufacturers advising that they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA in the U.S. before the expiration of the relevant patents listed in the orange book. The composition of matter patent is owned by our partner, BTG, and expires in December 2016 and the method of treatment patent is owned by Janssen Oncology Inc. and expires in August 2027. We are currently evaluating the notices.","Outside the U.S., ZYTIGA achieved very strong growth in Asia and Latin America, which was partly offset by lower sales in Europe due to increased competition. INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results due primarily to increased market share while CONCERTA growth was primarily due to therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors. The results for immunology were driven by strong double digit market growth complemented by increased market share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. Growth was partially offset by lower REMICADE sales to our distributors reflecting the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe as well as the reduction in inventory levels.","I will now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion decreased 4.7%. U.S. sales declined 5.8% while sales outside the U.S. declined 3.9%. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 1.4% worldwide with the U.S. up 1.6% and growth of 1.4% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by Specialty Surgery, Cardiovascular Care and Orthopaedics. Specialty Surgery growth was driven by bio-surgery growth of over 8% and energy growth of approximately 6% due to market growth, share gains in certain segments and new product introductions.","Cardiovascular growth was driven by 10% worldwide increase in electrophysiology due to strong sales of ThermoCool SmartTouch Catheter. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by knees and hips as well as ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in sports medicine. The growth was partially offset by lower sales in trauma and spine due to pricing pressure coupled with the timing of tender business and competitive challenges in spine. Knees worldwide increased 4% with the U.S. up 5% and sales outside the U.S. up 2%, driven by strong sales of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure. Hips growth of 2% worldwide was driven by 4% growth in the U.S. with strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Outside the U.S., sales were flat with strong growth in China and India, offset by lower sales in the Middle East due to the timing of tender business. For your reference, there were some notable developments in the second quarter, which we have summarized on this slide to assist you as you develop your models.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s second quarter of 2015. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Louise and good morning everyone. I really appreciate you taking the time to join our call today. And since we are at the midpoint of the year, I am excited to share the progress we have made against our near-term priorities. I will also use the time today to give some perspective on the environment that we are operating in and some of the macro level issues we are seeing and also discuss why we believe with our innovation model and breadth and scale of our business, the Johnson & Johnson is strongly positioned to drive continued growth and shareholder value. So I will start the discussion though where I always do with Our Credo.","Our Credo serves as the moral compass for our company and expresses a set of values that bond our associates worldwide with a shared commitment to meet and really exceed the expectations of the more than 1 billion people a day that rely on our products as well as to support our fellow colleagues, the communities in which we live and work and generate solid return to our shareholders. Now back in January, I laid out our near-term priorities for the business and I am pleased with our progress towards them. Across the enterprise, we are very focused on delivering our financial and quality commitments.","First, our commitment to ensuring our products meet the highest quality standards is of course non-negotiable. And as to our financial commitments thus far in the year, we generated sales of $35.2 billion, reflecting the strong underlying operational growth across the enterprise of about 6% when we adjust for the impact of Hepatitis C sales and acquisitions and divestitures. And for the first six months, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.27. On an operational basis, we delivered adjusted EPS of $3.59 growing at 5.3%. As we have highlighted previously, we knew there are year-over-year comparisons to our current results would be challenging because of the tremendous contributions of OLYSIO last year as well as the impact of divestitures we made and also the significant devaluation of major foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.","Now despite these headwinds our broad base of innovative offerings, scale and global footprint are driving our strong core performance. In pharmaceuticals, we reported sales of $15.7 billion, reflecting strong underlying operational growth when excluding the impact of Hepatitis C and divestitures of over 11% for the first half of 2015, led by our new and core products including INVOKANA, IMBRUVICA, XARELTO and STELARA and ZYTIGA. Our focused R&D strategy and commitment to driving launch excellence to ensure broad access and reimbursement has really come together to make a difference for patients and have this well-positioned to continue to drive above industry compound annual growth rate over the next several years. Fueled by seven of our recently launched products that we expect will each exceed $1 billion in sales this year and the more than 10 new products we plan to file by 2019 that each have $1 billion plus potential of their own based on their transformational potential to treat significant unmet medical needs worldwide.","And just last week, our partner Genmab announced that we have completed the FDA submission for daratumumab, a promising new breakthrough treatment option for people with multiple myeloma. This organization has collectively done great work to generate strong clinical evidence in the development process, which is enabling our reimbursement teams to gain the right coverage levels in order to create broad access and drive the strong performance of our products despite the pricing pressure that exist in the marketplace.","Now I also want to make a comment here on our position regarding biosimilar competition for REMICADE, which I know many of you are thinking about. Remember, biosimilars are not generics and we expect the biosimilar market to behave quite differently than the market typically has toward the introduction of a generic. Also more than 2.2 million people have been treated with REMICADE and about 70% of the current patients are receiving sustained and effective treatment so we believe their doctors are very unlikely to switch them off with that level of success. And we also have a patent for the REMICADE antibody that doesn\u2019t expire until September 2018 that you can be sure we will continue to vigorously defend.","Look, we know competition in the immunology space is fierce and to ensure we maintain the leadership position, we built an established portfolio of $1 billion plus medicines that include STELARA and SIMPONI and have potential $1 billion plus products in our late stage development like sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis and guselkumab for psoriasis that we expect to introduce in the near-term. And we are also making very significant investments in disruptive research areas like the microbiome, which holds the potential to intercept the disease and prevent it entirely that will have applications in immunology and really across all our disease areas.","Now turning to Medical Devices, you know we are number one or number two in the majority of the categories in which we compete and have ten $1 billion plus platforms. Year-to-date, we reported global medical device sales of $12.6 billion, which is an operational decline of 4.6% due to the impact of the sale of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, which we completed a year ago. When we adjust for that, our underlying operational growth in medical devices is up 1.4%. I have been particularly pleased with the performance in several areas of this business where new innovations are driving growth, including our Biosense Webster business, which has grown nearly 11% operationally for the first six months of the year. Our Endocutter business has grown 15.5% and our Biosurgery business with continued strong growth of 7.5%.","In diabetes, our products and strong in-market execution are helping to revitalize that business while our Vision Care business is on track to return to growth later in the year when we will anniversary the impact of the 2014 price reset. In Orthopaedics, the business grew 1.5% operationally this year with good growth in the reconstruction and sports medicine segment. Particularly in the second quarter here in the U.S. where despite the pricing dynamics in the market, we saw over 5% growth in knees and approximately 4% in hips. Our spine and trauma businesses however, have lagged market growth today and we are absolutely committed to turning them around. And we have new products launching this year that will help us do just that.","Now as we look at this market, the ongoing consolidation among health systems and within the insurance industry is continuing to create pressure on pricing. We have been encouraged though by data showing that healthcare utilization trends in the U.S. have continued to improve for the fourth consecutive quarter with growth in both hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures. And we remain optimistic about increased global healthcare utilization as well. So, we are absolutely committed to accelerating our growth in medical devices through innovation and through our research and development, which has been productive as the teams have already submitted more than half of the 30 major filings we previously announced we plan to file by the end of 2016. And the work we are doing with Google illustrates how we are aiming to pioneer the operating room of the future with robotic surgery tools that will increase the surgeon\u2019s precision and minimize trauma for their patients, while also reducing cost for the systems.","We are also transforming our go-to-market models to fully leverage the breadth and scale of our capabilities, but we have taken significant measures to strengthen our core businesses and effectively position ourselves to lead over the long-term. We just recently integrated our Global Orthopaedics and Global Surgery businesses under the leadership of Gary Pruden, which will enable us to have a much more holistic approach to the way we do business. And the goal here is very straightforward. Let\u2019s enhance our partnerships with the hospital systems and identify ways to improve outcomes by leveraging our comprehensive portfolio. We already have numerous examples of co-promotions, broad contracting agreements and service and solution offerings in place that we can look to expand and by better working in this new alignment model, we will be better positioned to great more of them to drive future growth. Gary will be on the third quarter call in October to tell you more about this approach.","And now in the Consumer business, Sandi Peterson and her team, which includes our new Worldwide Chairman for the consumer companies, Jorge Mesquita, a seasoned leader who has been with us since the end of last year, are doing tremendous work in building and executing a strategy that has effectively addressed the past challenges in our supply chain and reprioritized our approach in the category. And we are positioned to expand our market leadership in key segments moving forward. Year-to-date, we generated $6.9 billion in sales and reported operational growth of nearly 4%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, driven by our market leading OTC and Oral Care businesses. And our strategy to focus the portfolio around the key consumer need states in brands that are backed with strong clinical science and professional endorsements is having a strong impact. The United States OTC medicines are sharply up 13% for the year led by the strong campaigns who are leading in support and the re-launch of key brands like TYLENOL, MOTRIN and ZYRTEC. And our momentum here could not have been achieved without the efforts of our colleagues to complete the complex work required around the consent decree.","Globally, we see strong operational growth in emerging markets, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, India, Russia and Venezuela. We are however experiencing market pressures in China, where our volumes have slowed due to lower demand that is being compounded by shifts in consumer behaviors and the emergence of new retail channels in the country. In a few minutes, Sandi will take you through the strategy and approach for how our consumer-facing businesses are leveraging our unique consumer insights and integrating science and different forms of technology to better meet the needs of consumers and drive growth.","But before we do that, I want to reiterate how we are navigating the environmental changes before us and how we strongly positioned Johnson & Johnson to deliver continued growth. As you well know, everything starts with innovation. And at Johnson & Johnson, we are doing that on multiple fronts and we are committed to working with researchers around the world to ensure we continue to operate the leading edge of science, medicine and technology. And that approach drives our enterprise R&D and the significant investments we are making to benefit patients and stakeholders.","We have a good balance of internal and externally sourced innovations and acquisitions have accounted for just under half of our sales growth over the last decade and we are always actively looking for new value-creating acquisitions and deals to continue that success. We also invested about 11.5% of our net trade sales or $8.5 billion in R&D last year across the enterprise to discover in-license and develop innovative new products, and you can see the impact reflected in our portfolio and robust development pipeline, which includes 25 active late-stage development programs, 160-plus early-stage programs in over 70 venture investments. And in just two years, there is already 90 start-ups working in our J-Labs, which creates tremendous access to new ideas and potential downstream partnerships for the future.","Now, when it comes to making significant R&D investments, we must also focus on managing through the inherent complexities in the global regulatory environment in order to ensure our products are ultimately able to reach consumers. We are encouraged by the steps governments are taking to increase access to quality healthcare for their people and to also create and support a more innovation-friendly environment through designations and speed to review and approval of transformational products. We benefited from that with IMBRUVICA, and today, we have two other candidates in our pharma pipeline already designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA. At the same time, we can all agree that governments around the world must do more to protect intellectual property and ensure fair, transparent and consistent enforcement of regulations governing the trade of innovative products and we will continue to watch and engage in these issues into more than 65 countries in which we do business.","Globally, about half our total year-to-date sales come from countries outside the United States with strong national and regional models like those we have installed in China and Southeast Asia, we are better able to maximize the breadth of our portfolio, interact more effectively with governments and develop contracting strategies and gain consumer insights that are shaping our international portfolios and informing R&D and ultimately driving growth. And by executing with excellence in all that we do, we have introduced a strong cadence of new product launches over the past five years that today account for about 25% of our overall sales and we are taking steps to ensure we are even more effective and efficient across the enterprise by investing in greater uses of technology and streamlining our back office processes, which we expect will help to free up about $1 billion that we can invest back into the business by 2018.","We are also continuing to make strategic decisions about the areas we are going to participate in or move on from. As we stated before, our focus is on areas where we are or we can be number one or number two in a particular area as well as on those products or businesses that will be directly complementary. And if we have an asset or a business that doesn\u2019t meet those criteria, we have demonstrated that we will divest it and redirect our resources to accelerate existing programs or to acquire new ones that we think are ultimately going to help more patients and also add more value to our enterprise. We also see that our broad base across the healthcare spectrum is a competitive advantage when the strategies we create consider and where appropriate incorporate insights and innovations from every aspect of our operations to attack disease and improve health outcomes.","The work we are doing with IBM and Apple does this by cutting across the enterprise and leveraging our science, technology and consumer insights to empower patients and caregivers to help speed the post-surgical recovery process. Executing our strategy ultimately comes down to people and by focusing on them and emphasizing our Credo-based purpose, we developed a deep bench of extraordinary talent, we are accountable for driving their businesses and we will also ensure we are taking leading roles within the industry and world medical community to combat global public health issues like Ebola and HIV.","Now, just to summarize, Johnson & Johnson is a company that\u2019s built a remarkable legacy and has a very exciting future. Healthcare though remains one of every society\u2019s greatest challenges and nothing affects people more personally or affects communities and nations more directly. Our business is strong and you can see that we are continuing to make considerable investments in innovation and have a robust pipeline of truly transformative products to ultimately benefit patients and that we are taking actions to strengthen our leadership positions in areas in which we compete. With our transparent and consistent capital allocation strategy, we extended our track record of dividend increases to 53 consecutive years in April when we declared a 7.1% increase, taking our quarterly payout up to $0.75 per share and have returned about 70% of our free cash flow over the past decade to investors outpacing the S&P 500 in 2014 as well as over the last 3, 10 and 20 years.","With that, it\u2019s now my distinct pleasure to turn the call over to Sandi Peterson. Sandi joined Johnson & Johnson just over 2.5 years ago and is leading a significant transformation across major components of our enterprise, including our consumer-facing businesses, enterprise supply chain, quality and IT and she has been a tremendous leader here since day 1. I want to thank her and her team for what they have already accomplished for our business and more importantly for what they will continue to do to help patients and consumers worldwide.","With that, I am pleased to turn the meeting now over to Sandi and we will rejoin you a bit later to take your questions.","Sandi Peterson","Good morning. I am happy to have the opportunity to talk about our progress in our consumer-facing businesses, consumer diabetes solutions and vision care. I will also discuss the evolution in our approach to technology across the enterprise. Increasingly, as we lead through the disruptions and opportunities in global healthcare, we are fusing the power of technology with the power of science to deliver improved outcomes for patients, consumers and customers.","First, our three consumer-facing businesses, as Alex said earlier, the future of these businesses looks promising. While they are at different stages of transformation, we believe that they are all well-positioned in attractive, growing global markets, and we are driving scale and growth in each. Let me start with consumer. Our iconic consumer brands are J&J\u2019s face to the world. They are how we are known by millions around the globe. They are a first point of entry into emerging markets, so they really are very important to the overall enterprise. They are and will increasingly be important contributors to J&J\u2019s financial performance. Demographic trends and changes in the way consumers make healthcare decisions are creating new opportunities for our consumer business. Our consumer expertise and insight are highly valuable to payers and providers, which differentiates us from our competitors. We view a healthy consumer business as a growth annuity for J&J with less volatility than other markets.","As many of you know, we launched our new consumer strategy in 2013. We focused on stabilizing and revitalizing the business, re-mediating quality issues in U.S. OTC and being clear about where and how to compete and win around the world. We are executing successfully against that strategy. We are pleased to say that we have re-mediated and re-launched our U.S. OTC business. Over 80% of our brands have returned to the market. TYLENOL Arthritis will launch soon. We have made significant progress in meeting consent decree requirements. The FDA has certified our manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Lancaster, Pennsylvania.","We recently had a successful FDA inspection in Fort Washington and are awaiting final notification. Our OTC brands continue to be loved by consumers and we have regained the trust of our customers. Most of our OTC products are endorsed as number one in their categories by healthcare professionals. TYLENOL remains the number one doctor recommended brand for pain relief and the brand most used by hospitals. ZYRTEC, Children\u2019s TYLENOL and Children\u2019s MOTRIN are also number one recommended brands. Last year, our OTC portfolio grew four times the category in the U.S. That strength has continued this year with 13% growth in the first half and 16% in the latest quarter.","More broadly, across the consumer business, we have made significant progress in creating a world class brand building and marketing organization. We have globalized the management of 12 mega brands and are focused on 11 consumer need states. We have expanded these brands into new markets and are seeing strong share gains in Oral Care, Beauty and OTC. We are growing 11% year-to-date and gaining share in feminine protection, for example, in places like India, Germany, South Africa and Poland. And we have revitalized our iconic BAND-AID Brand. In the U.S., Band-Aid consumption grew 6.3% and we gained 2 share points. Thanks to decorated BAND-AID and commercial innovation.","As we invest in our global brands and our top regional brands and in our priority markets, we are building new marketing capabilities such as digital. We doubled our digital media investments and digital channels with emphasis on social and mobile. Today, 40% of our digital ad spending is via mobile and more than 90% of our Facebook ads are served up on either smartphones or tablets. This global centralized marketing approach is bringing our beloved brands to their full potential. You may have seen the results of the new model, Come to Life in the Johnson\u2019s Baby So Much More campaign, the first global campaign for our iconic baby equity. The campaign launched in 7 lead markets in February and is rolled out to more than 20 markets. By the third quarter of this year, all major markets will launch. Early results show sequential consumption growth and share improvement. In the U.S. alone, through May, Johnson\u2019s has grown 2.4 share points since the launch.","Our product pipeline in consumer is also quite robust. We are focused on developing science-based, clinically validated products grounded in deep consumer insights and most importantly endorsed by professionals. We have 20 key product launches this year, for example, NEUTROGENA Hydro Boost, MOTRIN Liquid Gels and the launch of the new LISTERINE whitening formula in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Improving our supply chain has also been another critical focus in the consumer business with a strong emphasis on the U.S. OTC consent decree. Across the enterprise, we have made remarkable progress in transforming our supply chain to ensure we deliver quality, customer reliability and benchmark profitability.","We continue to see the benefits of reintegrating our supply chain organization to drive performance improvements in every J&J segment. As we look ahead in consumer, we will continue to rebuild our competitive edge. The underlying environmental drivers, demographics, the developing middle-class in emerging markets and lifestyle shifts suggest growing consumer need for our products and increased opportunity to help more people live healthier, more vibrant lives.","Across the business, we are focused on delivering above-market growth and benchmark profitability. Consumer IBT margin before special items and intangible amortization expense has increased from 14.1% in 2013 to 15.4% in 2014 and we will continue to improve profitability until we achieve benchmark levels. Our organic sales, adjusted for currency and excluding acquisitions and divestitures, grew approximately 4% in the first half. Since mid 2013, we have grown organic sales steadily. Last year, we grew share for the first time in a number of years and we are committed to continuing that trend. We manage our consumer brand portfolio actively with an eye towards targeted expansion in key geographies and need states through focused acquisitions and licensing agreements. A recent example includes the acquisition in India of ORSL. The intersection of changes in the healthcare landscape, disruptions in the retail environment and changes in consumer expectations and behaviors creates an opportunity J&J\u2019s consumer business is well-suited to capitalize on.","Now, let me turn to our Diabetes Solutions business. Diabetes is the fourth largest healthcare category in the world. Globally, the therapies and devices market is growing at 5%. 50% of patients with diabetes are, unfortunately, undiagnosed or not controlled, which creates an opportunity for us to grow and an important opportunity to impact patient\u2019s lives. Given the power of our OneTouch brand, a highly innovative pipeline, strong commercial execution and operational efficiency, we are well-positioned to deliver profitable growth in diabetes despite negative industry pricing dynamics.","In blood glucose monitoring, we hold the number one value and volume position in our 9 top markets. This year\u2019s OneTouch Verio platform launch is our most successful launch in the last two decades. In the U.S. alone, volume share grew 3 points. We have strong penetration in emerging markets, where type 2 diabetes is growing and we have simplified our portfolio dramatically, reducing the number of strip platforms from 5 to 2 and module mere offerings from 14 to 3. We have reduced our facility footprint, slashed the number of SKUs by more than 55% and taken significant cost out of the business.","In insulin delivery, we are growing at market-leading rates, up operationally 32% year-to-date worldwide, driven by Animas Vibe. In 2015, we took over the number two share position. In addition, we are making excellent progress in preparing for the launch of Calibra, a new product which will create an entirely new category. Calibra is a wearable, disposable insulin delivery patch that meets type 2 patients\u2019 needs for discretion, convenience and control. We are beginning the clinical outcome study and anticipate entering the market next year.","Looking forward, we are developing insight-driven, market-appropriate innovations across the BGM and insulin delivery platforms in areas such as digital solutions, continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery. We will continue to leverage enterprise capabilities and expand targeted strategic partnerships. Great examples of this include our collaboration with Nova Biomedical and Hospital Systems and Dexcom with continuous glucose monitoring pumps. We are particularly enthusiastic about the potential to improve engagement and health outcomes with digital solutions that motivate patients to better self manage while creating value for healthcare providers and healthcare systems.","Now, let me turn to Vision Care. Eye health remains one of the largest, fastest growing and most underserved segments in healthcare. Vision correction represents more than half of that market with contact lenses representing a $7 billion segment, the presbyopia and astigmatism markets are especially underserved. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Vision Care has a long history as the global market leader in contact lenses. Our success was built on category leading innovation, strong relationships with the eye care professional and the most recognized brand equity in the category. It\u2019s no secret, however that we faced capacity and portfolio issues in Vision Care in 2012 and 2013. At the same time, competition intensified and consumer preferences shifted. The market structure has evolved in response, driving increased emphasis on e-commerce and increased price competition between channels. These developments have reduced engagement for eye care professionals, who are an important ingredient in strong category health.","Despite this, we continued to lead the category globally by 11 points. We continue to grow at double-digits in our lead emerging markets. BRIC market operational sales are up double digits, driven by continued strong performance of Russia, Brazil and China. Last year, we instituted a one-time price reset to bring more value to consumers in close partnership with eye care professionals in the trade in the U.S. and Japan. We will anniversary this event in Q3, as Alex said earlier and should see revenue momentum in the second half. Share has stabilized in the U.S. for five consecutive months. We are outperforming the market in volume in our top two strategic brands, ACUVUE OASYS and 1-Day ACUVUE MOIST and our equity measures with eye care professionals have improved. In Q2 alone, we grew 15% operationally in Japan, driven by strong performance of our leading 1-DAY ACUVUE TruEye and the recent launch of 1-Day ACUVUE DEFINE as well as favorable comps.","Our R&D strategy leverages consumer expertise and science based, clinically supported manufacturing enabled innovation and we have built a robust multi-generational pipeline. We are launching our first major innovations in 5 years, with 1-Day ACUVUE DEFINE, 1-Day ACUVUE Multifocal and ACUVUE OASYS overnight. You will see us accelerate innovation in high growth specialty segments such as beauty, presbyopia and astigmatism. We will sustain innovation in our largest core platforms spherical reusable and sphere daily disposable. We anticipate at least one major product launch in each of the next 3 years, including innovations with the potential to disrupt the category. Vision Care used the new marketing process developed in consumer to re-launch the iconic ACUVUE brand. The new global ACUVUE campaign which went live last week is designed to drive consumer engagement and category growth and ensure the differentiated position with eye care professionals.","Our world class supply chain is a competitive advantage in Vision Care. Our manufacturing team produced approximately 4 billion lenses in 2014. We are continuing to invest in capacity expansion while operating with 99.6% customer service levels. Though we are still in the throes of rejuvenating our eye care business, we have made considerable progress, which will continue this year and into the next. As we bring our core contact lens business back to market leading growth, we will also pursue our aspirations in the broader eye health market.","Alex started this morning by talking about the power of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s broad base in healthcare. Our consumer facing businesses are a critical contributor to that broad base. While Consumer, Diabetes Solutions and Vision Care are different stages in their transformations and represent unique opportunities, we are driving scale and growth in all of them. Before I turn it over to Dominic, I would like to share some perspective on how Johnson & Johnson is capitalizing on the way technology is reshaping the entire healthcare landscape.","The consumerization of healthcare, wearables and mobile apps are giving patients unprecedented access to health information. Physicians, regulators and payers are leveraging big data, analytics and real world evidence to personalized care, understand product safety and efficacy and drive improved outcome. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced centers are creating new opportunities to take advantage of the best clinical and wellness expertise. We are at the tipping point, where technology is becoming the medium through which healthcare can become a more effective and efficient system. The opportunities this creates for Johnson & Johnson to become a healthcare technology innovator are immense.","We have identified key technology areas that will accelerate growth and are actively pursuing programs and partnerships in those areas. The relationships with Google and with IBM and Apple that Alex mentioned are great examples. There are others in the works and more to come. We are working with and talking to nearly every major technology company and many early stage companies. We are collaborating with retailers like Walgreens and CVS, where care is increasingly delivered, health plans like Aetna and Kaiser Permanente and health systems such as Jefferson Health and Premier to leverage technology digital tools and our health and wellness expertise. We find that Johnson & Johnson is most often the partner of choice for technology providers. We have the patient and consumer insights, the clinical and behavior modification expertise and the regulatory experience that can combine with technology to transform the continuum of care. This is particularly exciting when you think about the work that we are doing with payers and providers as in our work with IBM and Apple. We are creating an ecosystem embedded in hospital networks, which gives us the ability to integrate the right patient data with the right record and the right clinical outcome in the healthcare IT infrastructure.","I have been in healthcare long enough to have heard over and over again that technology was going to disrupt the industry beyond recognition. But today, maturing technology, scientific advances and global healthcare reform are combining to make disruption a reality. Today, technology is intrinsic to the business. As the world\u2019s most broadly based healthcare company, we are uniquely positioned to be the company that connects the fragmented world of healthcare. Now let me summarize. Our consumer facing businesses are executing well against focused strategies. They are demonstrating results, improving profitability and growing. They have strong presence in the world\u2019s fastest growing markets and are building insight-led innovation pipelines.","Each business is strengthening its brand building capabilities, actively managing its portfolio and leveraging technologies in ways that increase efficiency and create competitive advantage. Across J&J, we are using technology to unlock the power of the enterprise, to improve patient and financial outcomes in ways that will create value for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. And we are building what I firmly believe is the best team of leaders in the industry.","With that, I will turn it over to Dominic and I look forward to answering your questions.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks Sandi and good morning everyone. As you have heard on the call, we are certainly pleased with the progress we continue to make in the execution against our priorities, which is reflected in the solid underlying financial results we have achieved thus far in 2015. And as Alex and Sandi discussed, we are well-positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare environment. I will take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the second quarter and we will also then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of the year.","Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2015. As we expected and as many of you on the sell side also reflected in your updated models, direct comparisons to our second quarter of 2014 are challenging due to the exceptional uptake of OLYSIO that we recorded last year as well as currency headwinds and the impact of not having Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics in our results for 2015.","Our sales results for the second quarter 2015 were essentially in line with analyst estimates as reflected in First Call. On an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and excluding the impact of hep C products, sales were up 5% for the quarter. Please now direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible amortization expense.","Adjusted net earnings of $4.8 billion in the quarter are down 6% compared to Q2 2014 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 versus $1.78 a year ago are down approximately 4%. However, the adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. And excluding the net impact of currency translation, our operational earnings per share was $1.90 or up 6.7%. There were no significant non-GAAP adjustments in the 2015 second quarter other than the exclusion of the expense for amortization of intangible assets.","Now, let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. As we have said before, we would use any gain from divestitures in 2015 to offset the lower earnings impact of not having the OLYSIO sales uptake we had in 2014 and to provide some offset to currency headwinds, while also allowing continued investment for future growth. This quarter\u2019s results reflect just that. Cost of goods sold was 90 basis points lower than the same period last year mainly due to favorable product mix somewhat offset by currency impacts.","Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 30.3% of sales or 220 basis points higher as compared to the second quarter of 2014. We are investing in a responsible manner and the absolute spending level is comparable to the prior year mainly due to the impact of currency as we continue investment spending behind our key brands on a global basis. The prior year percent to sales level was artificially lower since there was very little spending in relation to OLYSIO sales. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12% and 170 basis points higher than the prior year as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth.","Interest expense, net of interest income, was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of $900 million in the quarter compared to a net charge of $200 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $1.1 billion compared to a net gain of $300 million in the prior year period. This quarter we recorded the gain on the previously announced divestiture of the NUCYNTA product.","Excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, the effective tax rate for the 6-month period was 22.3% compared to 21.1% in the same period last year. As I noted during our call in April, the effective tax rate this quarter is again higher than our guidance for the year as it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit as that legislation has not yet been passed although we expect that it will be. The effective tax rate is higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of the mix of earnings being higher in the United States this year.","Now, I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast beginning with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $15 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $19 billion of debt. I am pleased to report that we completed our share repurchase program to help offset the ongoing impact of the OCD divestiture. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a gain ranging from approximately $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. This is slightly higher than our previous guidance. As a reminder, this includes the gain from the divestiture of the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA pain medicine as well as the anticipated gain on the pending divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health, which we expect will close towards the end of 2015, subject to regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. We have also refined our estimates for the items in this account now that we are halfway through the year.","As I also noted in April, the guidance for other income and expense will flow through to increase operational earnings as we expect to use this other income to compensate for the decreased income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014 as well as to help mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds this year, while we also continue to invest in our core business and opportunities for future growth.","And now, a word on taxes, our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress although that has not yet occurred. We would, therefore, be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015, excluding special items, of approximately 21% to 22% consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax credit is not approved that would negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015.","Now, turning to guidance on sales and earnings, consistent with our previous guidance for sales, our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA, but we are expecting a generic entrant for INVEGA in 2015. As expected, we have seen additional biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe, following the patent expiration in many countries in February of this year. As we have done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. It\u2019s the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.","We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Consistent with our previous guidance, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion.","Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2014, our operational sales growth for 2015, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of hepatitis C products, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014. And just to note, we are monitoring the situation in Greece as the country considers its path forward economically. We do not anticipate any significant negative impact to our sales results for 2015, nor to our earnings for 2015, unless there is a significant change in the current expected resolution.","As of last week, the euro was lower by approximately 17% as compared to 2014 average levels and the dollar has strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. And though we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year, our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 7%, reflecting the weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect a change in the range between negative 5% and negative 6% for a total expected level of reported sales of between approximately $70 billion to $71 billion. This is consistent with our previous guidance.","And now turning to earnings, a significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions. And although they are hedged, it is still somewhat negatively incremental versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 60 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range between $6.70 to $6.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 5% to 6%. This is higher than our previous guidance as we have increased the lower end of the range, reflecting some operational improvements in the business and our confidence at this point in the year.","Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.60 per share, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range between $6.10 to $6.20 per share. At this stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which is higher than our previous guidance.","So, in summary, as you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, I would like to make a few key points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2%, we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C products, our operational sales growth at the midpoint of our guidance is a solid 6% for the full year 2015 as compared to 5% for 2014.","And with regard to earnings, on a constant currency basis, our guidance on operational EPS growth is strong and in the range of between 5% and 6%. And finally, as we execute on our growth plans, we are continuing to make portfolio choices and investments in our business, particularly in research and development as we continue to build our pipelines across the enterprise, which will position us for sustained future growth.","And now, I would like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. And Holly, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Novarro","Good morning. Question for Alex, in your first couple of years, Alex, you\u2019ve spent a lot of time with divestitures divesting cardio devices, diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and consumer brands. As you look at the enterprise now, do you think we are finished with the divestitures? Question one. And question two do we now enter a period where the company is more focused on acquisitions? Thank you.","Alex Gorsky","Hey, good morning Glenn, Alex here and thank you very much for your question. Glenn, 3 years ago when we started looking at our strategies going forward, we tried to outline a very clear path ahead that would really consist of multiple components. One is obviously continuing to invest in our organic businesses, both in sales and marketing and research and development and I think we demonstrated that in spite of a lot of different puts and takes that we have continued to do that in a responsible way as Dominic outlined earlier when he was taking you through the P&L. An area where we did have a lot of focus was on making sure that our businesses were competitive, then of course, we tried to be very clear in that criteria there that look we want to be number one and number two in the marketplace. We want to have a clear innovation or technology path to really help patients or consumers or very importantly, we wanted the business to be complementary to something else that we are doing in another area of the enterprise and of course just fundamentally be a strong business. And if they didn\u2019t meet those criteria, then of course we consider other options where they maybe better served in someone else\u2019s hands. And as you noted, we have demonstrated that we are willing to do that as well. We think that\u2019s an ongoing process in the business. We would expect there, business our size is in excess of $70 billion involved in the numerous platforms. That\u2019s something that you will see as part of our natural cadence and flow going forward. But clearly, we are always also interested in growth opportunities. And when we see strong innovations that really make a difference for patients that also where we feel it offers a great complement to one of our existing franchises or frankly a platform for significant growth into the future, we have got the balance sheet, we have got the wherewithal to make those investments and that\u2019s always the priority for us and will remain so into the future.","Glenn Novarro","And just as a follow-up to that, if you look at the pipeline of M&A potential, number one, would you call the pipeline meaningful, in other words there are a lot of rich targets out there. And then as you look at these targets, what do you see in terms of the valuation of these targets, are these targets getting stretched and is that maybe one of the reasons why you haven\u2019t done as much M&A here in the last few years? Thank you.","Alex Gorsky","No Glenn, thank you. Look, we do feel that there are several significant opportunities really across each one of our segments that offer potential for growth and that are consistent with the strategic outline that I mentioned earlier. At the same time, I think we demonstrated that we want to be thoughtful and disciplined about our approach. And we intend to continue that path going forward.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Kristen.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, good morning everybody. I was just wondering Dominic, if you can maybe just walk us through just again with the disposition of Cordis, just kind of what you are assuming in terms of timing of the sale of the business and then the dilution, how we should think about that, should we think about that similar with the OCD business in terms of the use of the proceeds perhaps with another round of repurchase to offset dilution again or kind of how we are thinking still about cardiovascular?","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Kristen. Well, we expect that the Cordis divestiture will close in the latter part of the year. We still have some regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. So we would expect that towards the end of the year, that\u2019s been consistent with our previous discussion, nothing has changed there. The dilution of not having Cordis as part of the business is not that significant, quite frankly not as much as it was for OCD. As you know, that business after we exited the drug-eluting stent business is a relatively small portion of our business. And then with respect to use of proceeds, as we do typically when we do divestitures we wait after the transactions are complete, look at other opportunities we have for the use of cash and then make our decisions then as we prepare our plans for the coming year. So as of now, I really can\u2019t comment on what we might do with any of the proceeds.","Alex Gorsky","Hi, Kristen, this is Alex. I just might also add that cardiovascular remains an area of strategic importance for us. We have a very strong Biosense Webster business. In fact, if you look at the quarterly performance for the second quarter, which is once again double-digit. I think this reflects almost 3 years or 4 years now of consecutive improvements in that performance at a very similar level, a great flow of new technologies that\u2019s really making a difference for patients. We also think cardiovascular, so look it still remains a global healthcare issue with a lot of innovation. So it\u2019s an area where we remain interested and we still feel we have very solid footing with our Biosense Webster EP business.","Kristen Stewart","Got it. And then just maybe can you give us a little more color just on REMICADE, I know that that\u2019s obviously been a key concern of investors just what you are seeing in the quarter and kind of expectations ahead just with respect to the business over in Europe with biosimilars?","Louise Mehrotra","So in the quarter, Kristen we had in the export sales, we actually had an inventory change that negatively impacted the reported results there for the pharmaceutical group by about 2%, what we are seeing in Europe is as expected, so for the countries that went off patent in February 2015, we are seeing about market share for the biosimilars in the mid single-digits, so as expected.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Hi, good morning. Let me turn to the pharma side for a minute, I think two products that people focused on in the first half of the year for impact of the competition were STELARA and INVOKANA, INVOKANA looks like the momentum has continued and continues to look fantastic, STELARA looks like it slowed this quarter, so could you just comment on both?","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Mike, Alex. Look, we still see STELARA growth at over 15%, strong growth in the U.S. and particularly strong growth outside of the United States at almost 27%. There was a slight sequential decrease in share we are projecting, but overall if we look at the competitive profile of the product, how we are doing combined, frankly with our overall franchise presence that we see in this area, we remain really confident in it.","Mike Weinstein","And any comments on INVOKANA?","Alex Gorsky","INVOKANA is the same, I think look we continue to highlight the profile. We have a got great reimbursement, well in excess of 50% to 60% in both commercial as well as the Medicare side of the business. We have continued to see strong TRx trends, both in primary care well as endocrinology. So overall, we are seeing strong uptake and we think it\u2019s a big opportunity, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Alex, while I have got you here, it\u2019s been 3 years since you guys closed the Synthes acquisition and I am sure as you commented, you are not thrilled by the first half performance in trauma and spine, so can you just talk a little bit about how you are feeling about that deal and what it will take to get it back on track? Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. Look, overall we absolutely believe it was the right move when to bring Synthes in and create the largest and most diversified Orthopaedics company. And when we reflect back there, there have been changes that have taken place in the market. One is just the market growth across all these segments. If you remember back in 2008, 2009, 2010, we saw high single-digit growth really for our hips, knees, trauma as well as spine. That has changed significantly. We are now seeing that in the 3% to 4% range. I am pleased with the performance overall that we have seen through the integration. Whenever you bring two large organizations together, there is always a lot of moving pieces. But I think over the last 3 years if you take a look at the overall disruption and the way that we have been able to manage it, I think the team has done a very good job. And now we are really focused on what do we do to ensure that we are best positioned for the future. And frankly, we are doing it at a time when a lot of our competitors are just getting ready to go through a significant amount of integration and transition.","And this is where we are excited. And I think it starts with innovation. We have had a nice cadence of innovation. In fact, we are in the midst \u2013 we just launched the TFNA, the transfemoral nail in trauma that we are excited about. We think will be an important addition to the bag \u2013 to the portfolio that part of the business. In the U.S., we were encouraged by the performance that we saw in knees and hips at 5% and 4% growth, respectively for the quarter. And also going forward, I think we are also quite excited about the opportunity to work with customers in new, unique and different ways across that portfolio. And I also think it\u2019s fair to say that in all those areas we are going to continue to look for ways to drive that business through innovation, but also through increasing our effectiveness and efficiencies across all areas as well. So I think we are pleased, we are not satisfied, there is more work that we need to do and that\u2019s where we are focused right now.","Mike Weinstein","Thanks Alex.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning Larry.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two clarifications, on the utilization comments about the fourth consecutive quarter of improving utilization, is that through Q1 or Q2. And then second on REMICADE outside the U.S., by our math we had total international and export sales growth in Q2 down about 18% constant currency, Louise you talked about that 2% impact from the inventory reduction, was that to that 18 or so percent, was that just the REMICADE outside the U.S., could you help clarify those two points, that would be great? And I have just one follow-up for Alex after that.","Louise Mehrotra","So Larry, that 2% is on total pharmaceutical sales. So, it\u2019s a large reduction in the inventory.","Larry Biegelsen","Total worldwide pharma?","Louise Mehrotra","Yes, yes.","Larry Biegelsen","Okay. And then on the utilization, was that through Q1 or Q2?","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Larry, Alex here. That was through Q2. And again, you know this data as well as we do and we are trying to triangulate from multiple different sources, but what we see is, for example, around 4% growth in hospital admissions. If you take a look at hospital surgical procedures, we are thinking probably between 2.5% and 3% and if we look at overall outpatient procedure growth, probably around 3%. So, it\u2019s still positive. In some cases, it\u2019s flat, perhaps a slight decrease versus what we saw in Q1, but we think overall the trends are relatively constant what we have seen thus far.","Larry Biegelsen","Good, good. That\u2019s helpful. And I appreciate your comments earlier on M&A and the M&A environment, but you have $15 billion in net cash, which is obviously not earning much. I know your first priority for cash is the dividend and then M&A. But at what point do you consider using your cash to repurchase shares, Alex? Thanks for taking the questions.","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Larry. I think look overall, ultimately, we want to create more value for shareholders. And as we look at our capital allocation strategy you just iterated, we have a strong commitment to dividends. We have done that for a long time. You know our statistics and our track record there. Regarding M&A, it\u2019s also another area obviously that we keep our eye on. I mentioned earlier in the discussion that we are always looking for the right opportunity and we try to do that in a balanced approach. Of course, we want innovation. Of course, we want complementary things to add to our portfolio of growth opportunities, but we also want to ensure that we maintain the discipline and the perspective of our approach that I think has served us well over a lot of years. And even if you look at the internal versus external investment in the company, I think if you look over a 20, a 10 or even the near-term period, about 45% of our growth comes from what I call organic investment in our research and development versus slightly over half through M&A. And so that will continue to be our approach.","Dominic Caruso","Also Larry, I would say that if you look at it over long periods of time, I think we are very proud of the fact that over a decade, we have returned about 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders. So, I think it\u2019s important to keep that in mind although we may be evaluating opportunities all the time, we are always mindful of the fact of appropriate return to shareholders consistently over long periods of time.","Alex Gorsky","Yes. And I think even recently through some of the announcements that we have made about share repurchases, we have demonstrated that, that\u2019s part of our mix and we will continue to be so going forward.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Jami.","Jami Rubin","Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of follow-up questions on sort of the major themes of the earnings call, Alex and I appreciate your taking the time to be on the call. Just if you look at the MD&D business, the MD&D business has underperformed its peers for at least the last 4 to 5 years and maybe longer, I am not sure, but I can\u2019t imagine you are pleased with that performance. And I am just wondering, what is your interest level in moving up the technology curve out of what you are in which are mostly commodity businesses? When I look across where the major growth opportunities are in MedTech, you guys aren\u2019t there, robotics, transcatheter heart valves, et cetera. So, I appreciate valuations are high and you want to be disciplined, but at the same time, J&J\u2019s MD&D business continues to under perform. So, if you could comment on that, please? And then secondly to you, Dominic, you are looking about $2 billion in non-operating income in 2015 largely related to divestitures, how do you repeat that performance in 2016 without creating again a very difficult comparison? Thanks very much.","Alex Gorsky","Hey, Jamie, thank you for the questions. Look, first of all, as I said regarding our medical device businesses, we think this is an important business and remains a very solid growth opportunity going forward. And look as you look across that entire business, we have a number of very exciting areas, frankly, that are doing quite well. We highlighted some of them earlier whether it\u2019s Biosense Webster, whether it\u2019s what we are seeing in areas like biosurgicals, energy, our Endocutter business, we are starting to see the turnaround in areas such as vision care and we don\u2019t think those are commodity businesses. We think those are driven by innovation, technology, and they have been a steady strain. Now, are there other areas where we are interested? Well, you know that we have made an investment in the robotics space. We have announced an exciting opportunity with Google. It\u2019s still early days. We recognized that, but we think that there is a lot of opportunity there given our expertise in general surgery overall and combining it with some of the expertise that those new technology partners can add. And we are also interested in other areas beyond that. We have demonstrated the ability in the past that when we see them, we will participate and acquire them. And I think we have also demonstrated over the past few years that in areas where we don\u2019t see that path forward that we will be active on the divestiture front as well. So, we think that there is room for improvement. We know that we have got businesses like diabetes care, for example that had a significant impact from pricing a few years ago, vision care, that\u2019s still in the midst of a turnaround, but we think that we have got the strategies, the innovation in place to turn those around, and these can be very solid and strong performance going forward.","Dominic Caruso","And Jami, with respect to the other income and expenses, $2 billion roughly that you quoted, I think we were very clear early in the year that we were going to use those divestiture gains to offset some pretty significant headwinds and in particular the major headwind of currency this year. Going forward, I don\u2019t believe we will have the same level of divestiture income, but we will still have some. As Alex have mentioned earlier, we are continuously reviewing our portfolio and making decisions of where we want to participate and where we think the assets would be better off in someone else\u2019s hands and where we could get value for our shareholders by selling the assets. So, I think for \u201816, we would still see some level of divestiture income, but again in \u201816 versus \u201815, we won\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t believe we will have the significant headwinds of currency that we just experienced in \u201815 nor will we have the tough comparisons of not having OLYSIO. So, I think you will continue to see it as part of our strategy to reevaluate our portfolio and deploy those gains against higher growth opportunities.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. And I just want to clarify something on the inventory for the pharmaceuticals. The 2% negative impact includes also some inventory reductions for OLYSIO. So, if you just look at the REMICADE export, total U.S. impact would be about 1%, about half of that, okay? Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Jennings","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I would like to have first one for Dominic, just as we look into 2016 and beyond and the annualization of OLYSIO and other headwinds experienced in \u201815, how should we be thinking about leveraging the P&L driving a higher level of EPS growth relative to revenue growth? Should we be anticipating consistent constant currency EPS growth in 100, 200 basis points range or could that spread improve as you experience operating improvements in consumer and the device franchises and the continued strength in the pharma unit?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, thanks, Josh. Well, as we have said many times, we always plan our business to grow our top line at a rate faster than the competitive set and then grow the bottom line at a rate of growth that\u2019s slightly faster than the top line growth. That depends each year on what investments we want to make to continue the growth trajectory of the business. So, I can\u2019t give you a formula to think about, but I think you have seen us be very consistent in our ability to continue to grow earnings at a rate that\u2019s appropriately at a level faster than sales, again, depending on what the market is doing and then depending on what particular investments we have. We do see increased profitability in the consumer business, but as you mentioned it in your comments and Sandi had referred to it earlier, now that we are through many of the issues in the consent decree, we saw the increase in the profitability last year and we expect that business will continue to contribute more profitability in the future.","Josh Jennings","Thanks. And just a follow-up on the pharma product specific question, there is some recent ANDA filers for ZYTIGA, can you just talk about any inherent risk of a generic coming to the U.S. market prior to \u201816 and just an update on your patent positioning for that asset? Thanks a lot.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. So, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, the composition of matter patent expires in December 2016 and the method of treatment patent expires in August 2027. We would not speculate on any ANDA approval timing or outcome of any litigation. However, if we decide to file a lawsuit, the 30-month stay would begin April 2016 at the earliest and the length of which will be of course subject to any outcome of any litigation.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you and next question.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning Vamil.","Vamil Divan","Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So just two here, if I could. One, you talked a little bit about INVOKANA earlier, I know Mike asked about this as well, but just about halfway through the quarter, we did have the FDA comment around ketoacidosis and just curious I mean obviously performance was fine this quarter but any on a qualitative basis it gives sense from any sort of questions or changes in prescribing habits as a result of what the FDA has stated at this point. And then second, I appreciate your comments on Greece, I was just curious also regarding Puerto Rico, just some of that kind of macro issues that are going on there I know you guys have some manufacturing down there, do you sense any sort of risk or concerns there depending how that sort of plays out over the next few weeks or months?","Louise Mehrotra","We will take first the questions on the DKA, it\u2019s early on, but our Phase 3 trial is actually included about 10,000 patients and we saw very few cases of it.","Alex Gorsky","Right. And with respect to Puerto Rico, you are right we have a significant manufacturing presence there and significant employment on the island, of course as a result. But I don\u2019t see that as a major factor in our ability to continue progressing with our plans. So it's not on our radar screen as a major issue to contend with.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I think I heard Alex mention $1 billion in cost savings by 2018, I just wanted a little clarity, is that a new program or is that a program that I thought you introduced a couple of years ago?","Dominic Caruso","This is Dominic, Jayson. It\u2019s the program that we introduced a couple of years ago. We are a couple of years into it now and so we are already seeing some of those cost benefits. And Alex is describing the same program where we the looked that by 2018 if you compared it to base year of 2013, the overall cost reduction would be in the aggregate of $1 billion.","Jayson Bedford","And how far along are you, are you at 50%, 60%?","Dominic Caruso","We kicked it off in \u201813. We did a lot of planning, of course in \u201814. So we are just starting to ramp it up this year into the next couple of years.","Jayson Bedford","Okay. And then maybe a question for Sandi on the consumer side, you have added investment over the last few years to support the are-launch of the OTC products, but margin seem to improve nicely over the last few quarters, does the added investment wind down to generate better margins or just the growth pick up to improve margins?","Sandi Peterson","Thanks for the question. The way in which we are looking at this is the \u2013 as we are sun-setting the consent decree, it enables us to improve the productivity of our manufacturing footprint. So a large part of where you will see continued improvement in the profitability of the business is by improving our COGS and our gross margins for the business. So that\u2019s one aspect of it. The other aspect of it is we are \u2013 we have undertaken over the last couple of years an approach to globalize our brands and to globalize how we manage them, which drives increased efficiency in every single marketing dollar. So our perspective on this is we need to continue to invest behind these brands, both the U.S. OTC portfolio as well as the global portfolio. So you will not see us reduce our investments behind our brand building of all of our core brands, but what you will see is improved leverage in our manufacturing footprint and actually how we are spending those dollars to drive improved profitability across the sector.","Alex Gorsky","Jason, this is Alex. If I can just add, I really want to commend Sandi and Jorge and their teams for the job that they are doing on these re-launches. I think when we were having these calls several years ago, there was probably a fair amount of skepticism on our ability to re-launch against private label, making sure that we can work our way through the consent decree requirements. And if you look at the progress that\u2019s been made over the past few years, obviously it starts with great products. I think now we have over 80% of our brands return to the shelf, a lot of new recent launches, particularly along the TYLENOL line. If you combine that with the way that we have achieved all the consent decree requirements, I think we worked closely with the agency. We have done that. In fact, I think we will be the \u2013 if not the one of the only large over-the-counter companies to ever be able to do that successfully. And really good news is that when you look \u2013 as we re-launch these brands, the share uptake is strong. I think we are back up to now about 60% of the share that we achieved in areas like pain. So we are building our way back up. And when you combine that with some of the new innovations that we have, we definitely see a nice growth opportunity in that part of the business.","Louise Mehrotra","So with respect to everyone\u2019s time, we will take two more questions. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning David.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks Louise for squeezing me in, maybe just a question for Alex and Sandi and a quick follow-up for Dominic, but the Consumer business is clearly recovering, that\u2019s the big message I think of this call and I think the commentary, I think you have made publicly these last few months seems to be that for M&A in Consumer, it\u2019s going to center more on brands and not company, so you see more willing in consumer at least from our estimation to rule out large M&A, am I reading that right and why is that the case?","Sandi Peterson","So our first \u2013 the way in which we are thinking about acquisitions in consumer is a combination of things. We are going to clearly stay focused on our priority consumer need states and geographies. So the way we look at it is a combination, are there brands that are appropriate to tuck into our infrastructure to drive growth in certain markets or in certain areas at the consumer need state. But we also will look at technologies that we can license in like we have done in other parts of J&J. And lastly, we do look at companies to acquire, whether they are mid-size companies or whether they are larger companies. And we are highly disciplined about looking at those and understanding the benefit of doing those kinds of larger acquisitions versus mid-size or smaller acquisitions. So we haven\u2019t ruled out any particular part of the marketplace. We are looking at a variety of different opportunities given that the business is now stabilizing, growing again. We believe we are sort of in a position where we can look at these things a little bit more on an ongoing basis.","Alex Gorsky","Yes. And David, I would just add onto that that the Consumer area remains one of strong strategic importance for Johnson & Johnson. When you think about the role of consumers and healthcare utilization going forward, when you think about the way that you are able to drive innovation and frankly when you think about the reach that it gives you, particularly in the emerging markets and the fast growing markets. And by the way, for Johnson & Johnson, it not only operates that way to drive growth in consumer, but it acts also as a way to increase our uptake in our other businesses, particularly in those growth markets. We think there are a lot of opportunities. And I think mission one over the past few years has been getting it on the right track. As you mentioned yourself, we think we made a lot of progress there. We are feeling much, much better. And now we are obviously looking for ways how do we expand that, how do we take it to the next level.","David Lewis","Okay, very helpful. Thank you for that color. And then, Dominic just a quick question, I am just thinking about international growth, this quarter was a little slower, I am just wondering if you can give us an update on what you are seeing macro in emerging markets maybe specifically China just given the events the last month, have you seen any acute slowdown or is it relatively stable? Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","So we have seen in China some slowdown. I wouldn\u2019t call it acute. There are some dynamics, of course of generic competition in China and an overall slower growth in economic growth. So we are seeing that, but I think we are well positioned. We have been in China for many, many years. We have a good footprint there. We obviously manufacture there as well and our brands continue to get good uptick there. And of course, we are not in the generic part of the pharmaceutical business in China because we are focused more on innovation in that market. So I wouldn\u2019t call it acute, but I would say we have seen some slowdown in the overall market growth in China.","David Lewis","Thank you very much.","Louise Mehrotra","Last question please.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise","Thanks so much for taking the question. Good morning everybody. Alex, maybe just a question for you and then one for Sandi, you talked again and you highlighted your focus on the OR the future and talking about the Google JV and robotics, can you maybe give us a little more concrete color, I mean is there a grand plan, does it require acquisitions, are we going to see some tangible products or launches that are going to impact sales and earnings over the next 6 months to 12 months, how do you want us to think about it?","Alex Gorsky","Rick, when you think about this as a really strategic investment in the future for robotic surgery and we \u2013 as we see the surgical suite continue to develop in today\u2019s environment, I would say there is a pretty clear line of demarcation between what you would say as standard surgery and robotic surgery. And we think as technology develops in the future, whether it\u2019s real-time data collection, whether it\u2019s visualization, whether it\u2019s incorporating some of the new technologies in areas, such as energy and hemostats, combining these in very new and unique approaches we think offers a real significant opportunity to improve patient outcomes ultimately to grow our business. We also think there was some inherent limitations to today\u2019s robotic surgery environment when you frankly look at the size and the scale of some of the existing innovation. And if you look at what\u2019s happened with other technology platforms as they have become smaller, more flexible, more mobile, and frankly have a better ability to integrate various activities around the OR, that\u2019s where we think we can really make a difference. We realize, of course, that we bring certain capabilities to the table, but we are also thinking \u2013 working with partners like Google and others. It expands our capabilities significantly. And so, look, we see this as really not something to have an impact, where I would say over the next 6 to 12 months, this is likely more over a 2-year to 3-year plus timeframe, but we \u2013 this is something that we are quite committed to that our partners are committed to and that we see as a real opportunity to fundamentally change the way we think about surgery and robotics in the future.","Rick Wise","I really appreciate that. And just last quickly, Sandi, I mean, it seems clear that VIBE is off to a strong start, I think you launched it in the U.S. late last year, maybe just talk if you could give us a little more color on the rollout where are you, are you fully rolled out, are you converting your own patients to VIBE, or are you gaining new accounts just \u2013 and maybe what\u2019s next beyond VIBE? Thanks so much.","Sandi Peterson","Thanks. So, as you \u2013 in insulin delivery in total, what we have done is as you know we have launched the product in Europe and also in Canada over the last couple of years. And both in Europe and in Canada, it also has a pediatric indication, which clearly gives it some unique differentiation in the marketplace. We effectively launched it in the United States really at the beginning of this year. So, we have seen significant positive growth in uptake of the product in the U.S., which is a combination of existing patients upgrading to the new product as well as gaining new \u2013 basically new to therapy insulin pumpers as well as there we have seen a lot of conversion from other pump platforms to our platform. We, in the second quarter, also filed for the pediatric indication for the U.S. product. And so obviously, the FDA will go through its review process, but we are hopeful that before the end of this year, we should have the pediatric indication, which will be a further uptick in the business in the U.S. and be very helpful to us in the U.S.","As I also mentioned earlier, there is two other things in insulin delivery that we are very focused on, actually three, but two of them are working in partnership with Dexcom on a next-generation pump that really brings the best of what we have learned of how to make this much more user-friendly and effective with a patient as well as ensuring that we have got the right algorithm in the pump for insulin delivery. Combining that with the next generation of sensor, our current pump has that with Dexcom. And then we are also and have done a lot of work not just in the insulin side, but also in the BGM side of really creating a much better ecosystem for the patient to have information and data that helps them manage their condition much more effectively. And so we are using information technology in a smarter way going forward and we are seeing very positive impact of that, not just in the insulin delivery side, but in our core BGM business. So, that\u2019s another place that we will see a number of different things that we are going to be doing in this business. And last but not least, I mentioned that the Calibra patch pump is another great growth platform we believe for us, because it\u2019s really a unique to the marketplace way to help type 2 diabetics who are insulin-dependent, have a new way of getting their insulin delivered to them in a much more discreet way. So, there are lot of things in the works, there is a lot of things in our pipeline in insulin delivery.","Rick Wise","Appreciate it. Thanks.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. We will have some closing remarks by Alex.","Alex Gorsky","Okay. Well, thank you everyone. And look, in closing, I want to again extend our appreciation to all of you for joining today\u2019s meeting. We are pleased with the solid results we reported this morning, which as we discussed today, really do reflect the strong underlying growth we are seeing across the enterprise. And when you combine this with the actions we have taken to even further strengthen our core businesses and advance our pipeline, Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned to continue to drive growth over the long-term. So, I wish everyone a great day and thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing first quarter for the corporation and for our three business segments. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2015. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements.

Worldwide sales to customers were $17.4 billion for the first quarter of 2015, down 4.1% versus the first quarter of 2014. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.1% and currency had a negative impact of 7.2%. In the U.S., sales were up 5.9%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 0.8%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 13.2%.","On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 9.9%, while Europe grew 0.3% and Asia Pacific Africa declined 3%. Growth in the U.S. and Japan was negatively impacted by hepatitis C completion or growth in all regions was impacted by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying operational growth was 5.7% worldwide, 9.1% in the U.S. and 3% outside the U.S.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.53 versus $1.64 a year-ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $226 million and a net gain of $128 million for after-tax special items.","Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.56, representing decreases of 5.9% and 4.3% respectively as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translations significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings grew 3.7%.","Turning now to business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact. I\u2019ll begin with the consumer segment.","Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 3.4% with U.S. sales up 3.8%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 3.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 4.7% worldwide, 5.1% in the U.S. and 4.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, Skin Care, as well as Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health outside the U.S.","OTC sales growth was driven by analgesics, upper respiratory products outside the U.S. as well as new products and re-launches in Digestive Health, Anti-smoking aids and ROGAINE. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12% up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. paediatric share was nearly 43%, up from nearly 38% a year ago.","In Skin Care seasonal inventory build and strong market growth drove results for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women\u2019s Health products outside the U.S.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.7 billion increased 10.2% with U.S. sales up 16.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.7%, driven by both strong sales of new products, as well as core growth products. New competitors in Hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter.","Excluding sales of Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying pharmaceutical growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 13%, 24% and 3% respectively. U.S. results include a positive adjustment for growth to net including managed Medicaid rebates. Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA as well as INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET, XARELTO, IMBRUVICA, ZYTIGA, CONCERTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION.","The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, complemented by increased market share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. Regarding REMICADE export and international sales, as a reminder the company made certain supply changes resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales being recorded as international sales. Combined international and export sales for REMICADE in the first quarter of 2015 were down approximately 2%. Strong growth in Canada was offset by lower sales to our distributors reflecting the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe partially offset by an inventory build.","INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 40% on a sequential basis. In the U.S. INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET achieved 4.9% TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and Metformin, up from 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. TRx with endocrinologist grew to 11.8% for the quarter, and 4.3% in primary care, up 1.5% and 0.7% respectively on a sequential basis.","INVOKANA\/INVOKAMET remains the category-leader in new-to-brand share with endocrinologists at nearly 18% at the end of the quarter.","XARELTO sales were up 38% and total prescription share of TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anti coagulant market grew to 15%, up over 3 points from a year ago. TRx and primary care reached 12% and in cardiology 23.8% up on a sequential basis.","XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of Commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. Strong patient update with new indications approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. primarily Europe with launches in Germany, France and the U.K. ","Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer or mCRPC market at 12.5% drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA\u2019s share was approximately 30.3% of that market down approximately 1.2 points on a sequential basis due to increased competition.","During the quarter the FDA approved a label update for ZYTIGA plus prednisone noting significantly prolonged median overall survival compared to placebo plus prednisone, in chemo-na\u00efve men with mCRPC.","Continued strong market uptake and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 95 countries. CONCERTA growth was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalent reclassification of generic competitors. INVEGA, SUSTENNA or XEPLION, achieved strong result in all regions due primarily to increased market share.","I\u2019ll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.3 billion decreased 4.6%. U.S. sales declined 6.1%, while sales outside the U.S declined 3.3%. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was divested mid-year 2014.","Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestures, underlying operational growth was 1.3% worldwide, with the U.S up 1.1% and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by orthopaedics, cardiovascular care, surgical care and diabetes care partially offset by lower sales in vision care. Competitive pricing dynamics and buying patterns negatively impacted growth for vision care.","Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in Sports Medicine as well as trauma hips and knees partially offset by competitive and pricing challenges in the U.S in spine.","Trauma growth of 3% Worldwide was driven by 7% growth outside the U.S. due to strong volume growth including a tender. Hips growth of 3% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth partially offset by continued pricing pressure.","Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Knees worldwide increased 1% with the U.S. up 2% due to strong sales of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure.","Outside the U.S. knees were down 1% with growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America offset by lower sales in Europe. Slowing elective procedure volume primarily in the U.K contributed to the soft sales in Europe. Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 12% worldwide increase in Electrophysiology business due to strong sales of the ThermoCool SmartTouch Catheter.","Surgical care growth was driven by strong future growth and the success of new products in the ECHELON FLEX family partially offset by lower sales in Women\u2019s Health. Results for diabetes care were driven by ANIMAS strong double digit growth with the successful launch of VIBE in the U.S. and expanded paediatric indications outside the U.S. ","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter of 2015. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Louise and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our strong start to 2015 and I believe we are well positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare environment. At Johnson & Johnson we continue to make very good progress on our near term priorities as well as our long term growth drivers which we discussed during our January call. I\u2019ll take the next few minutes to highlight some key developments we\u2019ve made to advance our business as well as some key points regarding our results for the quarter and then I\u2019ll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2015.","During the quarter we had several key developments across our business. We received new approvals for IMBRUVICA, PREZCOBIX and VELCADE in our pharmaceutical business and also added a new anti-thrombin antibody to our early stage development pipeline through the acquisition of XO1 Limited which we announced last month.","We also continued expanding our efforts to combat major global public health challenges through collaborations with government organization and others in the industry to search for new solutions to stand the threats posed by dementia and Ebola.","In much more in-depth preview of the outstanding work our pharmaceutical business is doing will be provided at our upcoming pharmaceutical business review meeting on May 20th which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey.","In Medical devices in line with our priority to accelerate growth through innovation we announced in March definitive agreement to collaborate with Google Life Sciences to advance development of a surgical robotics program which we see as an important step in our commitment to advancing surgical care around the world.","Finally we continued making disciplined decisions regarding the management of our enterprise portfolio and completed our divestiture of the U.S. Licensing rights for NUCYNTA in April. We announced the binding offer from Cardinal Health to acquire our Cordis business which we expect to close in the latter part of the year.","Please now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. We are very pleased with the strong start to the year as reflected in our first quarter results. While overall sales results were impacted by currency headwinds our operational sales growth was 3.1% and our operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a strong 5.7%. Competition in the Hepatitis C market negatively impacted that growth by a full percentage point. You may recall that this same analysis for 2014 resulted in underlying operational growth of 5%, so we are very pleased to see underlying operational growth accelerating and very healthy.","Now if you please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 exceeded the mean of the analyst estimate as published by Firstcall.","The decline in adjusted EPS of 4.3% versus the prior year was entirely due to the negative impact of movements and currency rates in the translation of our results, particularly the weakening of the euro compared to the prior year. This resulted in a negative impact to EPS in the quarter of approximately $0.13 per share. EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.69 or up 3.7% over the prior year. This is slightly higher than our operational sales growth rate of 3.1%.","As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures the 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items which consisted primarily of the following. Intangible asset amortization expense was approximately $200 million, net litigation gains were approximately $250 million and we had an increase in the accrual for the DePuy ASR Hip program of approximately $100 million.","Now let\u2019s take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased 30 basis points; this is mostly due to currency impacts. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 27.9% of sales or 70 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2014 due to good cost management.","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.9% and it was higher than the prior year, as we continue to make important investments for the future. Overall, our pre-tax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.6% or 50 basis points lower than the prior year primarily due to such R&D investments.","Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. And other income and expense was a net gain of $348 million in the quarter compared to a net charge of $86 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $91 million compared to a net gain of $50 million in the prior year period.","Now excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.5% compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. This effective tax rate is higher than our previous guidance as it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit as that legislation has not yet been passed.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $12 billion of net cash which consist of approximately $31 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $19 billion of debt. I\u2019m also pleased to report that we have made significant progress and nearly completed our share repurchase program which will offset the ongoing impact of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics divestiture we did last year.","For purposes of your model and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I\u2019d suggest you consider modelling net interest expense between $450 million and $550 million; this is unchanged from our prior guidance.","Regarding other income and expense as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as a gain ranging from approximately $2 billion to $2.1 billion, which includes the gain from the divestiture of our U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine which we announced close in the early second quarter and we\u2019ve updated our guidance now to reflect the anticipated gain on the pending divestiture of the Cordis business.","As we noted in January, we expect to use the increase in other income to compensate for the anticipated decrease in income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014 while continuing to invest in our core business and opportunities for future growth. We firmly believe that continued portfolio decisions are an important process and enable us to focus our resources on the highest growth opportunities.","With the anticipated Cordis gain we will be able to mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds this year. The increase in guidance for other income and expense will flow directly through to increase operational earnings versus our prior guidance.","And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress, although that has not happened. We therefore will be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2015 excluding special items of approximately 20% to 21%. This is higher than our previous guidance reflecting changes in the mix of our earnings. If the R&D tax credit is not approved it would negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015.","Now turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2015 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models.","Consistent with our previous guidance for sales our assumptions for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA, but we are expecting the generic entrant for INVEGA in 2015. As expected, we have seen additional biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe following the patent exploration in many countries in February.","As we\u2019ve done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2015 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.","Consistent with our previous guidance we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we describe our sales results in 2014 our operational sales growth for 2015 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of Hepatitis C would be approximately 6% a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014 which we noted earlier.","As of last week the euro was lower by approximately 17% as compared to 2014 average levels and the dollar has strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. And though we are not predicting the impact of currency movements to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 7% reflecting the weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar.","Now turning to earnings, a significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency movements on transactions which although hedged, is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 60 to 70 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014.","Consistent with the reporting practices by the majority of our competitors as we explained last quarter we now exclude intangible, amortization expense in addition to special items when providing our adjusted earnings guidance and actual results.","Accordingly, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.64 to $6.79 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 4% to 6%, this is higher than our previous guidance by $0.10 per share reflecting some operational improvements and the higher other income and expense I noted earlier partially offset by higher tax rate.","Again, we are not impacting \u2013 we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week, that our reported earnings per share would be negatively impacted by approximately $60 per share, which is a higher negative impact of approximately $0.18 per share than we provided in our January guidance.","Therefore our reported adjusted EPS range will range from $6.04 to $6.19 per share primarily due to the increased headwind of currency on ESP of $0.18 per share which is partially offset by our improved operating performance of approximately $0.10 per share.","At this stage and year we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. So, in summary as update you models for the guidance that I just provided I would like to make a few key points.","Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2% we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures and the impact of Hepatitis C products, our operational sales growth at the midpoint of our guidance is approximately 6% for the full year 2015 as compared to 5% for all of 2014.","We expect that the higher level of other income in our guidance for 2015 will mitigate the lower level of income from OLYSIO into 2015 as compared to 2014, and allow for continued investment in the business particularly in research and development as we continue to build our pipeline and now with the inclusion of the gain from the Cordis divestiture we are able to offset some currency headwinds to earnings as well. With regard to earnings on the constant currency basis our guidance on an operational EPS growth is strong and in the range between 4% and 6%.","In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results for the first quarter of the year and we're pleased with what we see for the full year namely strong underlying sales growth, solid operational earnings per share and the benefits of the decisive portfolio actions enabling us to fund investments in future growth opportunities and also help us mitigate some of the currency headwinds.","Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. And Andrea, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Mike.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning. Thanks guys taking my questions. So Dominic, the first question you'll probably going to have is the FX headwind obviously has gotten worse over the course of the last few months, and you reflected that in the guidance. You're helping manage through 2015 with the gains from NUCYNTA and Cordis, but that won't help you for 2016. So we're a long ways away from there, but obviously the question is, can you grow earnings in 2016 after the gains you'll be taking in 2015, assuming the dollar holds at least?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Mike, it\u2019s a good question and let assume the dollar holds and there isn't further currency headwinds. Yes, we did purposely offset some of the OLYSIO income we saw in 2014 with now this benefit from the divestitures that we talked about and are very transparent about in 2015.","I would say, with a business of our size $70 billion to $75 billion in sales, we actively manage our portfolio and we would expect that we would continue to do so and as we talked about before, look at the businesses that we expect to not be in and make the right portfolio choices and take the size of actions and that will further enable us to refocus our resources in the right areas. So I think, although I can't predict the level of other income we would have in 2016, I wouldn't expect the drop off so dramatically.","And secondly, as I mentioned our sales growth is accelerating, our business has been managed well by all of our business leaders around the world. So I'd expect continued sales growth and increase profitability from those sales as we move forward. So, more to come and we'll obviously keep you posted throughout the year.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Let me ask two kind of balance sheet, capital allocation questions and one, you and I discussed this a few weeks ago in our call, but I know lot of you like questions on the back of the press reports on Pharmacyclics and Abbey's acquisition there and JNJ's potential involvement. So I won't ask you to comment on JNJ's involvement, but can you talk about the companies thinking about larger M&A particularly in the pharmaceutical space, but really across portfolio, the appetite for larger M&A at this point.","And then, second, I'd be interested just in your comment on the back the GE activity on Friday. As you're aware, GE is part of its move to slim down to being more of a pure industrial company to offset some of that dilution announced that they were going to repatriate $36 billion in cash that was sitting outside the U.S. to fund the stock buyback, that doesn't help your discussions with the Washington about getting the holiday or more meaningful change in tax laws to allow you guys to access that cash. So, with GE being this very high profile and U.S. multinational repatriating all this cash, does it change your thinking at all about how you're managing your cash balance all of which sits outside the U.S? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Mike. There's a lot there. So let me start with the first half which was about, I think the appetite for large acquisitions and I won't comment on rumours or speculation about our involvement in the Pharmacyclics. I think just to take a step back our capital allocation policy remains the same and we have for a long time emphasize dividends as the first use of our capital and we believe that's the most enduring return to shareholders and we've demonstrated over now 52 consecutive years of increase in dividend. And then, it was up to me and others in our business, we'd invest all of the remaining free cash flow and value creating acquisitions whether they were large or small.","I think the key point here is the transaction value creating regardless of its size, so our appetite doesn't really change in terms of whether or not an acquisition is large or small our view of acquisition is being value creating has to do with the disciplined approach we take to evaluate an acquisition and whether its large or small we're not going to overpay for an asset. Typically, large acquisitions are difficult to generate value from because either over valued by the market or significant premiums required or the asset is already substantially mature enough where you can add much to it.","But I would not necessarily read into any of our discussions or actions as being necessarily adverse or favorable towards any size particular size or transaction. And it's true that over the long period of time the majority of our transactions have been below $1 billion actually, but we've done as you know with the transaction and important strategic moves that are significant on the $20 billion range. So hopefully that provides you some insight there.","On the repatriation question, we're still firm believers that the ultimate conclusion here is a much more competitive corporate tax system in the U.S. I can't speak for what GE did but this not alter our view that its currently uneconomical to repatriate those earnings at such a high corporate tax burden and we'd much rather see our government move in the direction of lowering that tax burden for corporation, getting that cash back to the U.S and invested more appropriate without the burden of this extra tax spike, but I can't comment on why or whether we would do something similar as to what GE did.","Mike Weinstein","Thanks, Dominic. It\u2019s very helpful.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Yes. Thanks so much for taking the questions, just a couple on the pharma side here. One you mentioned as we run guidance and how you're thinking about 2015 with PROCRIT and other products. Just any thoughts by biosimilar REMICADE in the U.S. and is that anyway factored into your thinking for the rest of this year?","And then, on the oncology side, one area we hear a lot of focus on for lot of companies is immuno-oncology and I just wondering if you share any thoughts, I know you have your pharma business everyday [ph] coming up little bit here, but any thoughts you can share with that as you kind of ready for these big oncology meeting, you're focus on getting more involved on the immuno-oncology side? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Vamil, well, our guidance for 2015 does not assume any biosimilar competition in the U.S. We remained confident in the strength of our patents and obviously we're pursuing all available avenues to protect our intellectual property, but we're not expecting biosimilar competition 2015 in the guidance that I provided.","In terms of oncology and immuno-oncology in particular our teams have done very, very good work here in the next generation of immuno-oncology and I think it\u2019s a best to save any further comment to the experts and you'll hear from them and see them in action on May 20. And I encourage you all to hear what they have to say, I think you'll find it very exciting.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry?","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope you can hear me okay, I'm on the cell phone.","Louise Mehrotra","Yes, we can, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen","Great. Let me start off with first, it was good to see the acceleration in the consumer segment, I thinking it was about 4.7% organic growth. Dominic, can you talk about how sustainable that is?","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Larry. Well, thanks for pointing it out. We're very pleased with the consumer businesses progress over the last several years actually and now we're seeing that progress result in higher sales levels, for couple of reasons. I think overall the market is healthier in consumer spending is what we see. We also have made important innovations in that consumer healthcare particular in skincare and we see skincare doing really well and we continue to invest behind it.","And then finally we made great progress in the OTC business in terms of resolving and remediating the issues around the consent decree. We're complete with all of those particular actions, although we still need to wait for final FDA certification, but now that allows us to more freely ship product from those plans. We can do so on a consistent basis. We're happy to see that was those products hit the shelves they go quickly, we're happy to see that we're able to replenish the shelves in a more consistent basis. So, we believe consumers are off to a great start in 2015 and we're expecting more continued positive results from the business going forward.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks, Dominic. On the Q4 call you said you'd expected consumer and devices to both accelerate in 2015. And as you noted we saw consumer accelerated in the first quarter, but we didn't see devices accelerate. So, do you still expect devices to accelerate in 2015 and if so what drives that? Thanks for taking the questions.","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Thanks, Larry. Thanks for the question. Well, let's take a minute to just put the medical device results for the quarter in perspective, of course, negatively impacted by the divestitures and as we said about 1.3% growth without that. But underlying that there's a few issues there that I think is important to point out. One is we existed the women's health business recently. We also have seen these, the negative impact of the price reset in the Vision Care business, so that's a drag quite frankly year-over-year, and also the continue headwinds that we faced in our diabetes business as to pricing.","When you exclude those factors and you sort of normalize, but what's really happening in the underlying business, it's growing at approximate 3% or about equal to the market. Now, going forward the medical device business as we describe last year in the medical device day has a number of new product launches 30 new product that we're expecting the launch by 2016, some of them have already began the launch. So, we're very optimistic about the fact that the medical device business will return to grow especially ones we lap some of these comparisons and also we see the benefits of the new products that we're launching. So we're very excited about the future.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Louise Mehrotra","You're welcome. Next question please.","Operator","Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning Jami.","Jami Rubin","Good morning. Couple of questions for you Dominic, just back on the REMICADE biosimilar potential, can you just update us on what's happening with the patent, because the last we saw the U.S. PTO issued a rejection on your September 2018 composition of matter patent and just if you could remind us what the appeals process looks like, could Celltrion launch at risk since you lost the patent, the composition of matter. How does that work?","And then, one probably, do you have long-dated patents around REMICADE that you can assert using the 351(k) pathway. And then my second question relates to utilization. I think in the last quarter or two you talk about two straight quarters of improved U.S. utilization. Are you seeing that continue into the first quarter?","And then last question, and apologies for the nitpickiness of this, but I'm just trying to understand my math. You had talked about an additional $500 million in one-time gains from sales. That to me looks like $0.14 but you talked about $0.10 combined with -- which was a combination of the one-time gain plus operational benefits, so, just curious what I'm missing. Thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","Okay, okay Jami. Thanks for the questions. So let me start with\u2026","Jami Rubin","I'm sorry, they are too many but I had to get them all-in.","Dominic Caruso","That's okay. You got them all in. I'll try my best to answer them all. And we'll take them in the same order. So the REMICADE Biosimilar patent situation is what you asked about. So let me just give a perspective on that. Yes, it's true that the U.S. Patent Office has issued what is referred to as a final rejection. But under the process in the U.S. Patent Office, the word final is not exactly what Layman or I would consider as final. So there are number of steps that can still occur after that final rejection and in fact one of those steps includes our response to that final rejection which we filed just yesterday.","Then that filing then is reviewed by the Patent Office and we would expect to hear back from them in the next 30 to 60 days and depending on that response we then have another avenue of appeal which if the current position of the Patent Offices remains the same we have another appeal process which could take another 12 months or so to prosecute with the Patent Office and then after that even if there is an adverse ruling after that there's another decision to the Court of Appeals in the federal circuit court that we could appeal for which would take another 12 to 18 months.","So first of all, as I said earlier, we're very confident in the strength of our patents and we intent to pursue all the available avenues for appeal and we're doing so including our response just yesterday to what was previously described by you as the final. But it's not final as I've just described.","On whether Celltrion will launch at risk it\u2019s a question for them. I really can't comment what they might do. And then in terms of utilization we have seen an uptake in utilization in this first quarter, a continued trend, although slight increases but nonetheless positive increases in overall hospital admissions, surgical procedures, doctor visits, et cetera, so that's encouraging. We continue to see now trends of now three consecutive quarters of positive trends in healthcare utilization.","And then finally, on your math, as you were trying to do and let me try to help everyone that, because I think it would be a common question. So we talked about increase in other income and expense, because of the tax rates applied to those particular items in that line item, let's call that roughly about $0.12 of earnings and minus \u2013 sorry, let's call that $0.12 on earnings on a pretax basis, the tax rate going up is primarily due to the fact that those items have a higher U.S. tax burden, so our tax rate went up as a results let's call that $0.07 negative. So now you're up $0.05. And we said, we increased our operational earnings by $0.10, so that $0.05 I just described and another $0.05 just as a continued good management and overall progress we're making in the business overall for the $0.10 that I've just described earlier, so hopefully that's helpful.","Jami Rubin","Yes. Thank you very much.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning, guys. Wanted to start with a question on spine, Louise, in your prepared remarks you talked about, I believe it was in the U.S., competition and pricing challenge for the negative U.S. spine number in the quarter. Can you talk to us about what the challenges you're facing? Is it from the smaller players taking share? And can you describe to us the pricing pressure, and how that compared to the fourth quarter? And then I had a follow-up on robotics.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. So going forward because we have some movement between price and mix when a new products goes up, annualizes itself, I'm going to start giving people only price and mix on the U.S. price changes, okay. So, in the first quarter we had a 5% decline price and mix in the U.S. in spine and that compared to about 4% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","And regarding the competitive there is new products coming out with our competition and as Dominic mentioned we have a number of new products coming from ourselves as well. So it's just more of timing and we expect it to pickup throughout the year.","Glenn Novarro","And just as a follow-up, the pricing little worse for you guys here in the first quarter, do you have any commentary why that may have happened, does it just more about your mix and your new product cadence?","Louise Mehrotra","Its lot to do with the mix, Glenn, yes.","Dominic Caruso","I think generally Glenn, price has been negative in this marketplace in orthopedics now for several quarters and we're just seeing that trend continue. We just saw it recently as well.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, and just on the competition side, like I said. You can look at two-thirds of the market, and it's you and Medtronic. So is the pressure really coming from that other third, some of the younger upstart companies?","Louise Mehrotra","I'm just going to take a look at the share data and then I will \u2013 if you have another question, go ahead and ask that and I'll just take a look at the share and see where it's going then.","Glenn Novarro","And then, I just wanted to follow-up on your robotics commentary. So, you recently announced collaboration with Google. Can you talk about the timing of when you may have a robot that could enter the market? Is this two or three years out, longer or shorter? Any commentary on the time frame would be helpful?","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Sure, Glenn. Well, so one thing I would say, this is a continuation of what we discussed at the MD&D business review day a year ago. So we had mentioned that we were working on our own robotics program internally. We've now obviously partnered with Google to gain their expertise in technology and visualization and in robotics and I think that's going to provide us some acceleration to the plans we were already anticipating.","We're already in the market for robotics in terms of our particular \u2013 in terms of particular procedures where our Ethicon products are used at the end of the robot, at the actually procedure end of the robot. So we'll continue to do that. We would expect this collaboration would take \u2013 I would say several years for us to come to the market with the new type of robotic surgery that we think we'll dramatically revolutionize surgery. So, I think it will take some time to do that, but we're accelerating our efforts there and I'd say it\u2019s a couple of years away.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Glenn, I just checked, it is the smaller players that appeared to be taking share.","Glenn Novarro","Okay.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Glenn Novarro","Thanks, Dominic.","Dominic Caruso","You're welcome.","Operator","You're next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, David.","David Lewis","Hi, good morning. Just Dominic, one quick nit for you, and then a couple pharmaceutical questions as well, just as we see a step up in gross margins, Dominic, in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, we didn't see that in this particular quarter. Was anything driving that in particular?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, David, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the main issue with gross margin this quarter versus last year and also versus the fourth quarter I should have said, that has to do with currency impact. So it's just \u2013 even though we hedge most of our manufacturing foreign currency commitments; they do roll over from year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter so this particular quarter I could sort of reflect on it and say it\u2019s essentially all currency impacts.","David Lewis","Okay. It\u2019s very helpful and then two quick questions on pharma. The first is on REMICADE outside the U.S. there was a little bit of softness. It wasn\u2019t clear from prepared remarks whether that reflected inventory issues or some stocking element or increasing competition. And then secondarily and INVOKANA a very strong number the two elements I wanted to get your views on. The first is, it does appear in some of the data INVOKANA is beginning to accelerate its year related to certain specific competitors.","And the second question was just given these increasing concerns on DPV IV [ph] drug class, could we see a positive class effect? Are you expecting one for the SGL2s? Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Yes well with REMICADE OUS as Louise mentioned we saw these are shipments that we make to our partner Merck for their territories outside the U.S. and as you know many of those territories we have seen the loss of exclusivity so biosimilars have entered those markets. So the primary reason is basically lower shipments to our partner as they plan for the balance of the year, anything else you could add to that Louise.","Louise Mehrotra","Yeah so if you will recall about a year ago we made some changes to our supply chain which caused the some of the export sales that we recorded in the U.S. we actually recorded in the international. So you really have to add those two together to get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on there. If you take a look at them together it\u2019s down about 2%.","We had very strong sales in Canada and then that was offset by some the distributor sales being down due to the weakening of the euro and also market pressures because of the biosimilars and they did have an inventory build with our distributors. So there\u2019s a number of compounding factors that are going on there. So you really need to take a look at it in total.","Dominic Caruso","And then with INVOKANA we are very pleased obviously with the performance of INVOKANA and with INVOKAMET in particular because as you know you know many patients take these SGLT2s in combination with Metformin so that product is doing well.","Whether or not this is a class effect for SGLT2 I think we have a particular benefit and strong SGLT2 and the benefit that we have here is of course the lower HbA1c levels, lower weight gain etcetera so the product is getting very very good acceptance and it\u2019s now you know exceeding all the other SGLT2 that have recently come to the market by significant margins and gaining market share despite increased competition.","Louise Mehrotra","And so our commercial payers we have about 75% coverage at Tier 2 and the Part D we have about 85% coverage added here to which is the lowest tier for our brand. And so we are doing very very well in the reimbursement front and we are gaining share in all the categories. You know the end work share sequentially, it\u2019s a 11.8 in the first quarter and that\u2019s up from 10.3, so nice growth there and even more impressive is the primary care going from 3.6 to 4.3 and primary care is about 60% of that market, so it\u2019s really impressive results.","David Lewis","Great. Thank you very much.","Louise Mehrotra","You\u2019re welcome. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Rick.","Rick Wise","Good morning, Dominic and Louise how are you doing? Let me start off Dominic with surgical care and speciality surgeries specifically you know both business has been pretty flat for a few quarter here. It\u2019s not surprising in median surgical care but speciality surgery, can you \u2013 you were saying volumes are picking up and that we have not seen it yet. Is this lagging or it\u2019s been accelerated competitive issues, just give us some more color if you could. Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","So within the speciality surgery area we have a number of businesses put in there. So if you but you could take a look at the core businesses of biologics and energy, biologics is up 7% worldwide, energy is up 4% worldwide and if you look at the OUS for biologics its up 11% and OUS is up 5%. So a clearance in there which is causing some depression of the numbers, Mentor is in there as well what Mentor is doing well. So but if you really take a look at the two cores, they are doing very well.","Dominic Caruso","Yeah, I think that\u2019s well said Louise. Biosurgicals in particular is doing very very well and Energy is with the launch of new products is gaining momentum. I think we\u2019ll see it in future quarters quite frankly as these products have just recently launched, but there is some noise in the other segments, but the overall core business is doing very well Rick.","Rick Wise","Okay. And turning to diabetes you highlighted that ANIMAS have strong double digit growth is this all VIBE and moving past the negative price cuts and just and may be talk \u2013 give a little more color again on VIBE the roll out where you are and you have highlighted the 3-Day Wearable Patch as a possibility, where does that stand? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well Rick it is primarily due to the VIBE business. So VIBE was launched OUS last year and continue to pick up a lot of volume, did extremely well OUS and was just launched in the U.S. recently and we\u2019re seeing some very very good uptick on VIBE and we\u2019re very very pleased by that new insulin pump it\u2019s doing very very well taking share and growing and with the with what we saw happening OUS certainly bodes well for the uptick of that product in the U.S.","In terms of the Wearable Patch Pump that\u2019s probably a couple of years out still, obviously we need to scale up manufacturing complete some additional work on that. A few of us were just there recently visiting our diabetes business and all plans are in shape there, they are moving forward with all the manufacturing that needs to be done, so we are very excited that will come in the market but it\u2019s probably you know by \u2013 but not before 2016 I would say.","Rick Wise","Okay, just a quick follow up on the VIBE. Are you getting to taking you are sure are you converting your existing customers or is it taking competitive share?","Dominic Caruso","Yes from what we saw the data we saw shows us that we are taking competitive share you know from the major player in the marketplace.","Louise Mehrotra","Yes with the very strong growth rates we had we would have to be taking share. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Jenning with Cowen & Company.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Jenning","Good morning, thanks so much for taking the question. Just wanted to start Dominic if you would just on the strategy behind the quarters divestiture it seemed like it was an underperforming unit, but just you know throughout last year some of your commentary now it\u2019s a commentary seem that you were looking to get bigger in cardiology not smaller. Can you give us just a little more color on that acquisition and also just your outlook for the cardiology spaces and your comfort level of having a relatively standalone BioSense Webster division?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, well it\u2019s a great question, Josh. We\u2019ve been very consistent with our approach to divestitures and Alex has many times if we are not neither number one or number two in the market or we don\u2019t see a pathway of being number one, number two in the markets through technology and the appropriate amount of investment or for example if its not otherwise complementary to our business and it should be a candidate for divestiture.","So as you pointed out we obviously did not divest the BioSense Webster piece of the Cordis business, that\u2019s very very promising. Business is doing extremely well; new innovations come in the market etcetera. So we are pleased with being in the cardiovascular device space where innovation is rewarded and whether significant unmet need that we can actually address the main reason for exiting the Cordis business is it generally has become from our vantage point the commodity business and it will be in our view better managed in the hands of others and I think Cardinal is going to do just a great job with that business.","Josh Jenning","Thanks for that and then just the follow up on operating margins in the quarter. You know only 50 basis point ahead year-over-year despite release your headwind and affects. Can you help us think about sort of apples-to-apples ex-HCV [ph] in terms of the operating margin performance and then how we should think about operating margins year-over-year 2015 over 2014? Thanks a lot.","Dominic Caruso","Yes well the first quarter there was some impact for OLYSIO but obviously OLYSIO grew throughout 2014 so we\u2019ll see that operating margin decline more pronounced in future quarters obviously and that\u2019s all in our guidance. The guidance we provided shows that if I mean we didn\u2019t give you a specific operating margin but you walk through the P&L as you update your models you\u2019ll see that the pre tax operating profit margin is probably going to go down about 150 basis points and that\u2019s primarily 120 basis points due to the OLYSIO net OLYSIO because remember we invested some of those gains last year. And that of course is what I referred to earlier that were offsetting with the decisions that we\u2019ve made about the portfolio we think these are the right decisions to make at the right time, they also come at a time when we can offset this decline in operating profit margin. Hopefully that\u2019s clear now Josh.","Josh Jenning","Thanks so much.","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","And we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Jason.","Jayson Bedford","Good morning, thanks for taking the questions, just a couple of quick ones. On consumer, in terms of the consent decree, third party has blessed the facilities. You're now waiting for the FDA. When it's officially lifted, can you give us an idea as to the potential impact on the business if any and specifically as it relates to margins which still look like the down in the low double digit?","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Jason well it is true that we\u2019ve completed our work and we have outside party that sort of verifies what we completed and prepares their report and then the FDA has to come in and certify. But even after the FDA certifies remember that we still will operate under the consent decree for a 5-year period, that\u2019s what the law requires.","Now during that 5-year period we\u2019ll continue to make improvements etcetera but and I would say generally speaking the consumer business has done a very nice job mapping out the fact that gross margins and overall margins in that business should improve overtime while at the same time we\u2019re investing behind the products that we are launching. So I would say we\u2019ll see continued improvements in margins, I wouldn\u2019t view them as dramatic in the short term but continued steady progress and improvements in that business which we are very pleased with.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you very much. So some final comments from Dominic.","Dominic Caruso","Okay, thanks everyone, and thanks, Louise. So as I noted earlier we are very pleased with our strong start to 2015 and I would just like to take a moment and recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson and thank you all for your time this morning. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.","And finally just a reminder, that we will be conducting a review for the investment community of our pharmaceutical business on May 20th in New Brunswick and I obviously look forward to seeing you all there. So have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question and answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2013. Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details.","This review is being made available to a broader audience via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations\u2019 section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the first quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the financial results and guidance for 2013. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 1 hour.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your model. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release.","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations\u2019 section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled, supplementary sales data by geographic area. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2013, up 8.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. On an operational basis sales were up 9.8% and currency had a negative impact of 1.3%. The acquisition of Synthes was completed in the second quarter of 2012. In the current quarter the acquisition, net of the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business, contributed 5.7% to the worldwide operational sales growth.","In the U.S., sales were up 11.2%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 8.7% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.4 points. The Asia Pacific\/Africa region grew 11.8% operationally while the western hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 9.1% operationally. Europe grew 6.2% on an operational basis. The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made strong contributions to the results in all regions.","If you\u2019ll now turn to the consolidated statements of earnings. Net earnings were $3.5 billion compared to $3.9 billion in the same period in 2012. Earnings per share were $1.22 versus $1.41 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section with the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items.","As referenced in the accompanying table of non-GAAP measures 2013 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude special items primarily related to an increase in the litigation accrual as well as integration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. First quarter 2012 net earnings included a gain related to an after-tax special item of $106 million as outlined in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.1 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.44, representing increases of 8.0% and 5.1%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2012.","I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the component leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. For the first quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 31.7% was up 130 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to an inventory step up charge related to the Synthes acquisition. Excluding the inventory step up charge which has been treated as a special item, cost of goods sold increased 50 basis points versus the same period last year.","Incremental amortization expense related to Synthes of approximately $140 million negatively impacted cost of goods sold by 80 basis points. Also impacting cost of goods sold were the ongoing remediation work in our OTC business and the medical devices excise tax. Positive mix and cost reduction efforts partially offset these items.","First quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses at 29.8% of sales were down 130 basis points due to tightening up expenditures as well as cost containment initiatives across many of our businesses.","Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.2%, consistent with our 2012 results.","Interest expense net of interest income of $104 million was down $26 million versus the first quarter of 2012 due to a lower average debt level. Other expense net of other income was $515 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $611 million of other income net of other expense in the same period last year. excluding special items, other income net of other expense of $83 million was $411 million less than 2012 due primarily to lower gains from divestitures. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate of 19% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 22.8% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide commentary on taxes in his remarks.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the first quarter of 2013. I\u2019ll begin with the consumer segment.","Worldwide Consumer segments sales for the first quarter of 2013 of $3.7 billion increased 2.2% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 3.3% while the impact of currency was negative 1.1%.  U.S sales were up 2.4%, while international sales grew 3.8% on an operational basis.","Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, operational growth was approximately 4.3%. Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 7% when compared to the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to wipes, hair care, cleansers and powders.","Sales in the oral care business increased 5.1% operationally. Results were driven by strong sales of LISTERINE due to the continued success of new product launches partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the manual toothbrushes in the U.S.","For the first quarter of 2013, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 7.6% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2012, with U.S sales up 14.4% and sales outside the U.S up 3.9% on an operational basis. The strong sales results in the U.S were driven by analgesics and upper respiratory products due to progress in returning to a reliable supply of products to the marketplace and a strong flu season.","Strong growth of analgesics drove results outside the U.S. Our skin care business was flat on an operational basis in the first quarter of 2013. Strong results for NEUTROGENA were offset by the impact of divestiture, the initial stocking related to new product launches last year and competitive pressure. Women's health grew 0.8% on an operational basis due to strong growth in liners offset by lower sales of KY products.","Wound Care\/Other sales decreased 10% on an operational basis with the sales decline in the U.S. of 13.3% and outside the U.S. operational sales were down 6.1% due to competitive pressures and the impact of divestiture. That completes our review of the consumer segment and I will now review highlights for our pharmaceutical segment.","Worldwide net sales for the first quarter of $6.8 billion increased 10.4% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 11.4% with the negative currency impact of 1 point. Sales in the U.S. increased 14.7% while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 8.1%. U.S. results included a positive adjustment to previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates under the Affordable Care Act related to new data received from the states. Excluding this item, both U.S. sales and worldwide sales were up approximately 8% operationally. The most significant impacts from the adjustment were in immunology, neuroscience and PROCRIT.","Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas. Immunology products grew 16.8% operationally with sales in the U.S. up 12.8%. Excluding the adjustment, U.S. immunology growth was approximately 6.5% with REMICADE excluding export sales, up approximately 4%. SIMPONI up approximately 22%, and STELARA up approximately 57%. Results were driven by strong market growth across the major products, complemented by increased market share for STELARA. With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology.","REMICADE exports sales declined 7.7% due primarily to a change in inventory levels. Immunology sales outside the U.S. increased by 30.1% operationally due to strong results for both SIMPONI and STELARA. SIMPONI's strong growth was due to the increased shipments to our distribution partner and very strong growth in Japan. STELARA made significant contributions due primarily to market share gains complemented by strong market growth in the major regions. Sales of infectious disease products increased 8.6% on an operational basis. INCIVO, a treatment for hepatitis C, grew 24.9% on an operational basis due to the success of the continued rollout primarily in Latin America.","Please note for your models, 2012 sales by quarter for both INCIVO and XARELTO have been included in the sales by major product schedule. Continued momentum in market share growth of PREZISTA made notable contributions to the results as to the combined sales of COMPLERA and EDURANT. Neuroscience product sales increased 7.7% on an operational basis with U.S. growth at 10.7%. Excluding the managed Medicaid adjustment which is primarily related to TOPAMAX and CONCERTA, U.S. sales declined approximately 2% impacted by generic competition primarily for CONCERTA and DURAGESIC.","The long-acting injectable antipsychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or Xeplion achieved operational growth of nearly 20% due to an increase in combined market share. INVEGA achieved double-digit operational growth of 11.1% due to strong operational growth outside the U.S. primarily driven by increased market share in Japan.","Sales of oncology products increased 35% on an operational basis due to the very strong results for ZYTIGA. ZYTIGA is now approved to treat both chemo-refractory and chemo na\u00efve metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 70%, with U.S. sales growing 61% due to a very strong market growth of over 20% and increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer market. ZYTIGA has captured 28% of that market and is up 1.5 points sequentially. Operational sales outside the U.S. grew 83.4% versus first quarter 2012 and on a sequential basis were up over 20%. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 75 countries. VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 2.5% on an operational basis.","As I mentioned last quarter, the timing of tender business negatively impacted the growth rate in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the timing of the tender business, operational growth was over 20%. Strong performance in patient share in the frontline setting and the launch of the subcutaneous version continues to drive sales growth.","Other oncology increased primarily due to Doxil\/Caelyx. Regarding Doxil in the U.S, Johnson is releasing additional Doxil produced by an alternate manufacturing approach under the regulatory discretion of the U.S FDA. The longer term solution for Doxil\/Caelyx production involving transitioning manufacturing to additional suppliers continues to meet expected milestones.","Other pharmaceutical products declined 1.7% on an operational basis with lower sales for Eprex and Pariet related primarily to generic competition. PROCRIT results were impacted by the managed Medicaid adjustment. Excluding this item, PROCRIT sales declined approximately 14% due primarily to a market decline. Positively impacting results, Xarelto sales grew over 60% on a sequential basis, capturing 38% of the new to brand scripts in cardiology.","Total prescription share in the broader anticoagulant market grew 1.6 points on a sequential basis to 5.6%. as an update on the status of the acute coronary syndrome indication for XARELTO, the FDA issued a second complete response letter. Johnson is continuing to work with the FDA to address their questions.","That completes a review of the pharmaceutical segment. I\u2019ll now review the medical devices and diagnostic segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $7.1 billion grew 11.9% operationally as compared to the same period in 2012. Currency had a negative impact of 1.7%, resulting in a total sales increase of 10.2%. Sales excluding the net impact of Synthes were down 2.4% on an operational sales, with U.S sales down 5.2% and sales outside the U.S down 0.2% on an operational basis.  ","Divestitures and exit from certain businesses drove approximately half the worldwide operational decline in the quarter. Market dynamics, including lower distributor inventories, pricing pressures, as well as the impact of less selling days, particularly in our orthopedics business, negatively impacted operational growth by approximately 2 points. I will provide more commentary on these factors in the franchise reviews.","Now turning to the MD&D business, starting with cardiovascular care. Cardiovascular care sales were up 8.5% operationally, with U.S. up 12.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 6.2% operationally. Excluding the impact of drug eluting stents, worldwide sales were up nearly 11% on an operational basis due to strong results for Biosense Webster's and endovascular products.","Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business achieved worldwide operational sales growth of nearly 12% in the quarter, driven by market share growth. The expansion of the install base of the CARTO 3 system and the success of catheter launches made strong contributions to the results. Strong double digit growth for endovascular products were driven by the re-launch of the S.M.A.R.T. vascular stent system and the EXOSEAL Vascular Closure Device.","The diabetes care business operational sales declined 9.8% in the first quarter of 2013, with U.S business down 19.6% due to the impact of the initial stocking related to new product launches last year, lower price and competitive pressures, including private label. The business outside the U.S. grew 0.9% operationally, with strong sales in emerging markets largely offset by lower sales in many of the developed markets.","The diagnostics business declined 4.9% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of RhoGAM and the varicose business, operational sales grew approximately 2%, with U.S. growth of approximately 8% and growth outside the U.S. down approximately 3% operationally. Results in the U.S were driven by strong growth in clinical labs and donor screening.","Infection prevention declined 10.5% on an operational basis, with sales in the U.S. down 26.7%. Last year in the U.S., a customer program to upgrade systems to STERRAD solutions ended in the first quarter, impacting the timing of capital purchases for the balance of the year in 2012. Excluding capital sales, U.S. results declined approximately 3.5% in the quarter due primarily to timing of purchases for consumables.","Outside the U.S., operational growth of 4.1% was driven by both consumables and capital items sales. Orthopedic sales were up 60.7% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2012. Excluding the net impact of Synthes and the divestiture of certain neurosurgical instruments, operational sales were flat with the U.S. flat and outside the U.S. down approximately 1% operationally. Worldwide sales were impacted by approximately 1.5 less selling days in the quarter.","Operationally, hips were 2% worldwide driven by 5% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were flat on an operational basis with strong results in emerging markets offset by slower sales in the developed markets. Knees worldwide declined 1% on an operational basis, with U.S. up 1% driven by fixed bearing and revision platforms offset by lower sales of rotating platforms. Sales outside the U.S. were down 2% with lower sales of low contact stress or LCS and mobile bearing technology.","Including the Synthes business in both periods, and excluding the divested DePuy trauma business in both periods, trauma grew approximately 2% on an operational basis with similar results both in and outside the U.S. The fourth quarter supply disruption in the U.S. was substantially remedied late in the first quarter. Including the Synthes business in both periods, worldwide spine was down 7% on an operational basis with the U.S. down approximately 10% impacted by the continued softness as well as the restructuring of the commercial sales organization. Outside the U.S. sales were down approximately 3% operationally.","Specialty surgery operational growth was 1% in the first quarter of 2013. U.S. sales were down 2.4% and sales outside the U.S. were up 4.7% on an operational basis. Strong sales of energy products outside the U.S. and solid results for bio-surgical products were substantially offset by lower sales of mental products due to market and pricing pressure. Surgical care worldwide sales were down 5.4% on an operational basis with the U.S. 10.5% and sales outside the U.S. down 2.4% operationally. Negatively impacting growth were divestitures and business exits as well as other factors such as reduction in inventory levels.","Excluding these items, the underlying business was down approximately 1.5 points. Competitive and pricing dynamics impacted sales in the quarter. Rounding up the review of the medical devices and diagnostics segment, our vision care business achieved operational sales growth of 1.6% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year with the similar results both in and outside the U.S. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses, partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses. That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2013.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Louise, and good morning everyone. I would like to start by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with the families and victims of the tragic event in Boston yesterday. Now turning to the business of this call. I would like to provide some additional comments about our first quarter results, highlight some of our recent business and pipeline developments, and then provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2013.","I am pleased that we are off to a good start in 2013 with solid results in the first quarter. We continued delivering on our three near term priorities, building on the momentum in our pharmaceuticals business, integrating Synthes and returning a reliable supply of OTC products for the marketplace. I would like to make a few comments on the state of the healthcare market.","While we believe that overall healthcare utilization trends continues to show signs of stabilization, the modest positive increases we saw in the fourth quarter do not appear to have persisted. And at this point we are not anticipating a meaningful market acceleration this year. Adapting to these changes in the healthcare environment is important and our leaders continue to apply financial discipline for operations while investing in key growth opportunities.","Our growth strategies of creating value for innovation, global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with a purpose, are begin executed well across our businesses as you will see in the review of our highlights for the first quarter. The breadth of our business which provides balance and consistency to our overall performance, as well as the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our people in all of our locations around the world, positions us well to sustain and drive growth in this increasingly dynamic global healthcare market.","Let\u2019s review some highlights for the Q1 results. We had a solid start to the year and are pleased to report earnings per share of %1.44 excluding special items. This result was driven by operational sales growth from the first quarter of 9.8% versus the prior year, which was led by the success of many of our recently launched pharmaceutical products as well as the addition of Synthes to our orthopedics business.","As we announced in February, our first quarter earnings were impacted by the Venezuelan government\u2019s decision to devalue its currency, for which we incurred a charge of approximately $100 million net income and which resulted in a $0.04 negative impact to earnings per share. This charge is related to the re-measurement of our local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation. We did not treat this charge as a special item and I\u2019m pleased that this negative impact to earnings was more than offset by strong operating performance in the first quarter.","As you know, the federal R&D tax credit was renewed by congress in January under the American Taxpayer Relief Act for both 2012 and 2013 and during the first quarter, we recorded the full year impact of the 2012 effect. We recorded special items in the first quarter of approximately $600 million on an after tax basis that consisted of charges primarily for litigation expense accruals related to various legal matters and as expected, continued costs associated with the global integration of Synthes.","Along with the charge for in process research and development, these special items negatively impacted our first quarter results by $0.23 per share. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 for the quarter exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates of $1.40 as published by First Call.","Let\u2019s look at sales performance by segment. In pharmaceuticals we reported operational sales growth in the quarter of approximately 11.4% fueled by the continued strong performance of long established brands, including REMICADE, PREZISTA, STELARA and INVEGA SUSTENNA and more recently launched products such as ZYTIGA and XARELTO which are continuing to grow share even with new competitors entering their markets, largely due to the strength of the clinical profiles of these medicines themselves and the strong commercialization capabilities in our pharmaceuticals business.","In MD&D, sales increased 11.9% operationally versus the prior year. this included the impact of Synthes net of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business, which contributed 14% growth. In addition to Synthes, Biosense Webster's electrophysiology devices and Cordis' endovascular products in our Cardiovascular Care business, coupled with Vision Care's ACUVUE TRUEYE and 1-Day ACUVUE MOIST disposable contact lenses also contributed to our growth.","Strategic divestitures and exits from certain businesses have impacted the growth in our MD&D segment this quarter, as did key market dynamics such as the initial implementation of the Medicare competitive bidding legislation in diabetes, significant decreases in the women\u2019s health market and reductions in U.S distributor inventory levels, as well as less selling days, particularly in orthopedics as Louise mentioned.","In our consumer business, of particular note this quarter is the growth in our over the counter medicines businesses, as we continued to make progress in returning a reliable supply of high quality products to consumers. In the quarter we saw operational sales increase of 3.3% driven by the positive contribution of TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics, upper respiratory over-the-counter medications, baby care products, LISTERINE mouthwash and our NEUTROGENA skin care products. Divestitures impacted the growth in this segment by 1%.","I\u2019d like to provide an update on exciting developments in our pipeline of new products and I\u2019ll start with developments in our pharmaceuticals business. We were extremely pleased to have received FDA approval for INVOKANA, the first in a new class of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes to be available in the United States. It\u2019s also the first pharmaceutical product for Johnson & Johnson in this category and will be a core component of our comprehensive platform for the management of diabetes. As such, our diabetes care business will partner with our pharmaceuticals business to directly sell INVOKANA to healthcare professionals treating patients with diabetes.","We\u2019re also expecting a decision from the European Medicines Agency on our application for INVOKANA later this year, and in order to expand its use, in March we submitted a marketing authorization application to European Medicines Agency seeking approval for a fixed dose therapy that combines INVOKANA and immediate release metformin. You will recall that we filed an application for this combination with the FDA in December.","In the quarter, simeprevir or TMC435, was filed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in both Japan and the U.S., and an EU filing is expected in the second quarter. In addition, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the investigational oral agent ibrutinib as a monotherapy for three B-cell malignancies. We continue to anticipate filing for the mantle cell lymphoma indication by the end of the year. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review time for potential new medicines that treat serious or life threatening diseases or conditions based on preliminary clinical evidence.","Turning to our MD&D businesses, Ethicon Endo-Surgery earned 510(k) clearances from the U.S. FDA for two products in the ENSEAL G2 line, the cordless tissue sealer, a first of its kind product that includes a power generator and the ENSEAL G2 articulating tissue sealer device which makes it easier for surgeons to seal some vessels and control bleeding. Supporting our strategy to further our position in the endovascular market, Cordis completed its acquisition of Flexible Stenting Solutions, a leading developer of innovative flexible peripheral, arterial, venous, and biliary stents.","And recently, our diabetes care business submitted a premarket approval application for the FDA for the Animas Vibe insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring system. This next generation insulin pump incorporates Animas' color screen and waterproof technology and a Dexcom G4 Platinum sensor, which enables people with diabetes to make more informed decisions to help control their disease.","In our consumer business, during the quarter Johnson & Johnson China Investment completed the acquisition of Shanghai Elsker Mother & Baby Co., Ltd, a well-regarded baby care company in China, known for its position in the naturals segment. This is in line with our growth strategy of driving global growth with products intended for use in specific local markets. Our ability to continue to advance our pipeline for new products in all three of our segments, supports our confidence in the continued growth of our business.","Now let me provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2013. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $6 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $22 billion of cash and marketable securities and $16 billion of debt. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you considering modeling net interest expense between $450 million and $500 million consistent with our previous guidance.","Turing to other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items such as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and other divestiture asset sales and write-offs. This account also includes the impact of the Venezuelan government's decision to devalue its currency. This account is difficult to forecast, but we would be comfortable with your models for 2013 reflecting other income and expense as a net gain, excluding special items, ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance.","And now a word on taxes. The first quarter reflects the full year impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit and for the first quarter of 2013 the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was 19%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for the full year of 2013 at approximately 20% consistent with our previous guidance. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate during the remainder of the year. Now turning to sales and earnings.","We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between approximately 5.7% and 6.7% for the year, which is higher than our previous guidance. This would results in estimated sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.1 billion to $71.7 billion. While we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact of currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2013 or to stay where they were as of last week, as an example with the Euro at approximately $1.31, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for the year. thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 4.7% and 5.7% for the year for an expected level of reported sales of approximately between $70.4 billion and $71.1 billion which is lower than our prior guidance due exclusively to the weakening of several currency exchange rates versus the U.S dollar.","Turning to earnings, as a reminder our guidance reflects the following major assumptions. The implementation of the Medical Device Excise Tax. This has an incremental negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.05 and is recorded in cost of goods sold throughout the year. We will have a full year impact of amortization related to Synthes of approximately $550 million on a pretax basis or an incremental half year negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.06. Our estimated 2013 earnings include total amortization expense for the enterprise of approximately $1.4 billion on a pretax basis.","Considering these factors that I just noted as well as the early strength we saw in our operating results for the first quarter, we suggest you consider full year of 2013 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items of between $5.33 and $5.43 per share on an operational basis or a growth rate of between 4.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis which is higher than our previous guidance. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share if currency exchange rates for all of 2013 were to remain where they were at the end of last week, then our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be positively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share or $0.03 lower than the $0.05 positive impact we had previously estimated in our guidance due to exchange rate fluctuations.","We therefore suggest that you model our reported earnings per share, excluding special items in a range between $5.35 and $5.45 per share or a growth rate of between 5% and 7%, resulting in our reported EPS guidance being consistent with our previous reported EPS guidance, reflecting some stronger operational earnings offset by the negative impact of weaker currency exchange rates. Overall as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you should see that pretax operating profits are expected to improve at a slightly better rate than we had previously contemplated when we provided guidance back in January.","Now Louise back to you for the question-and-answer session.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. Stephanie, can you please give instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). And your first question is from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup","A couple of quick questions. First on the managed Medicaid, how far back does that accrual go and why in Q1? Because you didn\u2019t highlight it in the fourth quarter call.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Matt. Good question. The Affordable Care Act was instituted in 2010, in March of 2010 and it\u2019s only recently in the first quarter that we received sufficient information from the various states to true up the estimates we had made leading from the time that legislation was passed till now. So hopefully that answers your question.","Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup","It does. And then one more quick one for you, Dominic. On foreign exchange, it\u2019s now up to a negative 100 basis points on the topline, but it\u2019s positive $0.02 in the bottom. Usually does it work that way with you? How come it\u2019s a positive on the earnings this time?","Dominic Caruso","Well, the major swing currencies, Matt that are negatively impacting sales are primarily currencies where although there may be significant sales growth, there is lesser earnings impact. So for example the Yen has dramatically weakened. However, the amount of money we earn in that currency is different than the level of sales in that currency or as the euro, which is where most of the profitability of the company reside ex-U.S., has not been impacted as greatly as some of the currencies like Yen. So there is a different weighting factor of the currency's impact on sales as there is on earnings.","Operator","Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Dominic, could you just help us with the outlook on the diabetes blood glucose monitoring business. You know the Medicare cuts start I think in July 2013, so I assume the U.S. growth will probably get worse before it gets better. Maybe if you can just help us with some metrics to understand how to forecast that business, given what's going on there. And maybe a little bit about your strategy to address these issues and then I had one follow-up.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Larry. Great questions. I know you have all been following the recent legislation, it provides a pretty dramatic reduction in pricing for diabetes test strips. Of course that legislation pertains to the Medicare portion of the business. I think roughly the Medicare portion of the business for us is in the 20% to 25% range. So it's not obviously the entire business. And then in terms of the strategy going forward, of course you know we just -- I just described earlier that we were pleased to have filed an application for a new blood glucose monitoring system, the continuous glucose monitoring system with the Dexcom technology. So I think it's important that we continue to innovate where we have the ability to provide patients and healthcare professionals with the tools to better manage their diabetes care.","I think that will always be an important part of what we continue to do, although we will have to manage through the pricing impacts that pertain to the Medicare portion of our business and that I just noted.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","And then one more for you. You know more and more of your peers are excluding amortization from non-GAAP earnings. You mentioned  I think $1.4 billion and that by our math that potentially reduces your stock price by about $6. Do you think that impacts your valuation? Is that something that you may be willing to revisit in the future excluding it from your non-GAAP earnings? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Right. Larry, so we are certainly aware of that. I think that if it was just as easy, if it was that easy for me to just change our earnings by excluding the amortization and our stock would go up $6, I guess we would do that in a heartbeat. But we think our company is very well followed, understood, and we try to be as transparent as possible with our earnings guidance. And hopefully the data we give you provides you all enough data to model the company appropriately.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","I guess the one piece in the guidance that surprised me, Dominic, was what Matt was touching on which is the FX swing. So you had 130 basis points swing on the top line versus your initial guidance in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s only $0.03 impact to your EPS guidance for the year. That\u2019s purely just because of the differentials and profits or is that related more to either your transfer pricing or some hedges you may have there that we are just not aware of?","Dominic Caruso","Well, it's primarily related to the reasons I mentioned. You know currencies like the Yen have dramatically decreased but a currency like the euro, for example, is only off two or three pennies from our previous guidance and most of our ex-U.S. earnings are quite frankly in the euro zone. So the impact to earnings is not as pronounced as the overall basket of currency would indicate.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","I wanted to focus on some of your commentary around utilization and your medical device end markets. Obviously, I understood you were trying to signal that you don\u2019t see a pick up in some of your device end markets. And you also made comments about your kind of the competitive positioning in a couple of them. So maybe you could spend a minute more maybe on both. And I want to focus on two areas, one is general surgery and the second is orthopedic. So can you just give us more of a sense of both how you are feeling about those end markets and competitively, particularly on the general surgery side where you may be seeing some impact.","Dominic Caruso","Mike, with respect to utilization, we were trying to follow what's happening in the market place and obviously we have the good vantage point from where we stand with the broad-based business that we have, but we did not see any meaningful continuation of the upswing that we saw, although it was modest in the fourth quarter. We didn\u2019t see that persist into the first quarter and we also know that certain hospitals are already predicting lower levels of procedure volume than they had previously indicated. We just saw something this morning from HCA for example that talked about the level of procedure volume that they see which is quite frankly lower than the level they had predicted when they announced their guidance for 2013. So overall I think that the market is probably seeing some seasonality quite frankly. So if I comment on orthopedics first, we did in fact see an uptick in the orthopedics market overall and we did particularly well in the fourth quarter. We did not see that persist in the first quarter of 2013, although there is some noise there of course because then you have less selling days as Louise pointed out.","So if you neutralize for that, it\u2019s about equal in terms of the overall impact to our business first quarter versus fourth quarter. So no great acceleration, but no deceleration per se in orthopedics, just really the selling days impact is what is dramatically impacting that business. For surgery, there\u2019s a number of factors that we mentioned. For example lowering levels of inventory by distributors, some pricing impact and we did see some competitive inroads in general surgery and obviously our response to that is to continue to improve with the offering of products that we have like the ENSEAL product that I just described were recently produced. So I\u2019d say more competitive pressures in surgery, less so in orthopedics if you were distinguishing those two particular markets.","Operator","Your next question is from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just going back to the guidance and I guess increasing the constant currency sales guidance, I just want to be clear on what gives you I guess the comfort that you can raise it at this stage of the year especially given or you just described as being generally weak I guess within the medical device business and it sounds like your expectations for utilization in that category or more moderate relative to what you saw entering the year.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Kristen. So that\u2019s a good observation obviously, but as you know we have a broad based business. So even though we may see some weakness in the MD&D market, we\u2019re very pleased with the launch of the products in the pharmaceutical market. We did have the adjustment that Louise described that was obviously positive for the quarter and positive for the year and our consumer business is also a very good start as well and we expect that to pick up as products continue to come into the marketplace from the products that were previously off the market. So overall the breadth of our business allows us to feel comfortable and although some areas of the business we may experience some market weaknesses, other areas of the business are more than picking up. So that gives us good confidence to lean forward in terms of how our business is doing for the balance of 2013.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then any update on the diagnostics business just in terms of your thinking on that franchise, whether it\u2019s a spin-off of selling it?","Dominic Caruso","No. No update just yet. We\u2019re still going through the process and it\u2019s probably too early to comment.","Operator","Your next question is from Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","My question first on the consumer business, it looks like OTC had a nice rebound. I was wondering if you could talk about where you\u2019re at with bringing those products back to the market. I think you\u2019d previously talked about having the key products back by the end of the year. is this on track? Are you perhaps doing a little bit better there? And then as a colorary to that, the margins in the consumer business are obviously quite depressed right now and maybe talk about the path to improving margins in that business over the longer term.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Rajeev. Well, we are very pleased with the rebound in the consumer business. As you saw, the OTC business in the U.S was up 14%. I think that has to do with two things, the expected rollout of our products back in the marketplace, but also a pretty healthy, I can say that in quotes, \u201chealthy\u201d cold and flu season from our perspective. So I think we did benefit from that. I think we are basically on track as we thought we would be to return about 75% of the products that were previously off the market to back on to the market. So our plan is unfolding as we have predicted it would and it looks like we are going to see a buildup throughout the remainder of the year. You know both the intermittent supply differences between the products, so it's not as if 75% of the entire volume is back in the business but 75% of the brands will be on the shelves by the end of the year, we feel pretty confident about that.","In terms of managing margins, in that business I think our team of leaders and consumer have done a very good job of managing in a very tough time and they will continue to do that, I am sure, going forward. And as the OTC products return to the marketplace, continue to build back share, that\u2019s obviously a very profitable piece of the business so we would expect that they would improve their margins accordingly. I would caution, though, in terms of making sure that you understand that when these products come back to the market, we are going to do whatever we can to gain share and invest appropriately behind them. So we think that investment now will more than pay off in the future. So we would expect the return of profitability would be tempered in the consumer business as we do the right things to bring the products back to the market.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","Thank you. I just have one follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind, on INVOKANA. Perhaps you could talk about the resources you are putting behind that launch and I know we will talk about this in a month or so at the pharma meetings, but where do you see this class in the broader spectrum of diabetes care. Thank you very much.","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Let me defer the comment on the broader class of diabetes care until May 23rd when we have our experts there. Obviously I hope you will be there as well others, to hear from our leaders who have much more knowledge about that market. But we are obviously very pleased with having this approval of the first in its class, and the indication as you know is broad and the adverse event profile is very manageable. So we think this is an important addition to the armamentarium of care for diabetes patients. So I will let Joakim and others in our business to talk about the impact that they see overall in the marketplace.","I would say that overall the pharma business is doing well, really well. So we are very pleased with that. And the launches have gone incredibly well despite the fact that we have seen some competition as you all know. I mean you all have written very vividly about the new products come in the market in various classes like in XARELTO's class and in ZYTIGA's class. So you get the products pretty well. So I say that because we have really focused our efforts on clinically differentiating our products and I say that about INVOKANA as well. And I think our scientific teams led by Paul Stoffels and Bill Hait have done a great job of selecting the right clinical profile for the market place.","And then coupled with the commercial excellence that\u2019s led by Joakim and his team, that\u2019s a great combination. So we feel very good about our progress in the pharmaceutical marketplace.","Louise Mehrotra","Do you have one more question?","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","I did, and I apologize I am dragging on. But, Dominic, you take the [pharma] you said it's quite well, consumer, there is some opportunity for margin perhaps longer term. How do you feel about the long-term margin trajectory of the company, and that\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Yeah. Well, Rajeev, you know, we have good healthy margins today. We are managing through what I mentioned at our call in January when I was with you all. That as of now, we have $1 billion of cost of U.S. healthcare legislation embedded in our business and we are able to manage through that. So I give our business leaders around the world a lot of credit for being able to manage in the various dynamics of the marketplace including slower growth markets and including areas of the business where cost pressures are continuing. So I think we have done a good job at doing that and I expect we will continue to do a good job of doing that, and we will always keep a focus on investing appropriately for the future.","So each time we give guidance, hopefully you will get a clear picture of how we are doing that while also investing in the future, but I\u2019ll say it\u2019s not easy but I give a lot of credit to the teams of people and leaders around the world who are experts at being able to manage well in challenging times.","Operator","Your next question is from Derrick Sung with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein","I wanted to go back to procedure volumes, in particular get some color from you on what you\u2019re seeing in Europe. On the MD&D side, how much of the selling days impacted your European years? Maybe if you can comment specifically on orthopedics, how much of the slowdown there was selling days versus procedure volume.","Dominic Caruso","I\u2019ll ask Louise to help me with that, but of course in Europe you have the dynamics of the Easter holiday season as well as that was in the first quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of last year. Louise, maybe you can give some more specifics on the particular question that Derrick is asking.","Louise Mehrotra","Sure. The U.S it was about one day and in Europe it was probably about two days and you know that\u2019s rather a rough calculation, but it impacted growth about 1.5% in terms of sales, about 1% in the U.S and about I think 2.5% outside the U.S.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay, but generally speaking your sense is that, are you seeing any change say from Q4 in terms of austerity measures procedure volumes, things of that nature, anything that you\u2019d call out?","Louise Mehrotra","In terms of the austerity measures, it\u2019s very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter, but we are still feeling it as everybody else is feeling it, but we are the first company that\u2019s out. So we need to wait for the others to report.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. While you\u2019re going through your numbers, would you mind giving us the price mix write down for hips, knees and spine in the U.S?","Louise Mehrotra","Sure. So in the U.S, in the first quarter, price was down about 4% and that\u2019s fairly similar to what it was in the fourth quarter, a little bit more unfavorable. And in terms of mix, it was actually 1% favorable. So you came out to about a 3% unfavorable for the hips. In terms of knees, it\u2019s about 2% unfavorable, 1.5%, 2% unfavorable and totally offset by favorable mix. So you actually come to about 0.5 a point favorable on the knee.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein","And what about spine?","Louise Mehrotra","In terms of spine, we are about 3% negative in price and again this is only U.S and we are positive in terms of mix by about 4%. So netting about 1% positive.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein","Maybe just one more quickly for Dominic. I noticed that in your special items you increased accrual due to pending litigation on product liability. I was just wondering if you could comment there on, remind us on the total amount of accruals that you\u2019re taking and maybe also if you can comment on how these pending product litigations might impact your thinking around use of cash as you move forward. Just help us get comfortable with that.","Dominic Caruso","Well, with respect to the total accrual comment there, I\u2019m not going to comment specifically and I\u2019ll just refer you to our 10-K disclosures regarding the status of the various legal matters. In terms of use of cash, these litigation accruals obviously sometimes extend for years until the actual cash is disbursed. So although we contemplated in our cash planning, I don\u2019t necessarily associate the specific accrual on any one quarter or any one year with the cash impact in any quarter or any one year and I\u2019m happy to say as you know, we generate substantially strong cash flows year in and year out and now the team will continue to focus on that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","I\u2019d like to focus for a minute if we could within the pharmaceutical division and particularly again with ZYTIGA. There was a patient assistance program in Q4. I assume that had concluded and actually led to fairly substantial sales in Q1 and I\u2019m curious if we can break that apart, that is to say does that affect continuing to Q2? The second part of the question is around international demand which was up 22% sequentially and again very, very strong demand. Was that due to the countries which I realize Louise I think you mentioned 70 odd, 79 particular countries which were approved but still extremely strong growth and I recognize that there was a pre-chemo approval earlier in the year. Was that the principal driver? And the last question again on the same product really is, is there any attempt to give some consideration of strategy around the patent extension of the product. Thanks very much.","Louise Mehrotra","I will take the first one on the patient assistance. So we have a patient assistance program in place and it continues to be in place. It's part of what we do for all of our products. What you saw in the fourth quarter was a replenishment to the wholesalers of certain of the ZYTIGA products. So it has nothing to do with whether or not we have implemented a patient assistance program, we always have patient assistance programs in place for people that need the products.","Dominic Caruso","Right. With respect to the balance of the questions on ZYTIGA, I am going to not comment currently on the status of patent extension strategies, except to say that obviously our teams are working on that. In terms of the overall impact of ZYTIGA's worldwide sales, other than what Louise mentioned on patient assistance which is not really a major impact. The major impacts you did see were the chemo na\u00efve indication, and you are absolutely right, Tony, a number of new markets outside the U.S., specifically in Europe, came online during the quarter and will continue to come online for the balance of the year. So those two factors, pre-chemo and additional country approvals are the major drivers of the uptake in ZYTIGA sales.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Couple of things. Dominic, back to the U.S. weakness question. Did you actually expect a stronger O-U.S. performance ex all the noise and did the weakness that you clearly saw and are talking about, did it accelerate or pickup throughout the quarter or was it just consistently below fourth quarter trends?","Dominic Caruso","So just to clarify your question, the weakness that you are referring to in the U.S. is in the medical device business, not in pharma, not in consumer.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Exactly.","Dominic Caruso","And you are right, there was a lot of noise in the quarter and we tried to parse through that. After parsing through all the noise including selling days etcetera, Louise's  data indicated -- Louise's comments indicated that overall the medical device business is probably flat or modestly increased in the first quarter. But the major driver of that is in fact the utilization trends that we did not see accelerate in the first quarter across primarily the surgery businesses including outpatient surgeries etcetera, and some competitive pressures that I have mentioned earlier. So I can't comment specifically month-by-month in the quarter but I would say that overall the trends that you saw a modest uptick in the fourth quarter did not persist into the first quarter. So whether that's seasonality and how people use their  high deductible insurance plans or not, we will have to wait and see as others report, but that maybe a contributing factor and we expected to see some of that in the first quarter.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","And I think you also mentioned Dominic that possible inventory levels were down, I would say again, because I saw we would be through most of that process. Is it much more to go there or is that actually something encouraging for later quarters?","Dominic Caruso","Yeah, I think that in this particular quarter from the best information we have is related to system implementations and other factors and the particular distributors that we deal with and not something that we would expect to continue happening for the remaining quarters of the year.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. And one last one. At the January analyst day, obviously by talking about exploring strategic alternatives for diagnostics, it seems like Alex both by that statement and just his tone, was signaling a bit more active stance towards portfolio review. You are always buying and selling and reviewing, but should be expect a little more active stance now with Alex on board and given the ongoing challenges. Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","So, Rick, well, I think as Alex mentioned in his commentary that we always obviously look at our portfolio in a strategic way. I think with changes in the marketplace that we see happening in healthcare, I think it's even more important for us to be very discerning and very deliberate about the places we will play in where we can make a big difference and areas where we may not be able to make a difference or where in fact, investment may not be worth it or the property maybe better in someone else's hands. So I don\u2019t know that it's precisely related to just Alex being on board, although that\u2019s always been a strategic focus of Alex even before he became CEO, but I think it\u2019s also how we adapt and how our management teams adapt to an ever changing marketplace. So I think we\u2019ll continue to be deliberate in that regard and obviously we\u2019ll update you along the way.","Operator","Your next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Dominic, can you just elaborate a little bit further on the managed Medicaid true-up? I\u2019m confused about that that came on the left field. You had talked about how that impacted immunology and neurology products. Is that a onetime impact or do these growth rates reflect the organic growth rates that we should anticipate going forward? How do we think about that with respect to the numbers going forward for future quarters? And the other question relates to sequestration. You have a number of products that are reimbursed through Medicare part B including REMICADE and as you know there as a 2% reduction to Medicare part B which impacts part B\u2019s ASP plus 6. So obviously Q1 didn\u2019t reflect this, but are you seeing anything out there that could have some impact on your Medicare part B business? Thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Jami. Thanks for the question. Well, with respect to the adjustment for the managed Medicare rebates and I\u2019ll let Louise provide some additional color here, it\u2019s pretty obvious that that level of adjustment is not really reflective of the current run rate of the product. So as Louise in her comments described the fact that excluding that adjustment, the pharmaceutical business in the U.S and worldwide, the underlying growth rate was 8%. So it\u2019s not the 14% or 11% that you saw in the numbers because that would be less than transparent if we told you that. But the underlying rate of 8% is something we\u2019re quite proud of to be honest. So nonetheless even despite that adjustment, the business is doing very well with a very healthy growth rate of 8%.","This adjustment as I mentioned earlier relates to a catch up of Medicaid rebates for managed Medicaid in the States under the new legislation and various states across the United States that provided this information most recently to all pharmaceutical players and us in particular we took a look at all that data now that we have it in hand, although it\u2019s not all in hand. So there may be some additional adjustments going forward and we\u2019ll be transparent again if that should happen. Having said that, the level of rebates in the States that we have previously predicted are now predicted to be lower. That\u2019s why we included this adjustment in our sales because we have previously reflected too high on rebate for example.","So going forward, although the adjustment may not be that significant, the overall level of rebates are expected to be quite lower than we previously thought. And with respect to Medicaid part B and REMICADE, we\u2019re obviously aware of the sequestration impact and you\u2019re right, REMICADE is a significant product that reimbursement of the Medicare Part B and beginning in April we instituted a program with our REMICADE infusion customers on their contract to receive a discount on the continued use of REMICADE to help them deal with and help them offset the impact of this reimbursement that they\u2019ll see.","Louise Mehrotra","And just for some context, REMICADE is about a third of Medicare and PROCRIT also impacts about 60% Medicare.","Operator","Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","Just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about Synthes integration and how that\u2019s going, particularly on any potential sales force turnover side and if there is any change to when we could see accretion on the EDS side of things from Synthes. And to follow up on Rick\u2019s question about potentially more activity on the M&A and or divestiture front, on the context of the med-tech market that we was in today, so specifically in MD&D business, where do you see potential opportunities, understanding that you just made this big acquisition with Synthes, but maybe even something smaller or another big acquisition. Where do you see opportunities in med-tech for growth over the next five plus years? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Well Danielle, the integration of Synthes is going well. I would say that the challenge as we expected was going to be in the area of integrating the spine sales forces. You may recall that we converted our current legacy DePuy spine business from a distributor based system to a direct selling basis, which is what Synthes had in mind, was doing. And we had always expected that would be the way to go in the marketplace. So we have completed that transition. And I would say there are some disruptions that we have seen as a result, not totally unexpected but in fact some disruptions. But we think that\u2019s a short-term issue because we think that\u2019s a long-term benefit of having a direct sales force plus the combination of the two portfolios. It's something that will allow us to compete very effectively in spine space.","In terms of accretion, the focus of the business integration now is really on sales synergies and we are starting to see some sales synergies. It's too early to give you a specific number on that. The focus is primarily on sales synergies as opposed to the cost synergies, and we expect that that will improve as the integration continues to progress throughout this year and into next. And with respect to M&A and divestiture activities, we are very active always in M&A and divestiture activity as you know. And with our broad base in healthcare and our broad purview of the medical device sector, we look at all areas of medical device to see where we can make a difference.","And what enters into calculus, Daniel, as you heard me say before, is not only where we would like to play but where we think the asset is not only better in our hands but has a current valuation that\u2019s attractive to us and is not, for example, overvalued. So we will always look at that. I can't give you any specifics, but with a broad-based medical device business that we have, there is lots of areas for us to look at to improve on if in fact that acquisition would create shareholder value. That\u2019s our number one criteria when looking at the acquisition potential.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","Okay. Perfect. One quick follow-up on spine if I could. Any changes underlying the endorsement trends there?","Dominic Caruso","I haven\u2019t seen anything in particular in the data, Louise, have you seen anything?","Louise Mehrotra","Not that I am aware of. With respect to everyone's time, we will take one more question and then we will have Dominic sum up with some final remarks.","Operator","Your final question is through the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Thanks so much for squeezing us in. I just had a follow-up and I am sorry to bead this dead horse here on the utilization side. But, Dominic, just to clarify, the comments that you are making about the trends, the general surgery trends. In the past, sometimes these have been kind of coming out of your suture business and the scope and visibility you have into surgery and in the past sometimes it's been a trailing indicator. I am wondering, just to be clear, are the metrics that you are able to provide color up through March or is part of it through December, just a clarification and then I have one follow up.","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Let me have Louise answer that. She has that data right in front of her.","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. So we have good data up till the fourth quarter. And as you know we are one of the first ones out in the first quarter, but we do a lot of market research. We have a very good team that extracts data from other companies reports, quite frankly, analyst reports. So that\u2019s kind of an amalgamation of it. It's not precise, it's where we think it's directional at this point in time and of course we will know a lot more once we get the data from the other company. There is some noise in our suture numbers in the quarter and if I take out that noise in the suture numbers, it's flat on a worldwide basis and is actually positive about 2% on U.S. basis excluding the noise that we had in our own numbers at that point. Okay.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","And that would have compared to the prior quarter?","Louise Mehrotra","Similar results. Similar.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Okay. So similar [sideways] if you will, from a group standpoint?","Louise Mehrotra","Yes.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","And then the other follow-up I had was on -- I appreciate all the color on price and mix, you had given some particular color on spine over the last few quarters. And I guess knees and spine have started to kind of trend positive on a price mix basis. Having [listed] last several years that\u2019s sort of an anomaly a little bit for us I think. And I just wanted to get a sense, if you have any color as to what's improving there? What's enabling you to sort of either moderate the pricing pressure or get back on the -- effectively drive mix?","Louise Mehrotra","I think mix comes from innovation of new products and that\u2019s where the positive mix impact is coming from.","Dominic Caruso","That\u2019s right, Louise. I mean we can't ever lose track of the fact that innovation is the name of the game in all these markets. So as we continue to innovate, hopefully we\u2019ll get a positive mix equation out of it and that\u2019s what our leaders and folks in the labs and our engineers et cetera are totally focused on and they do a pretty good job of it. So we\u2019ll just continue to look for that as hopeful in terms of mix being positive because overall price regardless of mix is going to be pretty hard to come by as you all know. So I think our focus has always been, needs to continue to be on innovating in these markets.","Louise Mehrotra","Final remarks?","Dominic Caruso","Thanks everyone for tuning in today. As I said earlier, we\u2019re off to a very good start in Q1 and we remain optimistic for the remainder of the year. we see further opportunities to drive growth in this dynamic global marketplace as our new products, our robust pipelines and even our core businesses continue to address the critical unmet healthcare needs of patients and customers. I would like to again thank the people of Johnson & Johnson for their dedication and commitment and I look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year, including at our upcoming pharmaceutical business review on May 23. So thanks for your time this morning and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning and welcome. I\u2019m Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2014. Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details.","This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing third quarter results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2014. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour.","Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today\u2019s commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 and the company\u2019s subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today.","The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the company and on our website.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.","Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.","Now, I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion for the third quarter of 2014, up 5.1%. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.8% and currency had a negative impact of 0.7%. In the U.S., sales were up 11.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 1%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 1.3%.","On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 3.5%, Asia Pacific, Africa region grew 2% and Europe declined 0.8%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products in all regions was partially offset by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the impact of divestitures, underlying operational growth was approximately 9%.","Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.7 billion and earnings per share were $1.66 versus $1.04 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net gain of $457 million for after tax special items. Third quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $937 million for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.","Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.50, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2013.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represents operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translational impact. I\u2019ll begin with the Consumer segment.","Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.3% with U.S. sales down 4.2%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 2.6%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was approximately 2.5% with U.S. growth of approximately 1.5% and growth outside the U.S. were approximately 3%.","Major drivers of the results were over-the-counter and oral care products offset by the divestiture of the North American Sanitary Protection business. OTC sales growth was driven by upper respiratory products and analgesics. Upper respiratory products grew 10% worldwide driven by sales growth outside the U.S., which included an early seasonal inventory build.","Analgesic growth was 7% in U.S. driven by market share gains, partially offset by comparisons to the third quarter 2013 trade inventory build related to the re-launch of the products.","In the U.S. adult analgesic market share was approximately 11%, up from 8.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was over 40%, up from 26% a year ago. Oral care results were driven by strong results for LISTERINE due to new product launches and successful marketing campaigns.","Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.3 billion increased 18.7%, with U.S. sales up 33.1% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.1%, driven by both strong sales of new products, as well as core growth products.","A major driver was our recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and EU and SOVRIAD in Japan. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 8%, 14% and 1.5%, respectively.","Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA, REMICADE and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA, as well as XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA\/XEPLION and recently launched IMBRUVICA. Partially offsetting the growth were lower sales of ACIPHEX due to generic competition and lower sales of vaccines.","The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth complemented by increased market share for STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. We continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology.","XARELTO sales were up 68%, compared with the same quarter last year and grew 14.5% on a sequential basis. Total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 14.5%, with cardiology TRx estimated at 23.5%.","INVOKANA sales contributed over three and a half points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate and for the quarter achieved 3.2% TRx within the defined market of type II diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 2.4% in the second quarter of 2014. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 9.2% for the quarter, up approximately 1.5% sequentially.","The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market and estimated market growth of 11%. ZYTIGA has captured approximately 33.5% of that market. Continued strong market uptick and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 90 countries.","I will now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostic segment sales of $6.6 billion decreased 4.6%. U.S. sales declined 6.5%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the OCD divestiture, worldwide growth was 1.6% while U.S. growth was 0.6% and growth outside the U.S. was 2.4%. Growth was driven by orthopedics and cardiovascular care, partially offset by lower sales in vision care and surgical care. Competitive pricing dynamics impacted growth for vision care.","In surgical care, the success of the ECHELONFLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler outside the U.S. was offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products, coupled with U.S. pricing pressure. Orthopedic sales growth was driven by trauma, sports medicine, knees and hips. Trauma was up 3% worldwide due to market growth and new product launches, while the successful launch of MONOVISC, coupled with the continued strong growth for ORTHOVISC drove results for sports medicine.","Hip growth of 4% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were major contributors to the results. Knees worldwide increased 5% due to the successful launch of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure across the regions. Cardiovascular growth was driven by an 18% worldwide increase in our BioSense Webster business due to strong growth of the ThermoCool SmartTouch catheter.","That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter of 2014. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Good morning, everyone and thank you, Louise for sharing the highlights from our performance in the third quarter. We are very pleased with our strong performance this past quarter as well as the progress we've made on our long-term growth drivers. I believe we are well positioned in this evolving healthcare environment.","I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some of the progress we've made to advance our business, as well as to review some additional highlights of our financial performance for the third quarter. Then, I will provide our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2014.","But before I do that, I want to comment on what we're seeing in the market for healthcare. Although modest, we have now seen two consecutive quarters of positive momentum in hospital utilization rates, which is in line with recently published analysts\u2019 reports noting the strength. We continued to remain confident that as economies recover and as healthcare reform continues to gain momentum here in the U.S. and abroad, utilization rates are going to increase.","At Johnson & Johnson, we\u2019ve continued making very good progress on our near-term priorities of achieving our financial commitments, restoring and relaunching our U.S. OTC products, continuing to capitalize on the potential of the DePuy Synthes acquisition and building on our strong momentum in Pharmaceuticals. At the same time, we\u2019ve continued to focus on advancing our long-term growth drivers, which you're familiar with from our previous discussions.","During the quarter, we've made several significant advancements against these long-term growth drivers that are worth noting. We continued to create value through innovation as evidenced by the strong performance of our newly launched products as well as by gaining regulatory approval for expanded uses of important products in our portfolio such as INVOKAMET, which is a combination of INVOKANA and metformin into a single pill to treat diabetes that the FDA approved in August.","Further, IMBRUVICA added a third indication in July, when the FDA approved it for use in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, who have a specific genetic mutation that occurs when part of chromosome 17 is missing. That's an important advancement for these patients who are considered to have the poorest prognosis and very limited treatment options.","The CHMP also recommended IMBRUVICA for approval for similar uses in Europe. And just yesterday, we announced that we entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pharmacyclics to evaluate IMBRUVICA in combination with an investigational PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor as a potential option for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And in our cardiovascular business, we launched INCRAFT Stent-Graft System for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms in both Europe and Canada.","Looking longer-term, we continued to make important investments to access early-stage innovation. In the quarter, we acquired Covagen, the company that is focused on developing new therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of inflammatory diseases. On September 30th, we announced an agreement to acquire Alios Biopharma, which will give us a promising Phase 2 potential treatment for RSD, a major pediatric disease with no effective therapy available for prevention or treatment. Their pipeline also includes two early-stage compounds for hepatitis C that could potentially augment our existing portfolio. We anticipate that the Alios acquisition will close later this quarter. And we are also leading with purpose, as demonstrated through our partnership with the NIH to fast-track the development of an Ebola vaccine.","Now let's review some highlights from the quarter. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2014, which reflects both the success of our new products and the strength of our core businesses. We\u2019re pleased to show strong reported sales growth in the quarter of 5.1% or 5.8% operationally as we showed you earlier. This growth was driven in part by the continued uptake of our newly launched Pharmaceutical products including hepatitis C treatment OLYSIO, which is sold as SOVRIAD in Japan.","Please note that this is the first quarter reflecting the divestiture of our Ortho Clinical Diagnostics business. And in order to mitigate the EPS impact on future earnings from the OCD divestiture, you\u2019ll recall that in July we announced a $5 billion share repurchase program. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, our sales increased nearly 8.5% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our hepatitis C products contributed approximately 1.5% of that growth.","Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we\u2019ve provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. Adjusted net earnings were $4.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.5% over the third quarter 2013, and adjusted earnings per share were $1.50 in the quarter versus $1.36 a year ago, which was up 10.3%, exceeding the mean of the analysts\u2019 estimates as published by first call.","Profitability from sales of OLYSIO, net of investments we made, contributed approximately $0.06 of EPS this quarter and approximately $0.20 of EPS for the nine months of this year. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the following special items. The net gains associated with the OCD divestiture, costs associated with the continued integration of Synthes, additional reserves for litigation expenses under the DePuy ASR Hip program and an approval for final IRS regulations related to the branded prescription drug fee.","Let me now provide some background about the branded prescription drug fee, which we have treated as a special item this quarter. As you know in 2011, we and all participants in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry were required under the Affordable Care Act legislation to begin paying the fee based on our respective shares of branded prescription drugs sold to the U.S. government.","The accounting for that fee has been consistently applied by the industry since that passage of the act as agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the third quarter, the IRS issued final regulations, which had the effect of changing the recognition of the fee for accounting purposes from the period in which the fee is paid to the period from which market shares used to allocate the fee are determined. Therefore, we and other industry participants are now required to record an additional year of the fee. Note that as the fee is still payable as originally provided for in the act, there is no resulting cash flow impact.","Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I'm pleased to point out that we saw very good operating performance. Cost of goods sold was 120 basis points lower than the same period last year primarily due to our product mix offset by currency impact.","Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 60 basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2013 due to the growth of new products in our pharmaceutical business and overall good management of cost primarily in our MD&D business. These factors more than offset the inclusion of an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, which I described earlier.","Excluding the impact of this fee, which we have treated as a special item, these expenses were 180 basis points lower than in the prior year. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was down compared to the prior year primarily due to timing of various R&D programs that we have and we will continue to make important R&D investments for the future.","Overall, our pretax operating margin increased 240 basis points. And excluding the incremental accrual for the additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, pretax operating margins increased 360 basis points. OLYSIO was a major contributor representing slightly more than one half of that increase.","Interest expense net of interest income are approximately $112 million was slightly higher than the prior year. Other income net of other expenses was $1.3 billion in the quarter as again, compared to $943 million of expense in the same period last year. Now excluding the special items that were included in this line item, other income net of other expenses show the net expense of $25 million this quarter versus a net gain of $43 million in the prior year.","In the quarter, the effective tax rate excluding special items was 24.2% compared to 18.9% in the third quarter of 2013 and for nine months excluding special items, the tax rate was 21.9% compared to 19.3% in the same period last year. This was due primarily to the geographic mix of the results in each of the periods.","Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for the balance of 2014. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I will give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast beginning with cash and interest income and expense.","At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17.7 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $33 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $15.3 billion of debt. For purposes of your models, assuming no major additional acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $500 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance.","Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2014 reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $300 million to $400 million, which is lower than our previous guidance.","And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress. And although that has not yet occurred, we do anticipate that it will be retroactive for the full year when it is eventually passed consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact our effective tax rate by approximately 0.5%.","We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014 excluding special items of approximately 20% to 21%. This is an increase in our effective tax rate to reflect a higher portion of our earnings this year being subject to the U.S. tax rate. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate.","Turning to guidance on sales and earnings. As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.","We will also provide an estimate of our sales and earnings per share results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in previous quarters.","For sales, our assumptions remain consistent from earlier guidance that PROCRIT will not have biosimilar competition in 2014. And for INVEGA, SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not anticipate generic entries for these products this year.","Further, our guidance reflects net incremental sales from our hepatitis C products as well the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 5.5% and 6.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. This is an increase to our previous guidance.","Our underlying operational sales growth in this 2014 guidance excluding the impact of the hepatitis C products and the OCD divestiture for the full year 2014 is approximately 4.5%, a higher growth rate than the estimate we provided on last quarter's earnings call. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year than our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 1.5%, reflecting the recent weakening of the euro and other currencies against the U.S. dollar.","Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to range between 4% and 5% for total expected level of reported sales of between approximately $74 billion and $75 billion. Our 2014 earnings guidance reflects the strength of our performance we've seen thus far including a strong contribution of OLYSIO which as I noted earlier contributed approximately $0.20 to 2014 EPS for the first nine months, net of investments we've made in the business. Therefore we suggest you consider full year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items of between $5.94 and $5.99 per share on operational or constant currency basis, which is higher than our previous guidance.","Moving to reported EPS, again we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of this year than our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share due to exchange rate fluctuations. This represents a $0.07 per share unfavorable swing from our previous guidance, with the weakening euro as a major factor.","We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS, excluding special items, in the range between $5.92 and $5.97 per share for growth rate of about 7% to 8%. This is higher than our previous guidance, as our strong operational earnings performance is more than offsetting the negative impact of currency movements. And as a reminder, our full year earnings guidance includes intangible amortization of approximately $1.4 billion before tax, or an impact of approximately $0.38 on earnings per share.","Please note that our guidance does not include the impact of an official devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar or any other currency. And while we\u2019re not providing guidance for 2015, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for all of 2015, that impact would be a headwind to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share.","As you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating margins will show a significant improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels, and approximately half of that is attributed to OLYSIO net of the additional investments we\u2019re making in the business.","In summary, we are very pleased with our strong results this quarter and with our ability to deliver an even stronger earnings performance for the full year than our previous guidance. Our new products continue to produce strong growth and we are advancing our near-term priorities while also continuing to make investments to fuel future growth.","Now I would like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. And Stephanie, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Dominic Caruso","Good morning, Mike","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So Dominic, first, one clarification, the $0.06, you called out this quarter and $0.20 for the year for OLYSIO, that would seem to imply probably about $0.20 and more of investments netted against that to get to that $0.20 number. So, can you just maybe outline that the $0.20 versus what profitability could have been for that product?","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Mike. We are not going to give very specific profitability by product. But generally speaking, when we saw the uptick in OLYSIO sales this year, we knew we had the opportunity to invest more in the business, including both some marketing investment as well as new R&D program. So we expected that we would do that while still having our investors see the benefits of the uptick in the OLYSIO product. So I can\u2019t give you the specifics, but generally speaking about $0.20 for the year. I mean, if you assume that OLYSIO is a high margin -- high gross margin product with very, very little costs associated with it, you can probably estimate what the total impact would be.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","And do you view that $0.20 as one-time, essentially going away next year. Is that you want these rates to be picking up in \u201815?","Dominic Caruso","Yeah. I think so, because it\u2019s obvious that we saw such a significant uptick this quarter and you all know that Gilead\u2019s compound in this space was just approved Friday. I think we all expected that. So we took the opportunity to invest. I think we're being very transparent with investors of what the impact to this year's earnings are net of the investments, of course. And yes, we don't expect that that will continue into next year.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","One last question. Could you walk through the assumptions that you\u2019ve laid for this year relative to biosimilar competition? Do you have any preliminary comments relative to 2015? And are you thinking about competition for REMICADE or can you give a product from the portfolio?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Louise, we have spoken before about the fact that 2015 is biosimilar impact for REMICADE in Europe, in particular.","Louise Mehrotra","Correct. And as far as INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we are not aware of any ANDA filings on them at this point in time.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Perfect. I will let others jump in. Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Thanks, Mike.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Larry.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question about international growth, which has slowed the last couple quarters. The U.S. has obviously been very strong, but can you talk about what you're seeing outside the U.S. and why the U.S. -- O-U.S. I am sorry isn\u2019t growing quite as robustly as the U.S.? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Right. Well, couple things. This quarter of course, we have the impact of the OCD divestiture, so the quarter-over-quarter comparisons are difficult for that. So Europe, I think you saw published operational growth of negative 0.8%. Without the OCD impact, it would've been positive 1% growth. That is slower growth than we\u2019ve seen before. I think you're all very familiar with the fact that Europe is in fact slowing down and we're seeing that across our businesses as well.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","And then Dominic, on Vision Care, it was down 13% this quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color about what's going on there? Is that a market issue? Is that a J&J specific issue? And how long do you think it will take to recover? Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Right. Well, we mentioned in the comments by Louise earlier that there is some competitive pricing dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the market for our Vision Care products. So we took the opportunity to price we set, some of our products in that marketplace. We have a lot of new and important innovations coming to market soon. And when we noticed what was going on in the market, we want to price our products competitively with those in anticipation of the new products we have coming in the near future. So I would say there is a little bit of a slowdown in overall market, but the impact you saw for our business was primarily a result of our price we set.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks for taking the question.","Dominic Caruso","Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Jami.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Jami.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Just if you don\u2019t mind, if I follow up a little bit on OLYSIO. So just to be clear Dominic, you said $0.06 net of investments, are you talking net of general investments, or net of investments in hep C? I mean, what is your commitment level to hep C going forward? And given the new pricing around the Gilead combo, it would seem that OLYSIO, even if you cut the price dramatically would have a hard time competing. Are you planning to cut the price and would you expect the $2 billion that you\u2019ve generated year-to-date to just basically go away next year? And then just lastly, back to the margin contribution, I think you were a little bit more explicit on the previous call. I think you had said two-thirds of a 230 basis point improvement was attributed to OLYSIO. If I assume the same thing this quarter, that would have led to about $0.15 contribution and that of course it does not include investments. So if you could just confirm that. And then lastly, I am obliged to ask this, do you have any double Irish exposure? Thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Well, let me say, I think I counted eight questions Jami, so I am going to do more.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","I am going to get this opportunity four times a year.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. So just to be clear, when I talk about the impact of OLYSIO net of investments, I am talking about net of all investments, not just investments in hep C. So investments across the full range of the Johnson & Johnson portfolio. We are committed to hep C. We continue to do studies in combination with other products. We think there is important new advances still available in that marketplace. We think the market is substantial and it\u2019s worth pursuing. So we are still committed to investment there and we\u2019re doing those clinical trials.","As you know, we have already filed with the FDA for our combination of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir and then we have additional data coming out, I think, later this year in addition to that.","And then, finally you would ask about pricing given the impact of Gilead\u2019s new pricing for Harvoni, I believe the product is called. And I would just offer the following comments. First of all, we believe that OLYSIO is in fact a very good -- has very good safety and efficacy results, in a strong position in patient experienced to date. We plan to remain competitive in the hepatitis C category and we will work with payers to maintain access for OLYSIO in the marketplace.","And given the size, complexity and diversity of this patient population, we think physicians will continue to need multiple treatment options and hence my comment earlier about our commitment to continue to study OLYSIO for hep C as well some other combinations. We think having a potent protease inhibitor available to physicians is important and we\u2019re committed to doing that.","As far as Double Dutch or Irish Sandwiches or whatever they are called, I'm not going to comment very specifically about what we do or we don't have but we\u2019ll have to wait to see what the Irish legislation actually says. But we understand from all the comments that have been made by Irish regulators that there will certainly be some grandfathering period for any changes that they propose because they do expect to keep Ireland competitive in the world economy.","So we certainly expect that there will be some grandfather period. I don't know how long it will be but we've heard in the range of five years, could be three to five, could be five to seven. But we expect that the grandfathering provisions will give us all enough time to adjust any plans that we might have as a result of any impact.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","You\u2019re welcome.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Glenn.","Dominic Caruso","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. I want to focus on your orthopedics business. Your U.S. knees and your U.S. hips came in a little bit better than we were thinking. So Dominic and Louise, can you provide some commentary about what you see on the U.S side in terms of volumes? Are things feeling a little bit better after kind of a softer first half and then as a follow-up Louise, you mentioned in your prepared remarks pricing pressure. I wonder if you can characterize the pressure that you saw in 3Q compared to how you saw it in 2Q and 1Q? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Well, let me start with just a few comments on volumes. We did see increased volume in the third quarter. Consistent with what we expected where we thought that the second half of the year would be stronger than the first half of the year. Just by the way of reference, last year, our hip and knee growth we experienced 70% of that growth in the fourth quarter.","So obviously, we've now seen a new seasonality that\u2019s very clear in hip and knee market. And we\u2019ve seen an uptick in the third quarter or in the back half of the year as we expected, we would see. And Louise on pricing.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. And so just a little further on the market, so we are the first one though but our best estimate of the U.S market growth for the third quarter was hips about 3%. We grew slightly faster and knees about 4%, which we also grew slightly faster. But that\u2019s again, just a big estimate because we\u2019re the first or second one out, depending on how you count it.","Regarding price, so in hips this is U.S only, price was minus 5%, which is additional negative by 1% versus sequential basis and mix was virtually flat. So net net price mix in the U.S for hips was down about 5%. For knees, price was negative 2.2% so that's a little better than the second quarter. Mix coming in about 1.5% positive so negative minus 0.6 on the quarter price and mix together and that\u2019s better than the second quarter.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","As a follow-up, Louise, that negative 5 on hips, that\u2019s a big number. Do you have any commentary why negative 5? We\u2019ve been kind of thinking the market overall for hips would be down more 2 to 3 and you\u2019re coming in at negative 5. Was there any contract that rolled off any additional commentary you can provide? Thanks.","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. There were some additional contracts that were renewed in the third quarter and that is you\u2019re seeing the impact in that minus 5%.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. And did you want to do spine price in the U.S is down 5% and that\u2019s more negative versus the second quarter. Mix is up a positive of 1% for a negative of 4% altogether price mix for spine in U.S.","Dominic Caruso","Okay.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, some of the follow-up on your biosimilar comments for next year? So few things, can you help us think about how we should think about the impact of competition in Europe sort of relative to, maybe what you\u2019ve seen with your [Eagle] (ph) franchise and such?","And then in the U.S in terms of the biosimilar threat there, last month the U.S. Patent Office issued a final rejection on one of the key REMICADE patents under re-examination? Now we understand that the final rejection still has an appeals process to it? But I was wondering if you could kind of give us some insight into what that appeals process is and how you think about the -- your IP position in the U.S with potential FDA approval of Celltrion, REMICADE next year as well?","Dominic Caruso","So, Derrick, thanks for the question. So biosimilars in the OUS first, we haven't seen much of an impact and we know that that even pricing is sort of in the 30% range down from the branded product, but we haven't seen much of an impact of biosimilars in Europe such as Procrit and we\u2019re not seen much of an impact for any other biosimilars as well including REMICADE.","In the U.S, you raise a question about the potential biosimilar impact in the U.S because of Celltrion filing. Just as a reminder, we have a patent in the U.S, which goes until 2018 and yes, it's true that the Patent Office recently issued a rejection to that patent, but we have recently filed a revised amendment to that, which is now in the public domain.","And until the patent in finally adjudicated, which could go up to the Supreme Court with the number of appellate arguments and appellate avenues that we have available to us. We don\u2019t expect that there will be a final adjudication of the patent for several years now.","So whether or not, the biosimilar comes to market in the face of that particular patent situation is up to the competitor. But we certainly continue to believe in the strength of our patents and the validity of those patents and we\u2019re in active discussions with the Patent Office and we will pursue all available appeals and all the available jurisdictions and avenues of jurisdiction that we have to us, which again, I would say, would take several years before they would be finally adjudicated.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up on your utilization comments, you\u2019ve called out the fact that we\u2019ve seen a couple of quarters of utilization pickup on the hospital side of things? Has that -- it didn't look like that really translated to pickup in your surgical sales and I was just wondering if that\u2019s result of -- that being obscured by pricing or some other fact and when will we expect to see some of that utilization pickup be reflected in your MD&D sales?","Dominic Caruso","Right. Well, couple of things, I remember, the MD&D sales, surgical care in particular have been impacted by lower women\u2019s health and urology sales. Remember, we withdrew the more selects product from the market. So there is some negative impact related to that. There was also some negative pricing pressure in the quarter. And the overall utilization uptick that we saw was in the very low single digit. So, I mentioned it was modest growth, although encouraging that we saw in two quarters in a row but still very modest, Derrick.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Dominic Caruso","","Welcome.","Louise Mehrotra","","Next question, please.","Operator","","The next question comes from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse.","Louise Mehrotra","Morning, Vamil.","","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Just couple on the diabetes side here with your SGLT2. Can you just comment what you are hearing from physicians around the differentiation for your product versus some of the competitors that are now in the market? And are you envisioning any tougher pricing dynamics going forward with that class given that there are competitors? And last on the combination with SGLT2 and DPP-4s, can you just remind us if you guys are working on that? I would think that would be good strategy to kind of maintain your position and your competitors certainly are working on those combinations.","Dominic Caruso","","Right. Well with respect to the differentiations of INVOKANA to the new competitors, INVOKANA, of course continues to do very well. And the data as you know as filed was a result of something like eight different clinical trials, which should both the safety and the efficacy of INVOKANA, seems to continue to do well even in the face of new competition. So, we\u2019re still growing share even with new competitors coming to the market. We don't see much of a price issue in the marketplace.","They are all relatively priced competitively. Remember, this is a very large market and the fact that more SGLT2 inhibitors come to market, we think is good for the market overall because it increases physician\u2019s awareness of the use of that particular mechanism of action. We think the market can withstand a number of competitors. And so we think overall there will be market growth as a result. As far as the combination, I\u2019m not aware that we are actually studying the combination with DPP2 and SGLT2 inhibitor combination.","Louise Mehrotra","","Yeah. So INVOKANA was just approved, right, which is combination with metformin. And if you look at the usage of INVOKANA, where about 50% of it is in triple therapies, so they are actually able to get the combination themselves.","Dominic Caruso","Right.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. One quick follow-up, if I could on this because the schizophrenia market, just the LAIs, the growth there was a little bit less than we anticipated. Can you just provide any color there on the deceleration in the U.S. and outside the U.S. this quarter?","Louise Mehrotra","I think for our business, the combined, still grew very well, if you take a look at our INVEGA SUSTENNA and Risperdal Consta together. So the U.S. is up 10% due to an increase in combined market share for our growth and that\u2019s INVEGA SUSTENNA and Risperdal Consta together. OUS is up about 3%, so worldwide it\u2019s six in operational levels.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","","Okay. Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to go back to orthopaedics, I was wondering, Louise, if you could just provide the pricing on trauma and then I have other questions?","","Louise Mehrotra","I think someone was going to ask that one. Okay, so for trauma, U.S. only prices 0.5, 0.7 negative and mix was very strong at 2.5% positive, so for net net, a roughly 2% positive.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then more strategically just thinking about the Medical Device business, I don't expect you to comment or rumors, but I guess there was some speculation that you guys maybe working where you saw some portions of the quarter\u2019s business. Can you maybe just tell us, Dominic, how you are thinking I guess more broadly about MD&D where you expressed an interest in cardiology more broadly, although have also said about comments on the growth rate there? But has anything changed just overall and the strategic value of having a more broad-based Medical Device business and maybe make some comments in that theme and just a consolidation that you are seeing in your competitors?","Dominic Caruso","Right. Kristen, thanks for the questions. So, couple of things, so nothing changed with respect to our overall strategic approach to the space. We are looking at areas where we think there will be strong market growth either because of demographics or because of innovation or because of our own ability to compete in the market, bringing in new technologies with our current presence.","As you know, we made the determination some time ago that we\u2019re going to focus on surgery, general surgery, and specialty surgery, and orthopedics and have less of a focus on cardiovascular and we got out of the drug-eluting stent business as we saw that become a commoditized business.","Within the overall approach to medical devices, we still believe surgery is the place to be. We\u2019re obviously very happy with our market position there. We made a big bet as you know in orthopedics and we\u2019re continuing to see the benefits of that combination with Synthes. And with respect to cardiology, we believe that there are specific areas of focus within cardiology that are important. And for example, electrophysiology where we\u2019re a leader there and we've seen very good growth, I think nearly 18% growth this quarter from our Biosense Webster business.","So nothing has really changed. We believe these are the two main areas within and indeed that we\u2019re going to focus on surgery and orthopedics with selective investments in selective growth areas within cardiovascular medicine. I think our competitors have basically followed suit in terms of these combinations in orthopedics as you know, and there is also combinations along with a current large player in cardiology now acquiring a major player in surgery, again confirming our approach that in fact surgery is the place that we\u2019re going to see sustainable growth going forward. So nothing has changed and I hope that overall picture that I gave you is consistent with the previous discussions we've had and we\u2019re moving along that strategy.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","And on the ortho side, we\u2019ve seen the special charges for Synthes continue for longer than I would have anticipated. When I guess will that business be fully integrated and then when will all the one-time charges that are more occurring I guess charges stop for that business? I\u2019ve just been surprised by the magnitude and by how long we\u2019ve been seeing that?","Dominic Caruso","Right. Well, we are very careful to integrate this business in a way that wouldn\u2019t be disruptive to our customers. And we made sure that that was our first priority. There is a number of sites that we have to consolidate. These are two very large businesses as you can imagine. So these integration activities are winding down and we should see less of the special charges going forward. And I would say that we\u2019re very close to actually completing the full integration of Synthes.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Right. Thanks very much.","Dominic Caruso","","You\u2019re welcome.","","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.","Louise Mehrotra","","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. First, Dominic for you, you mentioned a couple of headwinds for calendar year 2015. I think you said that if currency rates would stay the same, you would see about a $0.15 to $0.20 headwind, that's pretty clear. But OLYSIO, I just want to make sure I understand what the message is in terms of looking forward. Should we think about that as a significant EPS headwind in 2015? Or are you going to reduce the expenditures that you\u2019ve got running through in 2014 or 2015, such that that won\u2019t be a significant EPS headwind in 2015?","Dominic Caruso","Right. Well, one way to think about it is that OLYSIO has been a major contributor this year, but we, of course, invested, as I mentioned earlier, some of that upside in the business, so that overall next year when you see a reduction of that contribution overall net-net, it wouldn't be a significant as you might think and that's why, I quoted, the net $0.20 impact for the first nine months.","We don't believe that that given the dynamics in the marketplace of this significance that we should overreact and adjust our business too drastically just from one year to the next, considering the fact that we have many investment opportunities, the businesses are still growing nicely and in fact, the overall pharmaceutical business as you know even without OLYSIO is still growing at high double-digit rate. So we continue to bring our consumer products back to the marketplace.","So we don't want to really overreact from a big change in a single item that we believe the investment community is very well versed on and so we\u2019ll continue to invest in our businesses appropriately going forward.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay. I asked the question just because and I realize it's only one year, but there was couple of headwinds for next year that people are trying to get ahead of from a modeling perspective, so I just want to make sure do you understand all the moving parts?","The second question I want to ask was back on your utilization commentary, which did seem more constructive this quarter relative to last? And one thing you\u2019ve comment on the past is your suture business perhaps is a good indication of what's going on from a surgical procedure volume perspective? So I was just wondering if you think your suture business this quarter provided any insight into what's going on, I was just wondering if could just give us a sense as to how much that grew to this particular quarter?","Dominic Caruso","Right. So, we said, I mentioned earlier, we did see positive utilization trends two quarters in a row. So we have you two dots we can connect. I guess but these are very, very modest, very low single-digit utilization rate increases and our suture business also had modest low single-digit growth offset by a little bit of price, but overall modest growth. So I think that's consistent with utilization trends we have seen.","Louise Mehrotra","Yes. The best estimate from our surgical care group is that the market was flat in the U.S. and then as Dominic said, there\u2019s some negative price on it, and then internationally, sutures grew about 2%, so on a worldwide basis we grew 1.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dominic Caruso","You\u2019re welcome.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from a line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple, I think, most of the topics have been pretty well covered? But I did want to drill into a couple of comments on orthopedics? In particular you mentioned your estimates for market growth approximately 3% hips, 4% knees, and I realized that we are early about a third of the markets reported? But as you think about U.S. versus Europe, I guess, one of the things in an OUS is a little bit surprising to us is the strength that we've seen overseas? If you can maybe comment on the seasonally slow quarter, how we are seeing things like 6% operating growth for example in knees OUS, if you could highlight a little bit of what you are seeing and then I have one follow-up?","Dominic Caruso","Well, Matt, one of things that we are benefiting from is the launch of ATTUNE, our knee platform and it\u2019s been very well as it continued to launch throughout the world and we are seeing significant growth from the ATTUNE launch in Europe in particular, so that that's a major factor that\u2019s specific to our business and not the overall market.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","And then the other would be on sort of the share dynamic and I think about trauma and hips and knees coming together, we\u2019ve all been talking for a long time about the potential benefits of bundling? I am wondering whether you are growing a little bit faster than the market as you commented on, but is any of that coming in the form of either share ahead of some of the strategic or hypothetical strategic actions in this space or just benefits of having a broader bigger trauma, hip, knee offering in orthopedics?","Dominic Caruso","Yes. I do think that that we are seeing the benefit of having a broader offering in orthopedics. So we had estimated some sales synergy from combining these businesses and we just got a report recently from the team and we are ahead of the sales synergies that we had expected.","So I think the overall combination is working well for us. This is a marketplace as you know where share changes are not very dramatic and they are gradual overtime, but we are seeing positive momentum in that regard.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Nothing on the share gains related to sort of dissynergies or reps jumping ship from some of these other competitors?","Dominic Caruso","Well, I think, a little too early to tell that, but we do think that is an opportunity going forward. There will be disruption as we experienced ourselves when we combined our two spine businesses. So we think that will be an opportunity for us go -- on a go forward basis.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Welcome.","Louise Mehrotra","With respect to everyone\u2019s time, we will take two more questions. Next question please?","Operator","The next question is from line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Co.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Josh.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Josh.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.","Good morning. Good morning. Thanks a lot. Just wanted to follow-up on with an orthopedic question on the Ortho unit, you\u2019ve obviously established breadth and scale there. But just wanted to see if you would comment on where some of the weakness in the portfolio is, that\u2019s serving on as an anchor to the overall growth of the franchise? And then also, does J&J need a robotics platform for the recon and\/or spine business to compete effectively in the future?","Dominic Caruso","Well, let me just say that with respect to the second question, I don\u2019t think we need a robotics platform of our own to effectively compete in the future. We are in fact utilized in the robotic platform that exists today with our products, at the end of factor \u2013 end of the robotic arm. So we do participate in the robotic -- view it as a critical enabler of growth for us in particular.","And then, secondly, with respect to the overall orthopedics business, I would say, the only place we saw some softening is in trauma in the extremities portion of trauma. So, lower foot and ankle kind of trauma products, that market seem to be growing more rapidly than the overall market and we have some new innovations coming to market, but not yet there. So we are not yet participated in that growth, but we will be going forward.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Co.","Okay.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please? Next and last question, and then we\u2019ll turn it over to Dominic for some final remarks.","Operator","Your final question will be from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Thanks guys for squeezing me in here. Louise, just related to ZYTIGA, the U.S. growth rates were actually relatively strong but the international growth rates slowed a little bit, I know it was a very challenging comp outside the U.S. Could you just update us on any dynamics outside the U.S. for ZYTIGA? And then specifically in the U.S. maybe any insight you can give us on competitive share and key patient indications and how you are trending? Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra ","","Certainly, for the U.S. about 90% of our shares are going through the oncologist and about 10% -- 10%, 11% going through the urologist. In the third quarters, 60 plus percent was in the na\u00efve versus the refractory. And I think what you are seeing in outside the U.S. is just continued new introductions into the market.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Louise Mehrotra","","Okay.","Dominic Caruso","Very welcome.","Louise Mehrotra","Some final remarks from Dominic.","Dominic Caruso","","Okay. Well, thank you everybody for your thoughtful questions and I hope you will agree that our continued investments and innovations, and our strategic portfolio management are delivering very strong performance and positioning us well for growth moving forward. Well, we couldn\u2019t do that without the great people who work at Johnson & Johnson, I would like to thank them for all they do every day and the contributions they make on behalf of the consumers and patients whose lives we touch around the world every day. So thank you very much for joining us today and have a great day.","Operator","","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson, you may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning and welcome. I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2012. Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This call is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the investor relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.","I will begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the second quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will discuss his near term and strategic priorities for Johnson & Johnson. Following Alex\u2019s remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the second quarter financial results and discuss guidance for the full year of 2012. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was sent to the investment community earlier this morning is the schedule showing sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These are also available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release.","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2011 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.","Last item. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2012. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled supplementary sales data by geographic area. Worldwide sales to customers were $16.5 billion for the second quarter of 2012, down 0.7% as compared to the second quarter of 2011. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.5% and currency had a negative impact of 4.2%. On June 14, the acquisition of Synthes was completed and the related sales for the remaining 11 days in the quarter were included in the results.","Synthes contributed 1.2% to the worldwide operational sales growth. In the U.S. sales were down 1.2% impacted by generic competition for LEVAQUIN and CONCERTA, partially offset by the positive contribution from Synthes. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.1%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 7.5 points. The western hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 22.4% operationally, while Europe grew 1.6% operationally. The Asia Pacific, Africa region grew 7.7% on an operational basis.","The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made strong contribution to the results outside the U.S. Additionally, the amended agreement with Merck regarding REMICADE and SIMPONI had a significant impact on the very strong sales growth in the western hemisphere excluding the U.S. I will discuss these items in more detail in the segment commentary.","If you will now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. Net earnings were $1.4 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the same period in 2011. Earnings per share were $0.50 versus $1 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the accompanied table on non-GAAP measures, 2012 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after-tax non-cash charges primarily attributed to a partial write-down of in-process research and development and intangible assets related to the Crucell vaccines business, an increase to the reserve for previously disclosed civil litigation matters and transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Synthes Inc.","Second quarter 2011 net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact related to the restructuring of the cardio-vascular care business, the net impact of expenses related to litigation matter, additional DePuy ASR Hip recall costs, and a currency adjustment related to the acquisition of Synthes Inc. Excluding special items in both periods, second quarter 2012 net earnings on an adjusted basis of $3.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.30 were up 2.7%, and 1.6% respectively versus the second quarter of 2011. I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights.","For the second quarter of 2012, cost of goods sold at 31.2% was in line with the same period last year. Costs associated with the ongoing remediation in our OTC business were offset by the 2011 special charge related to the restructuring of the cardiovascular care business. Second quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses at 30.1% of sales were down 130 basis points due to cost containment initiatives across many of our businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.7%, 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the timing of expenditures.","Interest expense net of interest income of $129 million was up $18 million versus the second quarter of 2011 due to a higher average debt balance. Other expense net of other income of $2 billion in the second quarter of 2012 compared to $206 million in the same last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense was $174 million compared to $109 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.6% in the second quarter of 2012 versus 19.6% in the same period in 2011. Dominic will provide more commentary on both special items and taxes in his remarks.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the second quarter of 2012. I will begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide consumer segment sales for the second quarter of 2012 of $3.6 billion, decreased 4.6% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 0.6% while the impact of currency was negative 5.2% U.S. sales were down 1.9% while international sales grew 2% on an operational basis. Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 3.2% when compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to international sales of hair care and powders.","Sales in the oral care business increased 7.5% operationally due to strong sales outside the U.S. from newly launched LISTERINE products. For the second quarter of 2012, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 0.6% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2011 with U.S. sales up 1.8% and sales outside the U.S. flat on operational basis. Sales in the U.S. increased due to the re-launch of selected key products and the impact of the acquisition of full ownership rights to certain digestive health products.","McNeil-PPC is operating under a Consent Decree covering the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Fort Washington and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McNeil continues to operate the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras and Lancaster. As we previously discussed, production volumes from these facilities continue to be impacted by additional review and approval processes. We expect this to continue throughout 2012 and most of 2013. Plants operating under the Consent Decree will produce a simplified portfolio focused on key brands.","Our skincare business grew 2.2% on an operational basis in the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to strong sales of Neutrogena in the U.S. Women\u2019s health declined 8.7% on an operational basis, sales in the U.S. were down 33.9% while sales outside the U.S. were down 0.2% on an operational basis. The sales decline this quarter was primarily due to the impacted divestitures of certain brands as well as the sales impact last year of new product launches related to initial stocking. Wound care\/other sales decreased 3.7% on an operational basis compared to the same period last year due to competitive pressure. That completes our review of the consumer segment and I will now review highlights for the pharmaceuticals segment.","Worldwide net sales for the second quarter of $6.3 billion increased 0.9% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 5.1% with a negative currency impact of 4.2 points. Sales in the U.S. decreased 4.5%, while sales outside the U.S. increased from an operational basis by 15.5%. The loss of marketing exclusivity for LEVAQUIN in June last year, and the May 2011 supply and distribution agreement with Watson Laboratories, Inc. to distribute an authorized generic version of CONCERTA in the U.S. negatively impacted worldwide pharmaceutical operational sales growth by approximately 4 points and U.S. growth by approximately 7.5 points.","Positively impacting sales growth in the quarter were sales related to the impact of the amended agreement with Merck, partially offset by divestitures. As a reminder in the third quarter of 2011, as a result of the agreement reached with Merck, we began selling REMICADE and SIMPONI directly into certain international territories. We therefore recorded lower U.S. export sales related to those territories and higher international sales. Excluding the items mentioned, the underlying worldwide operational growth was approximately 8% with growth in the U.S. at approximately 10%, and outside the U.S. at approximately 6% operational.","Now reviewing sales for the major therapeutic areas. Immunology products achieved strong double-digit operational sales growth of 18.2%. Sales in the U.S. declined 3.5% impacted by lower export sales to Merck as I just mentioned. Excluding the change in export sales, U.S. immunology sales increased nearly 11% led by STELARA, up 52% and REMICADE, up 6.5%. With these strong results, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. International sales of immunology products more than tripled versus the second quarter of 2011 due primarily to the sales related to the territories we regained from Merck.","Sales of infectious disease products increased 1.3% on an operational basis. Excluding the generic impact of LEVAQUIN which I previously mentioned, infectious disease sales increased over 20%. Major contributors were the successful launch of INCIVO for hepatitis C, the continued momentum in market share growth of PREZISTA and INTELENCE for HIV, partially offset by lower sales of vaccines primarily due to a supply disruption at our third party supplier. INCIVO contributed about 3.5 points to the growth of the total international pharmaceutical sales results.","On a sequential basis, sales were down primarily due to some seasonality in treatment patterns in Europe. Neuroscience products sales increased 0.5% on an operational basis. Growth was impacted by generic competition with CONCERTA as I mentioned, as well as products such as DURAGESIC, RAZADYNE and RISPERDAL. The long-acting injectable antipsychotic RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved operational growth of close to 20% due to an increase in combined market share. INVEGA sales outside the U.S. achieved operational growth of over 30% primarily due to the strong growth in Japan.","Sales of oncology products increased 14.1% on an operational basis due to the very strong results for ZYTIGA, partially offset by lower sales of DOXIL\/CAELYX related to manufacturing issues at our third-party supplier. ZYTIGA is currently approved to treat chemo-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved sales of over $230 million. On a sequential basis, reported sales increased approximately 15%. VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma, for which we have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world outside the U.S. Operational sales were flat due to the timing of tender business as referenced in my first quarter remarks. On a year-to-date basis, sales increased 13.4% operationally.","DOXIL\/CAELYX declined nearly 90% on an operational basis in the quarter. Restoring a reliable supply of DOXIL\/CAELYX remains our most urgent priority and we will continue to pursue a variety of options to bring a consistent supply of this important medication back to patients and physicians as quickly as possible. We anticipate being able to begin resupplying DOXIL\/CAELYX to the market in the fourth quarter of 2012. Note that in some markets health authority approvals will be required. Other pharmaceutical products declined 5.3% on an operational basis due to divestitures and lower sales of PROCRIT due to the decline in the market, and EPREX due primarily to the impact of generic competition.","Positively impacting results XARELTO sales grew 80% on a sequential basis, contributing approximately 1.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. As an update on XARELTO, first from a commercial perspective, XARELTO continues to make positive gains and access with over 90% coverage on commercial formularies. Half at a preferred branded status. Based on recent IMS data for the oral anti-coagulant market, XARELTO now exceeds Pradaxa in [new brands] scripts overall, and has captured nearly a third of the [new brands] scripts in cardiology, topping Pradaxa\u2019s share.","On the pipeline front, on July 9 we announced that the FDA assigned a priority reviewed designation to the supplemental new drug applications for XARELTO, seeking new indications to treat patients with deep vein thrombosis or DVT, pulmonary embolism or PE, and to prevent recurring venous thrombo embolism. In addition we also announced that we withdrew the sNDA for the use of XARELTO to reduce the risk of stem-thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome or ACS. This sNDA is contingent on a separate sNDA for XARELTO to reduce the risk of secondary cardiovascular events in patients with ACS, for which we received a complete response letter from the FDA.","We are confident in the robust study results and the positive benefit risk profile of XARELTO in patients with ACS, and we will continue to work the FDA to fully address their questions as quickly as possible. We plan to resubmit the sNDA for stem-thrombosis at the same time we submit our reply to the complete response for the ACS indication. Regarding Bapineuzumab, the two Johnson & Johnson led phase 3 studies are complete and we are currently gathering the data for analysis. The top line results will be available this quarter and are partner Pfizer has indicated they will be issuing a top line results press release.","The first presentation of the results will be a late breaker presentation of the European Federation of Neurological Societies Congress in Stockholm in September. Also during the quarter, the application for an additional indication for VELCADE for the treatment of patients with relapse follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was withdrawn after the CHMP indicated the data provided did not support a positive benefit risk balance. In addition the CHMP granted a positive opinion recommending approval of subcutaneous administration of VELCADE for the treatment of multiple myeloma. And just yesterday, we announced the filing in both the U.S. and Europe for SIMPONI, for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.","That completes the review of the pharmaceutical segment I will now review the medical devices and diagnostics segment results. Worldwide medical devices and diagnostics segment sales of $6.6 billion grew 3.4% operationally as compared to the same period in 2011. Currency had a negative impact of 3.5 points resulting in a total sales decrease of 0.1%. Sales excluding the impact of Synthes, were up 0.5% on an operational basis, with U.S. sales down 0.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 1.5% on an operational basis. The exit from the drug eluting stent market negatively impacted the worldwide MD&D sales growth by approximately 1%.","Now turning to the MD&D businesses starting with cardiovascular care. Cardiovascular care sales were down 10.9% operationally with the U.S. down 7.1% and sales outside the U.S. down 13.1% operationally. Excluding the impact of drug eluting stents, sales were down approximately 1% in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. Endovascular sales were negatively impacted by competitive launches and a disruption in supply that is expected to be resolved in the third quarter. Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved worldwide operational growth of 16% in the quarter. Disposable utilizations due to the breadth of the installed base of CARTO 3, complemented by the success of the new THERMOCOOL catheter launches made strong contributions to the results.","The diabetes care business achieved operational sales growth of 2.9% in the second quarter of 2012 with the U.S. business up 1.2%. Continued softness in mail-order sales and an inventory contraction at the retail level, impacted growth this quarter. The business outside the U.S. grew 4.6% operationally due to strong sales results in emerging markets, partially offset by lower sales of some of the developed markets. The diagnostics business declined 3.8% on an operational basis with the U.S. down 8.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 0.8% operationally in the second quarter. In the U.S., sales were impacted by lower donor screening sales due to competitive pressure.","General surgery worldwide sales grew operationally by 0.9% with the U.S. down 3.1% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.1% operationally. The success of new product launches, SECURESTRAP, PHYSIOMESH and the ECHELON FLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler, were partially offset by lower sales of mechanical products due to the continued shift to minimally invasive procedures and low-cost competition. Additionally in the U.S., lower sales of pelvic floor repair products as well as competition with trocars negatively impacted sales growth this quarter.","Infection prevention grew 2.3% on an operational basis with U.S. growth at 1% and growth outside the U.S. of 3.3% on an operational basis. A customer program to upgrade systems to STERRAD Solutions ended in the first quarter, impacting the timing of capital purchases for the year. Excluding capital sales, operational growth was approximately 11% in the quarter. Orthopedic sales were up 14% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding Synthes, sales grew 0.9% on an operational basis with the U.S. down 0.6% due to the divestiture in December 2011 of certain neurosurgical instruments. Sales outside the U.S. were up 2.6% excluding the impact of Synthes.","Operationally, hips were up 4% worldwide driven by 5% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. grew 3% operationally attributed to heads, cementless stems and acetabular products. Knees worldwide increased 3% on an operational basis, with similar results in both U.S. and outside the U.S. Worldwide spine was down 3% on an operational basis with the U.S. down 5% due to continued pressure on price. Sales outside the U.S. were up 1% operationally with strong results in emerging markets partially offset by competitive and pricing pressure in certain developed markets.","Specialty surgery achieved operational growth of 7.8% in the second quarter of 2012, with the U.S. sales up 8% and sales outside the U.S. up 7.6% on an operational basis. Incremental sales from the acquisition of SterilMed and strong international sales of biosurgery products and energy products were the major drivers of growth this quarter. Rounding out the review of the medical devices & diagnostics segment, our vision care business achieved operational sales growth of 1.9% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 3.3%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 1.2% on an operational basis. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses.","That completes highlights for the medical devices & diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2012. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Louise, and thanks to all of you for participating on the call today. You know it\u2019s a real pleasure for me to join you, this being the first earnings announcement since I have assumed my responsibility as the CEO. This kind of dialogue with the investment community is something I consider important and mutually valuable. During the past couple of months I have done a lot of travelling and a lot of listening. This has allowed me to refine my understanding of the many opportunities we have across Johnson & Johnson and our plans to capitalize on them in the future. So I would like to spent a few minutes right upfront conveying my excitement for the future of Johnson & Johnson, and give you a sense of our priorities.","Nothing is more important than the health and well being of those we care about. That\u2019s why the Johnson & Johnson family of companies for more than 125 years has committed itself to caring for patients and consumers. Going forward, we will build on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s long, proud legacy of strong performance, trust, esteem, high reputation and many accomplishments. Our commitment, a legacy of our founders and a very real motivating force among our 128,000 employees, is embodied in our credo which speaks to our first responsibility to the doctors, nurses, patients, the mothers and fathers and all who use our products. I am resolute in my determination to keep our credo as the foundation of Johnson & Johnson.","Our credo has long been and must continue to be the defining feature of our organization because it reflects our core value systems, our beliefs and our aspirations. Science will evolve, our environment markets will change, but who we are and what we believe as described so well by our credo, will ensure we successfully navigate through whatever the future has to offer. Help people around the world achieve good health is likely to be the most significant challenge and opportunity for our entire generation. Because of that we must be bold, thoughtful and disciplined as we help shape the future of human health and well-being. Along so many dimensions the global healthcare environment is changing dramatically. From the broad demographic changes associated with an ageing world, the need for healthcare access among developing markets, the healthcare funding challenges faced by almost every government. From higher levels of regulatory vigilance to changes in healthcare technologies, to consumers increasingly defining their pass to health all of these occurrence and counter occurrence brings tremendous opportunity and potential risk to healthcare companies. ","Addressing this web of challenges and opportunities is where Johnson & Johnson truly shines. Not simply because of our innovations but because of our dedications to the core strategic principles and values we had in place for so many years, combined with a real sense of commitment to building even stronger business and organization for the future. ","Our leadership team is fully aware of the market needs, dynamics, expectations and capabilities are evolving and we must change and adapt of the high sense of urgency as move into the future. Let\u2019s briefly consider our four strategic principles; first, we will remain committed to being broadly based in human healthcare, we believe our broad day (inaudible) in terms of business strategy, product development and talent development. It gives us access to a wide range of markets and makes us more agile and adapting to change and grasping opportunity. ","Customers, technology and financial incentives will continue to change in healthcare, yes through our broad based we can remain disciplined about exactly where in healthcare we will focus our efforts and resources. Customers are increasingly aggregating their purchasing decisions looking for new partnership. They are focusing on solutions and outcomes that span beyond individual products. With our comprehensive portfolio, we are in an excellent position to shape this trend and to provide a comprehensive partnership across the broad array of customer needs, technologies and capabilities. ","We know that our broad based in healthcare is particularly helpful in emerging and developing markets where Johnson & Johnson\u2019s equity and critical mass position us well with customers and government. In addition, we believe that convergent technology such as diagnostics, biomarkers and combined drug device therapeutics will better enable us to provide differentiated, sustainable, competitive advantage for the future. Some of these combination markets are growing in double-digit rates much faster than other segments of healthcare. We have a wide range of technology, clinical development, regulatory, supply chain, quality and commercial capabilities to address these opportunities. In Johnson & Johnson, our broad portfolio of innovative resources and capabilities offer significant potential to bring complex and innovative technologies to patients and consumers. ","As a second principle, we remain committed to being decentralized in those areas that are closest to serving patients and our customers. I\u2019d like to refer this is inline in decentralization because not everything about Johnson & Johnson is decentralized nor should it be. We have taken significant strive to standardize many of our support systems and processes and it realize efficiencies and improved effectiveness as a result. At the same time, we want to ensure that local needs inside and entrepreneurship drive our commercial efforts, like our broad based of products, decentralization increases our agility by offering local windows in the so many diverse markets. ","Third, we will remain committed our philosophy of managing for the long-term. But this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have short-term pressures and obligations, but managing with a view for long-term, sustainable gains, is in our view thus for the interest of our patients, customers, employees and shareholders. In fact, our diversification of broad based has allowed us to keep our strategic focus even in the face of short-term challenges in portions of our business. This allows Johnson & Johnson to invest in long-term value creation and not be constrained by short-term issues requiring short-term choices. ","Our expansive view gives us flexibility, perspective, and a wherewithal to manage through a myriad of time reducing risk while still achieving solid returns. For instance as a pharmaceutical segment experienced the height of its patent losses from 2007 to 2009, our disciplined approach still enable rigorous prioritization and continued investment in our pharmaceutical R&D pipeline. This help could be well positioned for long-term growth and has led to our having one of the strongest new product portfolios in the industry today.","During our capital allocation process, a review of optimal reinvestment rate is evaluated for each business. This ensures that the best growth opportunities are realized. I can assure you that we will work aggressively as a management team going forward to apply this assessment rigorously and in a consistent and systematic manner. We recognized that it will be critical for us to exit or significantly revamp areas of our business where we no longer feel we can help patients and consumer or we can no longer drive positive shareholder returns. ","Our decisions to exit the drug eluding stent market (inaudible) and the purchase of these are good examples of the kind of discipline we use in making strategic choices on where and when to invest and divest. ","Finally, we have always had a core strategic principle of focusing on our people and our cradle value to ensure our success for the long-term. Markets and products will fluctuate, new challenges and opportunities will be evolving, but in the long-term our people and values will truly make a difference. ","These four strategic principles are as relevant today as they have ever been. They are the solid foundation from which our growth is built. Before I talk about our specific growth drivers, let me briefly describe three short-term priorities that we have identified. We recognized that we must [track these] as focus and vigor as an enterprise. ","The three are; first, through a store supply of our McNeil over-the-counter products to the market. Second, to build on the momentum of our pharmaceutical business and finally, to successfully integrate the Synthes acquisition and create the unparallel world leader in orthopedic and neurologics. One of my highest priorities is to restore reliable supply of high quality over-the-counter products to the marketplace and to do what it takes to continue to build trust in our products and brand. Right now, that means successfully meeting two commitments; first, meeting our obligations with respect to the consent to create our McNeil plants and second meeting our commitment to return OTC products to consumers as quickly as possible. ","It has been just over a year I\u2019m signing a consent to create with the FDA. Since that time we worried more about the complexity of implementing and operating under the consent decree and the skills and capabilities required across our organization to perform this critical work. we will continue to deliver on our consent decree commitment while ensuring quality and continuing to remediate facilities and processes. We will pace production accordingly at those plants taking a prudent approach to production volumes and focusing on delivering a consistent supply of select products. During this period, we will ensure our operational and organizational models are appropriate for the business. At the same time we will bring an additional resources as needed and continue to evaluate other options for returning these great product to consumers. ","Over the longer term, we are committed to and remain optimistic about the future of our OTC business. We are laying the ground work for an OTC business focused on meaningful, science based innovation delivering high quality and reliable products and surpassing consumer expectations. Meanwhile, we also believe we have a number of significant growth opportunities in our skin care, oral care and base consumer segments. I look forward to updating you further on our progress overtime.","Second, we are extremely proud the success of our pharmaceutical teams and bringing to market such an impressive array of new therapies in recent months. Now our teams are focused on building on this momentum along multiple fronts, by growing our core business globally, to accelerated growth in our new products and by continuing to build our pipeline. ","Our core products such as REMICADE and PREZISTA continue to be drivers of growth. Meanwhile, with successful launch results for products like ZYTIGA, INCIVO, XARELTO, STELARA, SIMPONI, INVEGA, SUSTENNA, Johnson & Johnson led the U.S. and Europe in new pharmaceutical products sales in 2011 according to IMS and we see continued momentum this year. Also over the past several months we made additional progress for the number of important filings; U.S. and EU filings for canagliflozin for type-2 diabetes; ZYTIGA for chemo na\u00efve indication for prostate cancer in the U.S. and EU; XARELTO for VTE treatment in the U.S.; TMC 207 for multi-drug resistant TB in the U.S. ","We have also made progress on a number of key clinical trials, in short our pharmaceutical business is poised and resourced to continue to be a strong driver of sales momentum. We will continue to build our pipeline through organic development, partnerships and alliances focused on significant unmet medical needs. ","Finally, we will successfully integrate Synthes into the few family of companies. As you know we successfully closed the Synthes acquisition this quarter and we are pleased with our progress. We are delighted to have been able to retain Michel Orsinger as part of the strong leadership team to direct this business now called the few Synthes companies. ","We are positioned as a market leader and $40 billion and growing market where we have an approximately 25% share, and we are number one, two or three in those specialties. We are the largest, most innovative and comprehensive orthopedic and neurological business in the world. Our integration work is well underway our regional and functional leaders represent a combination of talent from both DePuy and Synthes. We have already organized a combined sales force of in-house and contract resources. Meanwhile, our manufacturing, marketing and other functional teams are actively at work on implementation of their integration plans. ","Turning from our short-term focus areas over longer term, we have identified four key drivers of growth for Johnson & Johnson, building value through innovation, expanding our global reach, excellence in execution and leading with a purpose. We will be focused on accelerating growth in both top and bottom lines, being even more disciplined and decisive in making strategic calls. In this context, meaningful innovation will be more crucial than ever to driving growth. ","We must aggressively gather customer driven insights and from these generate identify and develop new treatment and prevention approaches. These approaches must be ones that will make a meaningful difference in healthcare and extend access in economical and sustainable ways to improve the wide expectations in customers. ","Innovation at J&J is more than products and pipeline, it's about bringing innovation to everything we do. It is everyone\u2019s responsibility. One quarter, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s revenue and growing comes from products introduced within the past five years. So, Johnson & Johnson will remain a leader in research and development, we are also focused on being innovative and how we bring products to market. The kinds of partnerships we develop and how we operate our businesses. ","We are the forefront of driving innovation through diverse models, for example, we are broadening our scope to cross sector innovation centers. We recognized a transforming healthcare and delivering holistic outcomes require that we capture and fuel the best science and technology from all over the world and across all segments. ","Our innovation centers bring resources together and the leading innovation hot spots around the world, giving us greater access to the most promising science and technology and increased ability to the shape the healthcare landscape. ","And second area of focus for growth is a need to expand our reach globally while maintaining our local focus on implementation. That combination has made us effective in the 55% of our business, that is already outside the United States. We operate in 60 countries and touch more than 1 billion patients and customers around the world. But helping the next billion people will not be so easy. Many live in the developing world and have very different needs than our traditional customers. Income levels were growing rapidly or lower, unmet healthcare needs are abound, indeed demand for healthcare in these markets is growing 3 or 4 times faster than developed markets. ","We continue to see double-digit year-over-year sales growth in our BRIC markets. In this new world our focus will be on expanding our footprint to help more people and on delivering healthcare in economical and sustainable ways. In medical devices for example, our engineers are adapting and refining products from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s outstanding portfolio to make medical devices to better suit the conditions and needs of Asia\u2019s healthcare professionals and patients. ","A number of products for the emerging markets have already been developed and launched including such products as the Ethicon ENDO surgery, reusable linear cutter, the Synsyl suture range for Ethicon, the DePuy REACH knee and one-touch simple select blood glucose monitor. In our consumer space we are seeing unique offerings like a new line of body wash products from our DePuy business in China, (inaudible) across Asia and a value [price with serene] formulation targeted young professionals in Brazil. ","Around the world we are also pioneering market appropriate public private partnerships, a couple of weeks ago while visiting our businesses in Russia, I saw firsthand remarkable work we are doing in partnerships there the range from producing our market leading Velcade product locally to training and medical education to partnering on biotechnology research. ","To reach billions of customers and patients, our best strategies and plan must always be paired with excellence and execution. That is our third growth driver. High standards and high quality must always be our starting point. Nowhere is the need for flawless execution more imperative than it is in healthcare. About 2.5 years ago we began to integrate our supply chain operations that simplify processes and ensure more consistent quality across our business units. We are already seeing evidence of excellent progress including the establishment of global quality standards. We will focus on applying the same type of rigor through execution across our enterprise to our commercial plants, our launches and our clinical trial processes to name a few. Our strategies, business plans, organizational structures and ongoing decisions all recognize the need to focus resolutely then execute with excellence.","Finally, in driving growth, we count on our leaders to lead with a purpose in all that they do. Our leaders distinguish us from other companies. They exhibit passion and autonomy in meeting the existing needs of their patients and customers and identifying unmet needs and in being able to marshal resources to address these needs efficiently and effectively. We are focused on how we bring innovations to market that can have the greatest impact on human healthcare. Very simply, our success in this depends on having responsible people, employees with the skills, judgment, integrity and leadership qualities to build our future. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our employees at Johnson & Johnson. They are associates and colleagues who take this responsibility very seriously. From both internal and external studies, we see convincing evidence that our employees uniquely appreciate our values and strategies and help position us well for sustainable growth. ","With our clear strategic principles and focus on high priority growth drivers, I\u2019m enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for Johnson & Johnson. We make a difference for over a billion people around the world every day. We aspire to help additional billions of people live longer, healthier, happier lives. There\u2019s no better company anywhere to pursue this aspiration than Johnson & Johnson.","Now let me turn the call over to Dominic before we open up for Q&A.","Dominic Caruso ","Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some comments this morning about our second quarter financial results, discuss briefly the Synthes transaction, and provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2012."," ","Our second quarter performance was solid despite the continuing marketplace and economic pressures. Although healthcare utilization trends are still below prerecession levels, we saw continuing stabilization of the trends based on first quarter data with some signs of improvement in the rate of growth in hospital admissions and surgeries, including joint replacement. But while positive, these signs are still too early and minor to single any meaningful sustained recovery especially in light of the continued uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment.","Sales results for the quarter were impacted significantly by the weakening euro but were positively enhanced by the closing of the Synthes transaction. Second quarter sales on an operational basis excluding the impact of currency grew at 3.5%. With two weeks of sales related to the completion of the Synthes acquisition contributed just over 1% to the operational growth for this quarter. From an earnings perspective earnings per share excluding special items were $1.30.","Louise provided some information already regarding the special items we recorded in the second quarter. Let me take a few minutes now to provide some additional background regarding those items. ","First, regarding Crucell, as many of you remember historically the rules for acquired in-process research and development or IPR&D require that such cost be expensed at the time of acquisition. In 2009, however, the accounting rules changed to require that acquired in-process research and development be capitalized as an asset. Periodic evaluations for changes in the status of the related research projects are performed as the research projects progress.","In the second quarter the company recorded as a special item an after-tax charge of approximately $800 million regarding Crucell. This charge relates to changes in the timelines for the development projects included in the original capitalized amount as well as a reduction in the carrying value of intangible assets related to currently marketed products that have been impacted by pricing and competitive pressures. ","In terms of the balance of the Crucell business there are several other projects in the Crucell R&D pipeline such as a vaccine for HIV and another vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus which are advancing well. However, current accounting rules for IPR&D do not permit any increases in the values of programs post acquisition. We continue to believe in the importance of Crucell in delivering innovative healthcare solutions to patients around the world. Additionally, during the quarter we also recorded after-tax charges for adjustments to the carrying value of other intangible assets and those have been reflected as special items as well.","Next turning to litigation matters. As we discussed several weeks ago the company incurred special charge in the second quarter of approximately $600 million after-tax to increase its reserve for previously disclosed civil litigation matters related to RISPERDAL, INVEGA, NATRECOR and Omnicare.","And finally, in connection with the closing of the Synthes transaction we incurred after-tax charges of approximately $550 million including integration and transaction costs. We also expect that for the remainder of the year we will incur additional special items representing after-tax charges of approximately $600 million related to the further transaction, integration and restructuring cost as well as cost associated with the step-up of inventory values.","Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss the completion of the Synthes transaction. As we have been forecasting since last year we completed the acquisition in the second quarter and we are very pleased to have achieved this milestone. And as we have reported we expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings by $0.03 to $0.05 for 2012 and $0.10 to $0.15 for 2013. These estimates include the impact of approximately $400 million after-tax on an annualized basis of incremental amortization expense related to the transaction. Many of you have asked about the financing structure we used to execute the transaction. It is important to note that the facts and circumstances for the financing structure are very specific to Johnson & Johnson and we have described the financing structure in the press release and related 8-K filing. We will not be providing any additional information about the financing structure as this would entail disclosing information which we consider confidential and competitive about our operations. As Alex indicated in his comments, we are moving ahead with the integration efforts and we are delighted to have Synthes join the Johnson & Johnson family of companies.","Let me now provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2012. My guidance now includes the positive impact from the acquisition of Synthes, the divestiture of our worldwide DePuy trauma business to Biomet as well as updated estimates for our consumer business, including OTC resupply timing, the impact of supply disruptions for certain of our MD&D businesses and recent updates to our vaccine business.","Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the second quarter we had approximately $700 million of net debt. This consists of approximately $16.9 billion of cash and investments and approximately $17.6 billion of debt. The reduction in our net cash position by approximately $15 billion since the end of the first quarter is of course mostly due to the acquisition of Synthes. We are very pleased that all three major rating agencies maintained our AAA credit rating and Moody\u2019s revised its outlook to stable from negative, following a transaction owing to our ongoing financial strength. For purposes of your models, assuming no additional major acquisitions during 2012 I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between 500 and $550 million consistent with our previous guidance.","Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation and divestitures, asset sales, or write-offs. ","This account is difficult to forecast. But assuming no additional major one-time gains or losses and excluding the impact of any special items, I\u2019d recommend you consider modeling other income and expense for 2012 as a net gain ranging from approximately 900 million to $1 billion consistent with our previous guidance.","And now a word on taxes. For the first six months of 2012, the company\u2019s effective tax rate excluding special items was 22.2%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2012 in the range of 21 to 22% consistent with our previous guidance. Although, not yet reflected in our first half results, this annual tax rate assumes that the R&D tax credit will be reinstated by Congress by the end of this year. And as always we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon the rate throughout the year.","Now let\u2019s turn to sales and earnings guidance. Our guidance continues to be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations assuming that average currency rates for 2012 will be the same as they were for 2011. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this operational view provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also continue to provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2012 with the impact that current exchange rates could have using the euro as an example.","Turning to sales. As a reminder our guidance now includes the positive impact from the acquisition of Synthes, the divestiture of our worldwide DePuy trauma business to Biomet as well as updated estimates for our consumer businesses including OTC resupplied timing, impact of supply disruptions for certain of our MD&D businesses and recent updates for our vaccine business. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between approximately 5.5% and 6.5% for the year. This would result in estimated sales for 2012 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $68.6 billion and $69.3 billion. ","While we\u2019re not predicting the impact of currency movements to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2012 were to stay where they were as of last week. As an example with the euro at approximately $1.23, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 3% for the year. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between 2.5 and 3.5% for the year for an expected level of reported sales of between approximately 66.7 and $67.3 billion.","And now turning to earnings. I suggest that you consider full-year 2012 operational EPS estimates of between $5.25 and $5.32 per share excluding the impact of special items and now including the accretive impact of the Synthes acquisition and assuming the same average exchange rates for 2012 as we saw in 2011. ","The impact of currency movements will be more significant on our earnings than on our sales. As the proportion of our earnings based on the euro currency are nearly two times the proportion of our sales based on the euro currency. ","While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if the currency exchange rates particularly the euro for the balance of 2012 were to remain where they were as of last week, then the impact of currency movements would be a reduction of approximately $0.25 per share or an incremental $0.14 per share from our previous guidance. Therefore, our reported earnings per share excluding special items would be between $5 and $5.07 per share, which is lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the accretive impact of the Synthes acquisition more than offset by the weakening of foreign exchange rates primarily the euro versus the U.S. dollar.","On a final note, I\u2019d like to point out that as you update your models for the guidance we provided, you should see pre-tax operating margins improve between 100 and 150 basis points, even with the incremental amortization expense related to Synthes. This is consistent with the financial discipline we continuously employ at our business while at the same time investing appropriately for sustainable growth.","That concludes my comments on our operating performance this quarter and our guidance with respect to your models and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. ","Now, Louise, back to you for the Q&A.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. Before we open the Q&A session, I\u2019d please ask you to keep your questions at the strategic level because we have Alex with us today. Felicia, could you give the instructions for the Q&A please?","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Alex, you talked about a bunch of items in your prepared comments and I think probably the one that I think people should focus on and probably got our attention was your comments about. The goal of accelerating J&J\u2019s sales and earnings growth, over the next several years not necessarily a short-term goal but a longer-term goal and within that you talked about innovation, globalization and other initiatives to try and accomplish that. Can you just talk a little about the portfolio today in that context, you talked about being more disciplined on strategic decisions regarding what goes into the portfolio and what comes out. Do you have the portfolio and do you have the R&D pipeline say to drive that acceleration and what do you think you need to do strategically to make that growth acceleration happen?","Alex Gorsky","As I commented earlier in my comments, I think overall, we believe that our diversified portfolio does better position us for the healthcare market that we are likely to experience ahead. Let\u2019s start with our pharmaceutical group, I believe the transformation that has occurred over the past several years when you consider the fact that we went through a very significant period of generic entries and patent expirations and you look at not only the fact the major changes that we made in our organization. But also if you look at the focus that Paul, Joaquin and their teams have put on specific therapeutic areas and frankly the success rates that we have had with our clinical development programs in getting new products to the market, we think it's really significant and has positioned us very well. ","We think by being focused in these areas not only does it give us an advantage in terms of our scientific insights in clinical development but it also enables us to leverage our commercial organization and really be focused on the right customers. So while we are very pleased with the uptick that we are seeing across that portfolio right now, with products like ZYTIGA, XARELTO, INCIVO, STELARA and SIMPONI. We\u2019re also investing for the future and we\u2019re excited about some of the new compounds that we have whether it's canagliflozin, bapineuzumab, things further out such as ibrutinib as well as TMC 435. And we\u2019re continuing to invest even longer term as you heard in our announcement this week with our new cyclic peptide in heart failure recognizing that its earlier. So, I think there we got a strong portfolio of very differentiated drugs that the market's demanding, but clearly we're also investing for the future. ","Now if I can step over to our MD&D space next, I think what I would say is, we're also positioning ourselves for what we believe are going to be the needs, the demands of the future environment. Specifically, it requires innovation and that's both in terms of products as well as the way that we're offering products to that marketplace. I think some of the recent moves that we've made with Synthes for example, creating the world's largest orthopedics platform, whether it's in reconstruction with hips and knees, spine, Sports Medicine, the emerging neurologics, obviously working now with trauma, and the Maxillofacial group coming in from Synthes. It's going to give us a breadth and depth to work with customers both in the United States as well as abroad on a very broad scale, bringing not only a broad array of products, but also other services and solutions that we think are going to be expected by hospitals and other payors in that particular environment. ","We have also made changes in our surgery group, if you look at what we have done over the past couple of quarters by bringing Ethicon or Ethicon Endo-Surgery group and our renewed portfolio and our Cardiovascular group together. There too we think we are not only offering them a very differentiated pipeline particularly with biosurgicals, our energy instruments, but we\u2019re also bringing a more competitive commercial model to bear that we think will bear fruits in the short-term as well as long-term. ","And finally, in our consumer group, we are clearly focused on remediation of our OTC business. That\u2019s been a very clear priority that we set for the organization and we\u2019re continuing to make strides, although we realize that it does present challenges and that there are learning\u2019s along the way. What we have seen frankly is we do get products back on the shelf that consumers demanded and so we will get the consent decree remediation completed. And we\u2019re very optimistic about the brands going forward, particularly when you look at our skin care line, you look at our baby care line, overall they are doing well, our oral care line also. So, we think that all of our segments of our business have good in line opportunities, we think there\u2019s exciting opportunities coming in each of their pipelines. But we also realize that given some of the changes in the market that we\u2019re likely going to have to be even more disciplined, more selective and decisive going forward. ","And I think evidence of that is the decision that we made in the drug eluting stent market that we alluded to earlier, we think that was the right call and by the way, Louise mentioned earlier, if you look at what we\u2019re doing with the Biosense Webster right now and the progress that we\u2019re making we are pleased with that, we\u2019re putting investments in other areas of our business. If you look at the investment with Synthes there too we\u2019re very optimistic based upon the work that we have seen through the integration so far. So, that would be my response to your question, Mike. Thank you.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Let me just take one quick follow-up with Dominic and maybe just to clarify a couple of items. One, Dominic, you referenced in your comments supply disruptions in certain of your MD&D businesses, I don\u2019t think I caught that earlier in your prepared remarks so could you just identify where those are occurring? And then second, Dominic, if we look at the operational EPS guidance my numbers had on the last call, your guidance for the year was $5.18 to $5.28 ex-currency and today you said $5.25 to $5.32 ex-currency, did I get that right?","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Let me take the last one first. You are exactly right. Our previous ex-currency guidance was $5.18 to $5.28. We increased the guidance to $5.25 to $5.32. Two things have happened there, we have added Synthes which we described as $0.03 to $0.05, so obviously the upper end of the range is up about $0.04. And we tightened the range a little bit because at this stage and again, we feel more comfortable with our earnings for the balance of the year. With respect to supply disruption, I\u2019ll ask Alex, if he wants to add some additional comments. Two areas in particular in our energy business, we have had some supply disruptions and in our endovascular business with respect to endovascular stents. Alex, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any more to that?","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Mike. We had two supply interruptions again in our energy and in our cardiovascular stents. We are in the process of resolving those as we speak and we are confident that in the back end of this year we will see that return to a normal flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Alex, I guess first for you. If you look at where Europe is heading, I think Europe, you were flat when you take out Synthes roughly. Looks like it's a little worse than it's been. Where do we think we are today and can you align the costs with some of the pressures you are seeing in Europe?","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Matt. Matt are you talking across the portfolio or in a specific segment?","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Well, I think the overall looked flat. I was wondering if any segments you\u2019re being hurt more than others in Europe broadly as well?","Alex Gorsky","Yes. Matt, your observation is right that overall I think we are up about 1.5% and again there is puts and takes across that. But what we are seeing is obviously some additional pressure with price as well as volumes and price being regulated mostly to tendering and some of the contract things that we would see in our pharmaceutical group. What we are seeing is consistent with around 2011 with perhaps slightly more in Southern Europe. If you look at MD&D, we are also seeing pressures, some in price, but some just in extended queues, longer wait times for certain procedures. So we are watching it very closely. We have not seen a dramatic change over what we saw in 2011, but obviously we still think that there are a lot of macroeconomic conditions and dynamics that may impact that going forward.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","And pharma on the pricing side has that also been more of an impact?","Alex Gorsky","Again, we are seeing some impact in pharma on the pricing side mostly related to tenders and other austerity measures, but not to a significantly greater degree than what we have commented around 2011 so far this year.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Dominic, one quick one for you. When you look at the operating margin leverage both this quarter and the back half, can you roughly say how much of that might be due to local currency in the lower cost from the FX as an offset to the top line?","Dominic Caruso","Yes, I think that one of the things that bear in mind is, we typically hedge our foreign currency commitments at about 18 months. So, our operations ex-translation, are not significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency, Matt. So, really what you're looking at is sort of a reasonably equal mix of changes in simply translating the top line and the expenses from the local currencies to the U.S. dollars. So, I don\u2019t think there is a pronounced difference between those two factors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities","Dominic, could you help us bridge the current top line guidance versus the prior, the prior was 4 to 5%, the current I think you said was 5.5 to 6.5%, and there was a lot of moving parts that you mentioned, but how much was it the increase due to Synthes and some of the offset? That\u2019s my first question.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Larry. Let me just try to give you a general order of magnitude on that. So, the addition of Synthes and I think you have to bear in mind that with the Synthes impact I\u2019m going to give you there\u2019s two other factors to bear in mind. The impact of the divestiture of the trauma business and we've taken into consideration some disruption in the overall business as a result of the integration and planning, etcetera. So, we\u2019ve increased our guidance about 2.5 points or thereabouts for the net of all that related to the Synthes integration and divesture of trauma, etcetera, and we have decreased the guidance about a little more than 1 point, maybe 1.2 points related to the supply disruptions we talked about earlier and having a better estimate now on the resupply of products in the OTC business. So, those two factors up 2.5, down 1.2 or thereabouts hopefully reconcile the change for you.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities","Then just two quick product questions. INCIVO was a little bit lighter than our expectations. Can you talk about what\u2019s happening in Europe there? And then just lastly on CONCERTA, does your guidance assume that any change to generic competition in 2012? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Let me take the last question first. On CONCERTA, we have not assumed any change with respect to the current generic competition, so status quo there for this year. And with respect to INCIVO I\u2019ll start by just commenting that we did see as Louise mentioned in her script discussion that in fact we saw some seasonal adjustments in the rate of treatment patterns throughout Europe. And maybe I\u2019ll ask Alex to comment some more as we have been through with the team to understand what\u2019s happening there with INCIVO.","Alex Gorsky","Overall, I\u2019d say we are really pleased with the launch of INCIVO. As we look at it starting I believe in about the fourth quarter of last year, it's uptake in terms of share as well as volume has been very impressive. A lot of the volume obviously coming out of France and Germany and so overall we are very pleased with it. We did see some deceleration of that as we went into the second quarter. A part of that we think is just due to the bullish or new urgent patients that you see in the larger markets when we got out there early in the year. Second we think there's probably some seasonality related to it. So if we combine all of that we are still very confident in what we think the future prospects for that drug look like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Sanderson with Cowen.","Ian Sanderson - Cowen & Company","If I could get an update on the XARELTO ACS regulatory process? In other words, at this point do you know what the FDA is looking for and if you have any rough guidance on when you may might be able to resubmit the NDA?"," ","Alex Gorsky","We are in an ongoing dialog right now with the Agency. We remain very confident in our file. You are obviously familiar with some of the comments that were made at the review committee. We are working our way through those and so again if we think if we look at the overall data set, we are confident that we are going to be able with the agency towards a positive resolution of that in the future.","Ian Sanderson - Cowen & Company","Also if I could ask a quick follow-up on the OTC, maybe this is better for Dominic, can you give us some sense of when we should see this spending ramp related to the relaunches? Would it be late this year or is most of that going to \u201812 and \u201813?","Dominic Caruso","As we said before, it's awfully difficult to predict the pace at which we will ramp up, but we will obviously not be spending on the relaunch of those products until we are confident that the supply situation is stabilized and we can provide a consistent supply to the market. So, I think we are going to monitor that and not get too far ahead of that quite frankly, because we want to ensure that there is first a consistent supply of product and then of course, we will invest significantly behind that once we achieve that. As we said before, we think the return of the products at the market will continue for the balance of 2012 and into 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jamie Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Alex, first, congratulations on your new appointment as CEO. In your prepared remarks and committing the Company to remaining a broad-based healthcare company, it sounds like you are coming out and rejecting some other strategies that your peers such as Abbott and Pfizer have embraced, in which the market has rewarded. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could comment on that. And then secondly, I guess this question is for Dominic. On the pharmaceutical side, it looks like international revenues slowed sequentially quite a bit despite much easier year-over-year comps because of the Merck agreement plus obviously increased sales from ZYTIGA and INCIVO you didn\u2019t have a year ago. So, maybe you could tie that with what you are seeing with the macro environment in Europe? I know sort of Alex touched upon the environment being worse, but not dramatically worse than you would expect it, but if you could parse out what you are seeing in terms of price declines, volumes, you had mentioned tenders, but if you could be a little bit more specific in what you are seeing in terms of receivables? Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","Thanks a lot for the question, and also we always appreciate the challenge and some of the background and comments that you have written about. What I\u2019d say and as you heard in my earlier comments, we do believe that based upon the evolving marketplace going forward, that our diversified portfolio gives us additional strength and will help us achieve further growth. That being said, we think that there are components of that model that are going to need to be ramped up to make us even more competitive. ","So, let me start with first the marketplace. As we look at their marketplace going forward, and particularly for example in the hospital space, we believe there will be further consolidation, further aggregation of some of those customers and as a result, we believe that they are going to be looking for more comprehensive offerings and greater solutions as well as outcomes versus just products. And in that case, when you have a very large portfolio depth and breadth of scale we think that that's going to be an important source of competitive advantage. Again, a good example of that may be with an ACO in the United States or frankly with some of the governments particularly in emerging markets where critical mass is particularly important and where we see a greater opportunity for growth. ","Next, we also think it\u2019s going to be important in terms of what we are actually offering. If we look at products, we think a great opportunity for differentiation is going to be combining and bringing convergent products or offerings forward. So in pharmaceutical, that may relate to biomarkers and diagnostics along with some of our therapeutics, in MD&D that may relate to things like the Fibrin Pad, or frankly things that we have done with our VICRYL Plus line, anti-infective suture devices and we think the scientific, the clinical, the regulatory as well as the commercial differentiation that that provides, is a real opportunity for us. That being said, we also realized that we are going to have to be likely more selective and more decisive in what areas we are going to be and where we are not going to be. So, we are going in fact through a strategic planning process as we speak and we are committed to making sure that we make those decisions and are putting our resources and energy in our effort behind the areas that we think are going to drive the greatest growth opportunities for us going forward. Dominic?"," ","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Jamie, in Europe, just a couple of comments, I think our overall growth in the pharmaceutical business internationally did grow, of course, second quarter versus first quarter sequentially, but we did see some impacts. I think pricing has in fact been an impact. The tender process has been an impact and in particular what we saw in Southern Europe it's much, much more difficult in the new tenders to get any sort of price increase, in fact they usually come with significant price decreases. So, we have seen that in the low single-digit rates that seems to be just accelerating maybe a little bit but not that pronounced. The real difference in the period is really just the timing of various tenders. I mean one example is, with respect to VELCADE, the timing of the tender in Russia is such that you don't see much of an impact this quarter and they will get that impact as the tender gets approved in the future. ","With respect to receivables, I will tell you that either it varies by different countries, so we just look at Southern Europe, our receivables continue to build in countries like Italy and a little bit in Greece, but in other countries such as Spain, our receivables have significantly decreased. We recently received a very significant payment from the Government of Spain. So, what we are doing is working very closely with all the governments with respect to payment terms, etcetera, but overall our second quarter receivables and days sales outstanding at the end of the second quarter are much better in Southern Europe than they were at the end of the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","I had a question, first returning to the topic of the portfolio and it sounds like there is some potential for an accelerating pace of divestitures. I was just wondering if that's a reasonable expectation as you come out of this strategic review.","Alex Gorsky","What I\u2019d say and we have been very clear about it with our management team is that, our goal is to be very decisive about what businesses we're in and that we are not in. We realized that when there are areas, where frankly we don't think we are going to make the difference for patients or we are not as competitive as we should be as we were in drug eluting stents, but we should divest or be out of those businesses and reallocate our resources elsewhere. And where we think there is a greater opportunity, Synthes, in those areas we think we should put additional resources and make the right investments to make us even more competitive. So, we are going to be very disciplined. We are going to be also very decisive in how we are going to go forward, recognizing dynamics in the healthcare marketplace.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","I did have one follow-up for Dominic, just regarding the operating margin expansion, 100 to 150 basis points this year. Now, I think a lot of us are looking for accelerating growth next year. And I\u2019m just wondering as we think about the operating margin expansion this year, are there elements in there that we should think of as not coming back in 2013, just to help us kind of gauge where our expectation should be?","Dominic Caruso","Rajeev, I think one of the things that point out about the 100 to 150 basis points expansion is, it\u2019s what we called for at the beginning of the year and despite the inclusion now and the guidance of the Synthes, with the Synthes amortization expense, we still think we\u2019re going to achieve 100 to 150 basis points expansion. So obviously, the underlying business at Synthes is performing in a more efficient manner than even we thought at the beginning of the year. How that continues for the balance of 2012 and into \u201813, I don\u2019t want to project into 2013 too much because obviously we want to make sure that we balance out the appropriate investments we want to make in the business as we go forward. The only thing I\u2019d say that's of any significant consequence in the current year and as we progress throughout the balance of \u201812 and into \u201813 is the remediation costs related to the consumer business are in fact higher than we thought this year, and hopefully as we go through that process, they should then tail off as we move into 2013, but we will see how the progress is and we will update you on that when we do the 2013 guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","I wanted to start with a couple of questions on the Synthes acquisition. Alex, I think that when you announced the deal over a year ago, you were talking about expectations for the trauma market growing 7% and since then it seems like the trauma market and nearly Synthes sales in particular have slowed. So I was wondering, what your expectations moving forward now were for the trauma market and Synthes sales in particular? And secondly, maybe you could talk a little bit about how you will be integrating the spine sales forces for Synthes and DePuy given the direct and indirect distributor models that you have? And then lastly maybe Dominic, what is your accretion guidance for Synthes assuming in terms of synergies?","Alex Gorsky","You are right. If we go back to the announcement and the discussion that we had, again the announcement of the Synthes deal, at that time if you looked historically at the trauma market I believe you saw historical growth rates that were very consistent in the 7% plus range. If you look about over the last 18 months, we have seen that come down probably reduced in about half consistent with what we have seen in a lot of the other MD&D markets. We think there is a number of factors that are driving that and at this point it's difficult to predict whether or not they are secular or cyclical. But some of them or as the macroeconomic environment has had an impact although it's a bit lagging relative to some of the other markets such as general surgery, in particularly that need kind of the discretionary procedures. We also believe there's been some seasonality issues, but just as you look at overall macroeconomic ranging from construction to weather to a lot of other things that may be impacting it. ","As we project going forward, we think likely the next couple of years, we are likely to see growth in the lower to mid single-digits versus what we had seen previously, but we would expect that to return to more robust levels as the economy picks up. We are also seeing obviously stronger growth in the emerging markets particularly in Asia-Pacific and some of the areas over there. So that gives you a little bit of background on what we think is going to happen overall with the trauma market. ","If we look at the integration with spines, first of all, we think the portfolios are very complementary. If you look at the two organizations coming together and I have been very impressed with the work that our team Michel Orsinger, Gary Fischetti and the rest of the team has done as we worked our way through this integration. As we mentioned earlier, we are pleased that if you look at our senior leadership, we have been able to retain our top leaders and while there has been some transition in the sales organization. Overall, we are pleased with the performance that we have seen and we expect to have a mix in our spine sales force of a direct as well as some distributors and that's going to vary between the U.S. and outside the U.S. But overall again we remain optimistic and we think that the spine market is a good opportunity longer term, but clearly it's come down and been impacted by some of the other events as well. ","Before I hand it to Dominic, let me just make one other statement regarding the overall Synthes integration. I think we are really pleased with what we have seen so far. The organizations have come together. They share a lot of the similar values. Again if you look at our turnover, if you look at the core performance of some of our segments ranging from trauma, recon, sports medicine, they were really solid in this quarter. When you look at the leadership and the people that we been able to maintain people and keep onboard through the transition, obviously we have lots of opportunities going forward to look at the synergies from our R&D as well as our supply chain and other issues in the backend. But we think this represents a significant opportunity for us going forward as the world-leading orthopedics and neurologic company. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","I mean one of the things that I mentioned, Derrick, about our guidance, which we gave as $0.03 to $0.05 for 2012 and $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in 2013, is that, it\u2019s largely based on growth and not primarily based on expense synergies, right. There are some expense synergies in those numbers but as we announced when we did the acquisition announcement early on, we said our primary focus here was going to be on growth of the businesses together. So on top line synergies and not so much of a focus on expense synergies. There will be some. I think it's important to note that the business is already a very profitable business that we are adding all into the Johnson & Johnson business and in fact, there are pre-tax operating margins. Excluding this impact of amortization, we\u2019re healthier than the overall Johnson & Johnson pre-tax operating margins. So, there will be some, we have included those in the estimates that we gave you for \u201812 and \u201913, but I don\u2019t see them as the major driver of the accretion.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Louise, just a quick housekeeping, can you repeat the INCIVO sales, I just missed that?","Louise Mehrotra","It contributed about 3.5% to the pharmaceutical international sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","With the Synthes acquisition now completed, can you talk about, Alex, the change in strategy for use of cash over the next 12 to 24 months? Was the deal structured with ASR to make it accretive to give you more flexibility on the acquisition front going forward and if so what healthcare assets would make the most strategic sense for J&J?","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Alex, let me take that on the overall use of cash. I think many of you have heard me discuss this, the answer to this question in the past. So just to reiterate, our primary focus is to generate, sustainable long-term free cash flow generation in the business, which we are very proud of our ability to do that and then we have prioritized and I think we will continue to prioritize our use of cash as first to dividends as a primary return to shareholders. Secondly, an investment in value creating acquisitions that enhance our ability to generate free cash flow in the future, and thirdly, any future returns of shareholders in the form of share buybacks. I don\u2019t think that the impact of the Synthes transaction changes our philosophy there in any significant way. We are also maintaining our AAA credit rating, which gives us enormous flexibility in our ability to fund our operations going forward or any particular investment we want to make. ","With respect to the accelerated share repurchase program, you are correct that, that is a factor in providing immediate accretion as opposed to a longer term accretion value and it's basically a result of needing to have the shares necessary to complete the acquisition in a relatively short period of time. After the regulatory approvals were received, we needed to close in a couple days obviously and rather than issue shares and buy them back over extended period of times, we elected to do what many companies have done before us to do an accelerated share repurchase program and obviously we had the financial strength to able to do that. So, we are very pleased with that.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","","And then just on the point as far as acquisitions go, would healthcare assets that exist today make strategic sense for J&J?","","Dominic Caruso","","Alex, I don't have my list handy, I don't know if you have.","","Alex Gorsky","","No Danielle, what I\u2019d say is, look we are looking for areas that, where we think first of all, there is a lot of unmet medical need, so it could be a new technology and new platform that just makes a big difference and that we think offers a real growth opportunity. The other areas are where there's an obvious complement to maybe something that we already have and we've got a number of examples of those. Some of the things where we have gone out in oncology, some of the recent things that we have done in other areas of our business represent those. And then sometimes it could be for vertical integration where we want to be able to become to more effective and more efficient about what we're doing. So, those are some of the strategic drivers that we look at, but obviously it's always done in the context of what the competitive environment is and other dynamics.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Two questions. First on bapineuzumab, it\u2019s probably one of the most anticipated trial results of the year. I think most investors in the street expect the primary endpoint to be missed. But let's assume that some of the secondary endpoints or some of the sub-group analysis is favorable. What does the company do at that point? Do you submit or you go back and do another clinical trial? That's my first question and then I had a follow-up for Alex as well.","Dominic Caruso","You know I don't think it's really appropriate for us at this point to speculate on it. Louise went through in pretty good detail. Our thoughts about bapineuzumab, in her comments and about where we are. So really until we get a look at the data it\u2019s difficult for us to speculate on it going forward. Obviously Alzheimer's is an area that we remain very excited about when you just consider the sheer unmet need and the opportunity for patients as well as for our business that it represents.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","And then just a second question on the hospital purchasing environment. In your prepared comments, you said utilization was stable, but it appears that Obama care is here to stay and this is going to add increased cost to hospitals. So, Alex, as you travel, what\u2019s your sense as you talk to hospital executives, CEOs, CFOs, on the CapEx side? Is this something that\u2019s going to flow here in the near-term or are we thinking about big ticket items that may get pushed off as the implementation of healthcare reform goes forward?","Alex Gorsky","Now it\u2019s a good follow-up, Glenn. Overall, look obviously we think that there are going to be opportunities as well as challenges associated with healthcare reform and how it ultimately gets rolled out. Certainly, if we look at some of the data, for example in the first quarter of this year what we have seen, hospital admissions up just about 2%. We saw some surgical procedures up around 4%. We saw lab procedures up at around 3%, ortho procedures up around 3%, offset with office visits actually down about 3%, the only caveat. That\u2019s first quarter data. That\u2019s the most recent data that we have.","And, frankly, we believe that the hospitals are going to be looking for ways to become more efficient and more effective across the board. And that's what we hear from our customers and again that\u2019s here in the United States as well as abroad. The offset of course in the United States is the increased volumes that the hospitals will be getting from the newly covered patients that will be coming into the system under healthcare reform. But clearly we would expect there to be additional challenges in the pricing environment and therefore all the more important, to my earlier statements as we look at our portfolio as we look at our capabilities, having a broad base, having offerings that go beyond the product, building on our relationships, building on our scale are going to be more and more important.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for Alex. And I appreciate the preamble and the reference to the credo on your long-term strategy. You mentioned emerging markets and so to the breadth of the products and technology that you can bring to those markets. I'm wondering, how do you expect to match some of the economic parameters of these emerging economies with some of the advanced top-tier products and brands you deliver. Really what some of your strengths are in developed markets? And maybe if you could put your recent China medical device acquisition, albeit small, into that strategic context? Then I have one follow-up.","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Matt, thanks a lot for the question. What I have seen having just recently been over to Russia and made a number of visits over to China as well as to Brazil and to some of the other emerging markets is, most importantly that the customer in those markets is the government. And what we've found is that the government is very interested as they are building their healthcare systems in the developing markets of not just replicating what's been done in the developed markets, but looking for ways to expand access and, frankly, also to expand and accelerate their access to some of the new technologies in a cost effective way. So, what we're doing is, first of all making sure that we're trying to work closely with them, and again this is where I think our breadth and depth and our scale is very important as Johnson & Johnson in those and if you look at our share position in a lot of those emerging markets, it remains very strong and competitive.","Second, it entails new offerings. And that's why we put R&D centers in many of these locations and we continue to invest in them. We're pleased with the rollout of products such as absorbable suture, linear cutters and staplers, that I would say are of very high quality yet more appropriate for those particular markets, both in terms of their actual construction as well as their pricing model. And some of our other things that we're working on right now, again, to take smart application of technology for those markets where we think there is a big opportunity. The other areas that we're focusing on frankly is training and education. And in many of those areas it's a case of trying to get more physicians trained on things like minimally-invasive surgery, on getting the right treatment paradigms for diabetes and cardiovascular procedures.","So, we're working closely, again, in many cases directly with the governments in China and Russia on extensive training programs to help them train their physicians. So, that's why we think that there, again, it's a significant opportunity. Related to our most recent acquisition in China, we're very excited about it. As we stated on a number of occasions, we think our biosurgicals area is one of our most exciting in terms of new science and technologies, they are really going to make a difference for patients as well as represent a significant growth opportunity for our business. And in China we\u2019ve been very limited in what we\u2019ve been able to do so far and with this most recent acquisition it's going to give us a source of a porcine based biologic that we\u2019ll be able to use there and roll out a significantly broader line of products to help patients and again grow our business. So we\u2019re very excited about that.","Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray","And then the one follow-up is a subject that\u2019s kind of emerged over the past several years, developed market question, specifically for the U.S., given the more challenging pricing and regulatory environment in the U.S. You speak about innovation. We know that that's important for J&J and for the industry, particularly in medical technology and medical devices though, maybe how should we think about what that means going forward? Are you placing longer duration bets on earlier stage technologies or do the shorter-term opportunities become tougher, more pricing, more commoditized, maybe help us understand what the path for innovations is for devices going forward in the U.S.?","Alex Gorsky","Sure. What I would say, Matt, it\u2019s going to take a combination and it really starts with innovation but different kinds of innovation. Now in some areas this is going to mean better technology that overall delivers better results for patients. So, some examples I would have of that is what we\u2019re doing with Biosense Webster and the great progress that they've made with so many of their products and the treatment of AFib. And just what you see is a huge difference for patients and for systems. We\u2019re also excited about a higher technology plan, something like the fibrin pad which we think can truly transform the way you treat moderate to severe bleeding intra-operatively and longer-term potentially for a trauma application.","So, areas like that, we see technology still being very, very important. But we also think it's going to be important in how we relate with our customers. And what I'm talking about there is innovating with the way that we work with them, that we partner with them, that we truly leverage our overall portfolio in working together. And obviously, it may include new services, new approaches, new partnerships with them in unique ways as they try to not only manage their increased patient volume but also try to manage their costs going forward as well.","And we also see an opportunity longer term to take some of these simplified approaches actually that we would develop in developing markets and basically bring them back to developed markets. We are already seeing some signs of that with things that we are doing in the diabetes space and potentially some others. So, we think even in developed markets people are going to be looking for very effective, but lower cost opportunities as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Alex, just a quick question to follow-up on some of the earlier ones on your perspective on utilization and I know your comments were as of Q1, but I'm just curious from, you look at the Q2 results and what you are hearing from the field. Is there anything different going on in the second quarter versus the first as far as you're concerned as it relates to surgical procedure volumes?","Alex Gorsky","No, we haven't seen significant changes. I have got to say we're encouraged by what we are seeing in orthopedics. If we look at overall worldwide joints against Q1, but as we look at the results we saw Q1 results around 3%, hips up about 1.5%, knees up about 3%, spine down slightly, although I think a slight improvement on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So, again we don't have second quarter, I think we're the first large orthopedics company coming out so we're going to have to wait and see with everyone else. That's our current view on it.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then a question on Synthes, in terms of some of the opportunities for you in the United States. I guess I'm curious as to how quickly you think you can benefit from the new scale that you have in orthopedics and how quickly we might see that translate into share gains, especially as it relates to some of the underperforming areas like spine which have been struggling below market for a couple of quarters. Just any thoughts on timing? Will this take a couple of years to really see the benefit or can we see tangible share gain process in the near-term you think as a result of your scale and ability to contract?","Alex Gorsky","Thanks, Bob. And again, I would start by saying how pleased I am with the performance of the team so far through such a significant and large-scale integration. We're really excited by again what we've seen so far. As you know, when you do these kind of things, leadership is so important and critical to keeping consistency through this kind of a process. I think we've been able to do that and obviously [Michelle] and his entire team are looking at ways for how do we accelerate growth going forward. Obviously, likely the biggest short-term challenge is spine, because you're bringing two organizations together. We are really pleased with the overall way we're able to work our way through the antitrust issues. We think we've got very complementary portfolios. And we're working our way through the integration with direct sales as well as some of our distributors sales as we speak. And we're are going to do everything that we can to accelerate it, but we also realize that look, this is a multi-year process and our first focus is with the customer. We want to make sure that our customer doesn\u2019t experience any disruption and in fact sees a net benefit to what we\u2019re doing.","So, we\u2019re working hard both with our sales forces as well as with our contracting organizations. Our second major area is our R&D prioritization and making sure that we are prioritizing the portfolios, looking for areas where there may be synergies across the different organizations, particularly in places like ENT or maxillofacial, or even in the areas such as biosurgicals and some of the things that we\u2019re doing here. So we think that there is a real -- biologics, there is a real opportunity. And then third, it\u2019s the area of how can we integrate our backend so to also make it very seamless, very efficient, and very effective. And so, again, we see it as really being prioritized in that order as we roll out over the next couple of years.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And what kind of disruption are you assuming on the sort of dis-synergies of sales related to the integration within spine? Is that sort of in the $30 million to $50 million range, Dominic? I think you mentioned that was part of the equation on guidance.","Dominic Caruso","Yeah, I won\u2019t be able to give you an exact number in that regard. But we did consider that in providing the guidance for both this year and the estimates we gave you in advance for next year. So, we do think there\u2019ll be some disruption as we convert and combine those two businesses together. But I won\u2019t be able to give you specifics, Bob, on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","I was just wondering, if you could comment a little bit further on just kind of the orthopedic trends that you saw in the quarter? It sounds like you guys are looking at the market as being improved from 1Q to 2Q. I just want to make sure I understand your comments were at just looking backwards at 1Q data. Then maybe just comment on the price and mix of orthopedics and whether the strength is coming from maybe improved price and mix as well as volumes?","Alex Gorsky","Yes. Let me just take a couple of parts of your question. The first thing that I would say is as we look overall at orthopedic trends, again it's difficult because we are the first company out. But if we look at the trends from Q1 combined with our sales results from Q2, I would say that we are slightly encouraged by what we're seeing and we're obviously going to be watching it very closely. We are not seeing the growth that we saw several years ago in what I'd call pre-recession times. And I'm particularly pleased with the performance of the DePuy Reconstruction Group, now the DePuy Synthes Reconstruction Group, through this period. And I think that's been the result of not only just really good execution through this integration process, but also the rollout of new products in both our hip and knee areas. So, I think that was important.","If we look at spine, we see some progress quarter-to-quarter. There is still significant pricing pressure on spine and other market dynamics, but again longer-term we see that as being an opportunity. But if I look specifically at our hip business what we saw overall was total price change of about down 4% mix up about 0.5%. So, a hip price mix change of about minus 3.4% for the quarter. And if we look at knees, if you look at product mix up around 2%, up about 1% on knee price and mix change and hip, so the overall for hip and knee we saw a mixed change of about minus 1%.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Perfect. And then anything you that you're seeing just across the broader medical device businesses in terms of pricing or do you have any concerns I guess going forward in light of the continued pressure in Europe that things may get more challenging on the price front?","Alex Gorsky","Look we do expect there to be continued pricing pressure. As Dominic mentioned earlier, you see some of that and particularly in Southern Europe with some of our other tenderings in Europe. We're seeing that in some of the U.S. markets, particularly those might be things like diabetes based upon some of the contracting as well as spine. We're seeing more in other areas. It's been pretty consistent with what we've seen in earlier trends.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Perfect. And then one last on the OTC business. I know, Dominic, you had mentioned that you had updated sales and I guess on the earnings side just for some changes on OTC. Am I correct in just assuming that things relative to kind of last quarter are just taking a little bit longer and it sounds like you're pushing off some of the expenses related to the launch maybe further out and potentially into 2013?","Dominic Caruso","Yeah. Well, just to clarify, so we did update our guidance, now that we -- on sales, that we have a full half-year already in and we have a pretty good idea what it's going to take to comply with the consent decree for the balance of the year. So we took that into consideration in the sales guidance that I gave you. And we still think that the products will still be rolling out in 2012 and through 2013 as we said before. Just to clarify that, we did not change our earnings guidance with respect to OTC at all. Right. We maintained our earnings guidance with respect to the base business despite some changes in sales and increased our earnings guidance as a result of the accretion related to Synthes. So, the impact of OTC is something we're just going to have to manage and we are managing in the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays.","Anthony Butler - Barclays","Alex, you've commented with respect to remediation and I realize it's a focus of that particular unit in consumer. But the question is, you made some statements about learning since the consent decree was actually signed. Could you comment on what one or two of those learnings have been? And then, I often note that there is a strain between the FDA and a company under a consent decree or there can be. Sometimes senior management needs to get directly involved and interface directly with the FDA. Have you found the need to do that at this point or do you think that people within the division are able to actually handle that process. And I have one follow-up, thanks?","Alex Gorsky","Tony, thanks a lot for your question. Let me start with the second half of that first and then I\u2019ll go back to the first part. First of all, we feel very good about our overall relationship with the FDA and it\u2019s one that we take very seriously, that we work on building in an appropriate way with a lot of open dialog and we think it's critically important that the most senior levels of the organization that we demonstrate a commitment and are clearly aligned around our goals and our plans going forward. And so, it absolutely involves people, the most senior level of the organization, including myself. So that\u2019s a real priority for us.","And again, we see the FDA as a very important partner not only in this area of our business but really in all areas of our business where ultimately we are attempting to get products to patients or to patients in a timely and well considered manner. I think the other aspect when you talk about learnings as you\u2019re going through it, a couple of thoughts, Tony. First of all, while we agreed to the consent decree about a year ago, the actual submission of the consent decree didn't go until like Q3 of last year. And so, you continue to work with the agency on all the specifics steps as we worked our way through the agreement process and getting aligned, that's one aspect.","The second is we are working with an outside party [Quantic], that is working with us, verifying, validating different procedures. So, that's also a learning process as they come onboard ensuring that we're fulfilling all the commitments that we have made along the way. I'd say the third significant learning for us is getting the right balance between our consent decree requirements resources and commitments and then also producing product and getting into the marketplace. Our customers, working with them are clearly interested in getting a consistent and reliable supply. We are very encouraged that when we have got product back on the shelves that we've seen a very solid demand on the part of customers. But that's something as well that we're working, again, very deliberately on and that we will make sure we want to get right having that balance going forward.","Anthony Butler - Barclays","Thank you very much for that color. Then a smaller, more modest question. While consumer operationally was up sequentially, modestly, wound care struck me as being down. And while Q1 was actually up year-over-year due to new products, I'm curious what may have occurred in Q2 to drive wound care in a different direction?","Alex Gorsky","Yes. Tony, we have seen some competitive pressure and I know that in one case we decided not to go ahead with the contract on some of our first aid kits, but overall we think we remain fairly competitive.","Louise Mehrotra","This will be our last question and then we'll have some closing remarks from Alex.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Alex, I wanted to come back to your short-term priorities and your long-term priorities. McNeil obviously was your significant first short-term priority and Global was your second long-term priority. And I guess in most of the comments today there is a great focus on McNeil, but if I sort of go with the intersection of those two comments, it seems like if you take your broader kind of holistic consumer business, emerging markets for consumer seems that it should be a much greater priority for the total business and a much bigger potential gross impactor than McNeil. Can you just sort talk about how you see your emerging market consumer franchise versus your peers and steps you can take to perhaps accelerate growth there?","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Thanks a lot for the question Davis. You're absolutely right. The emerging market growth in our consumer business is a top priority for us. And we've been focused there for a number of years. If you look at, for example, the acquisition that we did with Dabao several years ago, we see a tremendous opportunity. We're seeing very strong performance as of late, particularly in Brazil. China we\u2019ve dealt with a few other issues, but we're very confident in our long-term positioning there and we've also made some changes in our approach in Russia as well. So we do see that as a major growth opportunity. That being said, or over-the-counter business particularly domestically as well as internationally is significant and so we know that that's a major priority for us.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just, Dominic, one quick clarification. I know you're very specific on the change in underlying operational guidance on the revenue side and the factors. If I think about the absolute change that implies to the back half of the year, it seems large relative to the size of the divisions like OTC and energy you mentioned. Is there anything else that's a big driver of that relative change other than OTC or energy?","Dominic Caruso","Now I think that it's primarily OTC for the change in guidance and to a lesser extent the impact of energy, and as we mentioned earlier the supply constraints in the endovascular business. But I'd say of that total, it's primarily the OTC change when I compare the current guidance to the previous guidance.","Alex Gorsky","So hey everybody, thank you very much. I hope after the discussions that we\u2019ve had this morning that you have a better understanding of our strategies, priorities and plans to really help more patients and to drive our growth going forward. Please keep in mind that the contributions we make to our shareholders always start from the innovative, ever-increasing contributions our employees make every day to patients and consumers all around the world. I really believe that healthcare is one of the most important and rewarding industries around the globe and we look forward to Johnson & Johnson to helping lead it, shape it for many years to come. Thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2012 earnings conference call.

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Johnson & Johnson, you may begin.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, and welcome. I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2013. Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer and Michel Orsinger, Worldwide Chairman of DePuy Synthes Companies.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available to a broader audience via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I will begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the third quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments.","Following my remarks, Michel will provide an update on our DePuy Synthes business and the progress made on our near-term priorities in successfully integrating Synthes. Please note the presentations that accompanies Michel's remarks is available on our website.","Next Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the financial results and guidance for 2013. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release.","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","Now, I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled, supplementary sales data by geographic area.","Worldwide sales to customers were $17.6 billion for the third quarter of 2013, up 3.1% as compared to the third quarter of 2012. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.7% and currency had a negative impact of 1.6%. In the U.S., sales were up 1.7%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.1%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.9 points. Europe grew 8.4% on an operational basis while the western hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 8% operationally. Asia-Pacific\/Africa region grew 5.1% operationally. The success of new product launches made strong contributions to the results in all regions.","If you now turn to the consolidated statements of earnings, net earnings were $3 billion consistent with the 2012 results. Earnings per share were $1.04 versus $1.05 a year ago.","Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the accompanying table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2013 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after-tax special items of $937 million, primarily related to an increase in the accrual for litigation expenses, in-process research and development and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Synthes.","Third quarter 2012, net earnings included after-tax special items of approximately $553 million as shown in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.36, representing increases of 11.3% and 8.8%, respectively as compared to the same period in 2012.","I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move onto the segment highlights. For the third quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 30.4%, was down 240 basis points from the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2012, we recorded an inventory step up charge related to the Synthes acquisition. Excluding the inventory step up charge, which was treated as a special item, cost of goods sold decreased 150 basis points versus the same period last year. Positive mix, strong volume growth in our Pharmaceutical business and cost improvement initiatives across many of the businesses was partially offset by the impact of the medical device excise tax.","Third quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses, were 30.2% of sales, or 40 basis points lower than our 2012 results due to cost containment initiatives across many of the businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.6%, up 30 basis points due to increased spending in the Pharmaceuticals business. Interest expense, net of interest income of $87 million was down $33 million versus the third quarter of 2012, due to a lower average debt level.","Other expense net of other income of $943 million in the third quarter of 2013, compared to other income net of other expense of $19 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense of $43 million was $132 million less than 2012, due primarily to the impact of 2012 gains on divestitures. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.9% in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 22.2% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide commentary on taxes in his remarks.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the third quarter of 2013. I will begin with the consumer segment.","Worldwide consumer segment sales for the third quarter of 2013 of $3.6 billion, increased 0.8% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 2%, while the impact of currency was negative 1.2%. U.S. sales were up 0.9%, while international sales grew 2.6% on an operational basis.","Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, operational growth was approximately 2.5%. Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 2.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2012, due primarily to the impact of the health care products acquired earlier this year.","Sales in the Oral Care business decreased 3% operationally. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of manual toothbrushes in North America, operational sales were essentially flat.","For the third quarter of 2013, sales for OTC Pharmaceuticals increased 6.5% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2012. U.S. sales were up 17.9%, driven by strong growth in analgesics and other key brands as we continue to make progress in returning a reliable supply of products to the marketplace.","International sales were up 2% operationally. Our skin care business grew 2.7% on an operational basis in the third quarter of 2013. Strong results for AVEENO were partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Excluding divestitures, operational growth was approximately 4%. Women's health grew 2.5% on an operational basis due to growth in international women's sanitary protection products. Wound care other sales decreased 6.9% on an operational basis impacted by competitive pressures as well as divestitures.","That completes our review of the consumer segment and I will now review highlights for the pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide net sales for the third quarter of $7 billion increased 9.9% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 10.9% with a negative currency impact of one point. Sales in the U.S. increased 7.9%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 14%.","Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas. Immunology products grew 13.4% operationally, with sales in the U.S. up 3% and sales outside the U.S. up 47.7% operationally. Earlier this year, the company made certain supply chain changes for REMICADE resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales now being recorded as international sales. Adjusting for this impact the U.S. immunology growth was approximately 8% and operational growth outside the U.S. was approximately 28%.","In the U.S., REMICADE excluding export sales was up 7.8%, SIMPONI was up 19.4% and STELARA are was up 23.9%. Results were driven by market growth across the major products complemented by increased market share for both STELARA and SIMPONI. With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. REMICADE outside the U.S., adjusted for the supply chain change just mentioned, was up approximately 15% operationally due to strong growth in Canada and the emerging markets. STELARA made significant contributions to growth outside the U.S. due to market share gains and market growth across the major regions while SIMPONI's strong growth was due to increased shipments to our distribution partner, complemented by additional country launches and strong growth in other markets.","Sales of infectious disease products increased 2.4% on an operational basis. INCIVO, a treatment for Hepatitis C, grew 5.3% on an operational basis, reflecting launches in additional countries partially offset by lower sales in Europe impacted by a combination of patient warehousing, patients enrollment in clinical trials and seasonality in treatment patterns impacting new patient starts in the summer months. Continued momentum in market share growth in the major markets for PREZISTA made notable contributions to the results. Results outside the U.S. were impacted by the timing of tender business. Strong growth for the combined sales of COMPLERA and EDURANT also contributed to the results.","Neuroscience product sales declined 1.9% operationally with U.S. sales down 11.4% impacted by generic competition primarily for CONCERTA. The long-acting injectable antipsychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENA or XEPLION achieved operational growth of over 15% due to an increase in combined market share. Sales of oncology products increased 57% on an operational basis due to the strong results for ZYTIGA and VELCADE. ZYTIGA is approved to treat both chemo refractory and chemo na\u00efve metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.","In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 70%, with U.S. sales growing 50% due to very strong market growth of nearly 25% and increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer market. ZYTIGA has captured 33% of that market and is up approximately 2.5 points sequentially. ZYTIGA sales outside the U.S. nearly doubled on an operational basis versus third quarter of 2012 and on a sequential basis, sales were up over 15%. Additional country rollouts and the expansion of the label to chemo na\u00efve patients drove the strong results. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries.","VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 26.3% on an operational basis. Strong performance in patient share in the frontline setting and the launch of the subcutaneous version continue to drive sales growth. Other oncology increased primarily due to DOXIL\/CAELYX. Regarding DOXIL\/CAELYX, ensuring a efficient supply for physicians and their patients remained our urgent priority. We have begun to encounter supply outages of DOXIL in the U.S. due to issues at our third-party manufacturer. We continue to take the steps needed for the long-term transition to suppliers, which we are accelerating wherever possible. The FDA has approved the generic doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, which is currently available for patients.","In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP has approved manufacturing at CAELYX from an alternate supplier. We anticipate receiving CAELYX from this manufacturer by the end of the year.","Other pharmaceutical products increased 5.9% on an operational basis with strong results for XARELTO and INVOKANA partially offset by lower sales for EPREX and PARIET, primarily related to generic competition.","XARELTO more than tripled compared with the same quarter last year and grew nearly 30% on a sequential basis, reaching nearly 40% of the new two brand scripts in cardiology in September, surpassing warfarin by over eight points and widening the lead by three points versus the last quarter.","Total prescription exit share in the broader anticoagulant market grew approximately 1.5 points on a sequential basis to nearly 10%.","In the U.S., INVOKANA achieved 17% new to brand share with endocrinologists within the defined market of type-2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin. At 17%, INVOKANA is the number one branded non-insulin product NBRx in that market. In addition to the number of approvals and filings that Dominic will highlight in his remarks, during the quarter, ibrutinib was granted priority review by the FDA for the use in the treatment of previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or CLL, and small lymphocytic lymphoma or SLL and for its use in the treatment of previously treated patients with mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL. In late February, PDUFA date has been assigned.","We announced the simultaneous submissions of a biologic license application to FDA and a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency or EMA for siltuximab, an experimental product for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease. The resubmission to the FDA complete response for the use of XARELTO to reduce the risk of secondary cardiovascular events and [Centrum] in patients with acute coronary syndrome was filed with a PDUFA date of mid-February, next year.","In October, a marketing authorization application was submitted to the EMA, seeking approval for a once-daily single tablet fixed dose antiretroviral combination product containing darunavir, a protease inhibitor developed by Johnson with cobicistat, a pharmacokinetic enhancer developed by Gilead Sciences for use in combination with other HIV-1 medicines.","That completes the review of the Pharmaceutical segment. I will now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide medical devices and diagnostic segment sales of $6.9 billion, declined 2% versus for the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 0.3% with a negative currency impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the U.S. declined 4.2%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 4.2%. Adjusted for divestitures and exits from certain businesses, underlying growth was approximately 1% reflecting continued market and pricing pressure.","I will provide more commentary on these factors in the franchise reviews. Starting with cardiovascular care, sales were up 4.2% operationally with U.S. up 0.5%, and sales outside the U.S. up 6.6% operationally, driven by Biosense Webster, our Electrophysiology business, with worldwide operational growth of over 11% in the quarter. The success of a number of capital launches made strong contributions to the results.","Diabetes care sales declined 11.3% on an operational basis in the third quarter of 2013 with the U.S. business down 27.7% due to the impact of lower price primarily related to competitive bidding. The business outside the U.S. was up 6.5% operationally with strong sales in the emerging markets partially offset by lower sales in some of the developed markets. The success of the launch of Animas Vibe in certain international countries has contributed to growth in the quarter.","The diagnostics business declined 8% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of the Virco's business, operational sales were down approximately 2.5% due to the exit from certain donor screening contracts and lower capital placements. Infection prevention decreased 0.5% on an operational basis with sales in the U.S. down 7.1% due to the soft capital equipment sales reflecting a lower level of trade-ins. Outside the U.S., operational growth of 4.3% was driven by both consumables and capital item sales.","Orthopedic sales were up 1.1% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2012 with the U.S. down 0.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.4%. Operationally, hips were up 6% worldwide driven by 7% growth in U.S. due to strong results on primary stent platforms sales partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were up 4% on the operational basis driven mainly by heads and acetabular products. Knees worldwide increased 3% on an operational basis with similar results both in and outside the U.S. Growth in the U.S. was due to the successful launch of ATTUNE Fixed Bearing Knee as well as strong sales of Revision platforms partially offset by lower sales of rotating platforms and pricing pressure. The launch of ATTUNE drove the results outside the U.S.","Trauma was up 1% on an operational basis with the U.S. flat and outside the U.S., up 2% operationally. Low cost competition impacted to the results in the U.S. while the timing of tender business negatively impacted the results outside the U.S. Worldwide spine was down 2% on an operational basis with the U.S. down approximately 10% impacted by pricing pressures, the continued softness in the market as well as the disruption in the commercial sales organization as we integrate the businesses. Outside the U.S., sales were up approximately 9% operationally, with strong growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific.","Specialty surgery operational growth was 6.7% in the third quarter of 2013. U.S. sales were up 4.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 9.2% on an operational basis. Strong sales of biosurgical products and international sales of energy products were the major contributors to growth, complemented by sales growth from new products for both MENTOR and ACCLARENT. These gains were partially offset by lower sales of HARMONIC products in the U.S. due to competitive pressures.","Surgical care worldwide sales were up 1.4% on an operational basis, with U.S. down 2.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.9% operationally. U.S. sales were impacted by lower sales of women's health and urology products. Outside the U.S., future sales and strong demand for endocutter products with the ECHELON FLEX powered ENDOPATH Stapler were the important drivers of growth.","Rounding up the review of the medical devices and diagnostic segment. Our vision care business achieved operational sales growth of 3.9% in the third quarter with U.S. up 1.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9% operationally. Growth was driven by daily lenses and ASTIGMATISM lenses. That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2013.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michel Orsinger. Michel?","Michel Orsinger","Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to providing you with an update on the integration of the DePuy and Synthes, the value we are seeing in the combination of these two companies and our strategy for leading and shaping the industry. Having now worked with Johnson & Johnson prior to the Synthes acquisition, and now as a J&J leader, I have had ample opportunity to get to know the enterprise and discover its richness, breadth, resources and capabilities.","I am very impressed by the values expressed in our credo and the ability of a large global organization to nourish and live by such values in an increasingly complex world. I now have a lot of respect for the people in Johnson & Johnson.","Before I start my presentation, I would like to give my perspective on the DePuy Synthes third quarter results that Louise presented. While I am not entirely satisfied with our results, we have had some important wins. Joint reconstruction, especially in the U.S., is performing very well and we believe we grew market share in hips. Furthermore we generated double-digit growth in emerging markets with the best results coming from China, Russia and Brazil.","Our performance in trauma and U.S. spine was lower than expected. Trauma results were due mostly to a biannual tender that did not repeat this year and pressure from lower price competition which we are managing by leveraging sales force coverage, segmenting the market and introducing new product configurations. U.S. spine results were due to integration disruptions which we are addressing.","Overall, we are pleased to maintain our strong market leadership positions. I am very confident about the future. DePuy and Synthes, two of the most successful and respected companies in orthopedics and neuro, joined together at the right time to actively participate in and shape the changing healthcare environment. I am convinced that we are all well positioned to expand our leadership in the industry and I am excited by the opportunities in front of us.","As a combined organization, we are better suited to optimize our offerings. For patients and surgeons, there is the potential for exciting medical innovations that leverage the product development capabilities from both organizations as well as from the larger J&J enterprise. For providers, our scaled and unparalleled product portfolio which spans many platforms opens new possibilities to consolidate suppliers. In emerging markets, the same benefit will enable us to continue accelerating growth. In addition, our larger experienced sales force, leadership and professional education, and collaboration with the AO, and the values driven, combined talent from both organizations offer competitive differentiation in the industry.","DePuy Synthes participates in a market that has very strong fundamentals. At $44 billion the market is large and diverse. There is plenty of opportunity to address unmet orthopedic and neuro needs. We believe that as the global population ages, demand for the types of products we offer will increase and many emerging markets are investing in the healthcare systems to provide more and better care for their citizens.","As you look over our planning horizon, emerging market growth is projected to increase roughly four times the rate of developed markets. As healthcare systems around the world face the reality of cost containment and provide us participate more in decision making with clinicians, DePuy Synthes as part of J&J is primed to offer new value-added solutions and help transform healthcare delivery.","Against the backdrop of these market dynamics, we are expecting the worldwide ortho and neuro market to grow between 2% and 4% compounded annually by 2017. Our first year at DePuy Synthes has been exciting and rewarding. As you can imagine combining two organizations of this size and complexity is a significant undertaking. Our employees are doing a great job and I am pleased to say the integration is on track.","Our primary goal during the integration was to minimize customer disruption. Based on feedback from customers, we believe we have achieved this in all, but one platform. As we combine two different sales forces with two different sales models in U.S. spine, we have experienced some disruptions in that business and we continue to take corrective measures.","In other parts of the business, I am particularly encouraged to see synergies being realized by cross-selling initiatives we envisioned from the onset, as well as revenue and cost synergies. Initially having very much focused on commercial integration, we are now spending more time on internal systems and processes, including IT, HR, supply chain and quality. This work remains a priority as the successful integration is one of the foundational elements of our future.","We have combined terrific talent from both organizations and supplemented our team with new capabilities to help address the changes in our markets. We achieved a high retention rate of our global DePuy Synthes staff during integration and we are engaging in a new innovation agenda.","Our strategy is focused on four growth drivers. We have continued to transform our business and drive growth through continuous innovation, focus on emerging markets, excellent execution and cultivation of talent and an engaged organization. For the rest of today's discussion, I will focus on our approach to innovation and our emerging market strategy.","In today's dynamic healthcare environment, our customers are looking for new solutions that improve clinical outcomes, increased patient satisfaction and do this at reduced cost, specifically to address patient satisfaction and to unmet patient needs, improving the instability some patients experience with existing knew replacements.","ATTUNE also was developed to address provider interest in outcomes and efficiency of healthcare delivery. To-date, 27 publications document the science behind the design thereby addressing our stakeholders' need for evidence. The ATTUNE knee system launch is off to a very successful start with positive feedback from patients, surgeons and physical therapists. Following commercialization in North America, launches are underway in 13 European and Asia-Pacific countries.","In addition to developing new products, we have started to complement our product offering with value-added programs and services. Let me describe one such program we are piloting, DePuy partnered with CAELYX [ph] and Janssen to create a program to help hospital reduce the length of stay for joint replacement patients while enhancing quality of care and patient satisfaction. The result is a patient care pathway program called Care4Today Orthopedic Solutions that integrates patient education, a change management program for hospitals and home recovery support. The first impressive results from the pilot show reduced patient length of stay and excellent patient and staff feedback.","The third pillar of innovation is new business models. We are piloting many different cross-selling arrangements across DePuy Synthes and J&J that leverage our considerable product portfolio. For example, in the U.S., joint recon distributors are selling power tools and they are in community and they are rural community and rural hospitals selling trauma. Trauma is selling joint week on as sports medicine products in academic centers. Sports medicine is selling trauma products in community and rural hospitals and ambulatory research centers. Across Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon is selling and marketing CMS tissue metrics product as part of its hernia portfolio.","We formed a strategic account management group that is leveraging our broader offerings to become one point of contact for all of our customers' orthopedic and neuro needs. As providers seek to reduce vendors, the team is steadily gaining traction in identifying and winning accounts that would benefit most from our comprehensive portfolio.","Taking collaboration one step further we are in active discussions with large institutions to jointly define value, based on their specific needs, set new standards and pilot entirely new approaches to delivering healthcare. The combination of the DePuy and Synthes and even the broader efforts across MD&D and J&J, place us in a very unique position to accomplish these goals.","Now, I would like to move to another significant source of future growth, emerging markets. These countries represent a small part of our revenue at this point, yet we anticipate close to 40% of our projected growth in years to come from these countries. Today, I will focus on China where DePuy Synthes has a strong foundation.","Our three pronged strategy there is based on helping patients gain access to care. First the premium segments remains vital to our business and it will continue to provide innovations for the urban customer segments. While doing so we will continue to refine core products to match different anatomical and search and preferences.","Our second strategy is to develop value segment products which are simple, easy to ease and more affordable options for underserved patients in more rural areas. We are adapting existing premium products that still maintain our high quality standards. One example is our rich knee instruments, a simplified instrument set for the Sigma Fixed Bearing Knee. We are planning the launch of this affordable option in China and India this year.","Our other differentiating approach to the fast growing value segment is to become a local supplier in China for trauma. Products that are manufactured and have undergone clinical trials in China are considered local and give us access to a whole new market segment with attractive reimbursements.","A few years ago, we took the strategic decision to build a plant in Suzhou, which helps us to maintain our manufacturing standards and also invested in clinical trials for trauma products. In fact, we have breaking news on this front. Just this past Saturday, we received our product license for domestic manufacturer for four classes of trauma products. We will launch these locally manufactured and approved products next year, giving us a significant advantage in addressing the value segments.","Finally, as the demand for healthcare in the region grows, more surgeons need training. Considering our broad-based product portfolio, we are exploring expansion of our collaboration with the AO Foundation into new clinical areas beyond trauma in Asia-Pacific.","With DePuy Synthes support, the AO offered its first ever neuro trauma course in Beijing and Shanghai. In November, the AO will offer its first ever joint reconstruction course in China. In conclusion, we are making tremendous progress, positioning our business for long-term profitable growth. We recognize the unique opportunity to address the needs of our customers and form strategic alliances.","We are redefining innovation, accelerating growth in emerging markets and developing new capabilities and leadership skills in our organization. I look forward to sharing our progress as our transformation continues. We have only just begun to realize the power of this great combination.","Thank you. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso.","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Michel, and good morning everyone. I must say, we are very fortunate to have Michel leading our DePuy Synthes business with his level of energy, strong leadership and clear vision for the world's largest orthopedics business and I very much enjoy working with Michel as a member of our management committee.","Now, I would like to turn to our third quarter results, review some achievements during the quarter and provide an update on our guidance for 2013. I will begin with a brief comment about what we are seeing in the overall healthcare market.","At this time, we are still seeing utilization rates that are essentially flat year-over-year supporting a continued stable environment which is similar to what we saw in the second quarter. At Johnson & Johnson, the level of consistently solid and sustainable performance we deliver is due to the breadth of our business and the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our people around the world.","Our third quarter results reflect the progress we are making in achieving our near-term priorities of delivering strong business results, returning a reliable supply of OTC products for the marketplace, successfully integrating Synthes and building on a strong momentum in the pharmaceutical segment. Our innovative products are clearly making a meaningful difference in the treatment of patients.","We have also continued to make advancements in the implementation of our longer-term strategic growth drivers of creating value for innovation as evidence by the productivity of our pipeline and success for our nearly launched products, focusing on excellence and execution, leading with purpose and by increasing our global reach with greater local focus, which is reflected by our double-digit operational growth this year in the BRIC countries.","Let's now review some of the highlights of the Q3 results. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with sales of $17.6 billion, representing an increase of nearly 5% on an operational basis versus the third quarter of 2012, and earnings per share excluding special items of $1.36, or a nearly 9% increase over the prior year. As you can see, we recorded special items in the quarter of approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis that consisted largely of charges related to an increase in our accrual for various litigation matters, charges for in-process for search and development and continued integration and transaction cost associated with the Synthes acquisition.","Together these special items negatively impacted our third quarter results by $0.32 per share. We have consistently treated these types of matters as special items. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.36, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as reported by first call of $1.32.","Now, let's look at sales performance and some important business developments by segment.","In pharmaceuticals, we reported operational sales growth in the quarter of approximately 11%. Fueled by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA, REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA, VELCADE and PREZISTA and new products including XARELTO, INVOKANA and ZYTIGA which has well exceeded $1 billion in global sales this year also recorded very strong sales in the quarter contributing to that segment's continued growth.","Other developments off note in the pharmaceutical segment included the successful completion of the acquisition of Aragon Pharmaceuticals which we initially announced in June. This acquisition increases our leadership position in the field of prostate cancer and strengthens our pipeline with a potentially best-in-class compound that has just advanced in the Phase 3 development that, if approved, would complement ZYTIGA and broaden the range of patients that could potentially be treated.","Several important positive regulatory decisions were also made on some of our key products including the FDA's approval of SIMPONI ARIA, the IV version of SIMPONI for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and STELARA for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. In Japan, the Ministry of Health approved simeprevir which will be marketed as SOVRIAD for the treatment of genotype-1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection and XEPLION, the first once-monthly atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia approved in that country.","In Europe, the European Commission approved VELCADE as the first therapeutic option in a combination approach for adults with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are deemed eligible for high dose chemotherapy with hematological stem cell transplantation, STELARA for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with response to previous non-biological drug therapy when that has been inadequate and also SIMPONI for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had inadequate response to conventional therapy or who are intolerant to such therapies. Also in Europe, the CHMP granted a positive opinion on INVOKANA for the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes.","We also increased our leadership presence in the hepatitis C market just last week with the acquisition of a Phase 2 compound for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C from an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline. Under the terms of the deal, we acquired all rights to develop and commercialize that product.","In our MD&D segment, sales were essentially flat versus the prior year on an operational basis reflecting the continued market and pricing pressures as well as divestitures already described by Louise. Of note, however, was double-digit operational growth that we saw in the BRIC markets. Biosense Webster's electrophysiology products and our cardiovascular care business continues to deliver strong growth as did joint reconstruction products in the orthopaedics business, international sales in the surgical care business and continued group performance in the specialty surgery business.","Our consumer business saw an operational sales increase of 2%. Positive contributors to the operational results were analgesic brands MOTRIN and TYLENOL, AVEENO skincare products and international sales of baby care products.","I want to comment that as we continued to return a liable supply of high quality OTC product for the shelves, we are seeing strong uptick in the market, and as you can see, our U.S. OTC business posted strong nearly 18% growth in the quarter.","Now let me provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2013. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the third quarter we had approximately $10 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and $15 billion of debt.","We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which in this quarter were essentially offset by the finalization and related cash settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program that was initiated in conjunction with the acquisition of Synthes. With that program now completed, we have resumed our normal share repurchases related to employee compensation programs. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I would suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $350 million and $400 million slightly lower than our previous guidance.","Turning to other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items of litigation, investments by our development corporation and divestitures, asset sales or write-offs. This account is difficult to forecast but at this late stage of the year, we would be comfortable with your models for 2013 reflecting other income and expense as a net gain, excluding any special items ranging from approximately $500 million to $600 million, which is lower than our previous guidance.","Now a word on taxes. For the third quarter of 2013, the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was 19.3%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 at approximately between 19% and 19.5%, which is a tightening of the previous range. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate during the remainder of the year.","Now turning to sales and earnings. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth on a constant currency basis of between approximately 6% and 7% for the year which is consistent with our previous guidance. This would result in estimated sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.3 billion to $71.9 billion.","While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give an idea of the potential impact of currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2013, were to stay where they were as of last week, but our sales growth rate will be negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% for the year. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 4.5% and 5.5% for the year for an expected level of reported sales of approximately between $70.3 billion and $70.9 billion which is higher than our prior guidance mostly due to the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S.","dollar.","Turning now to earnings, considering the strength we see in our operating results, which will more than offset the expected lower level of other income guidance I mentioned earlier, we suggest that you consider full year 2013 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items of between $5.44 and $5.49 per share at constant currency rates. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements. However, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates for the balance of 2013, were to remain where they were as of the end of last week, then our reported earnings per share excluding special items would see no impact related to currency fluctuations, therefore we suggest that you model our reported earnings per share excluding special items in the range of between $5.44 and $5.49 per share or a growth of between 7% and 8% which at the mid-point is higher than our previous guidance.","Overall, as you update you models for the guidance I just provided, you should see pre-tax operating margins will continue to show improvement over the prior year and we now expect that improvement will be greater than 100 basis points. This will more than offset the expected level of other income as for our updated guidance. We feel confident we can achieve an even better improvement than we expected at the beginning of the year given the strength of our operating performance while we continue to invest in growth for the future.","Finally, a word on the impact of foreign currency transactions related to the devaluation of the yen, which may be helpful for you as you update your models. As you know, the yen devalued by approximately 25% versus the U.S. dollar and the euro this year. The impact of the yen devaluation on 2013 results has not been significant, because of our policy of advanced hedging of foreign currency transactions in a matter that provides certainty in our planning related to currency swings during the year. However, we expect the impact of devaluation of the yen to be a significant headwind in 2014. We estimate this headwind to negatively impact gross margin in 2014 by approximately 60 basis points. Of course, as we complete our planning for 2014, we will look for ways to mitigate this impact as much as possible.","Now back to you Louise for the question-and-answer session.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. Felicia, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citicorp.","Matthew Dodds - Citicorp","Dominic, first for you. If you look at the geographic results, Europe has grown a lot faster than the U.S. I assume pharma is a big part of it, but do you think you are also gaining share in Europe and MD&D? Then broadly for Europe, what do you think about the environment for Europe in Q3 versus Q2? That's for you Dominic.","Then Michel for you, in U.S. spine, I thought the integration started in the fourth quarter of last quarter. So why is the hit seem like again it's getting worse as we are moving through 2013 and when do you think that all sorts out?","Dominic Caruso","Right. Hi, Matt. Good morning. Well, you are right. We do see strong growth in Europe. It is primarily driven by the pharmaceutical business, as obviously we have launched some exciting new products in the pharma business. In MD&D, we continue to see government austerity pressures and, quite frankly, a reduction of overall volumes in those businesses. However we seem to making pretty good progress in the Ethicon Surgical Care business and even in our diabetics and the DePuy legacy business in Europe as well.","Michel Orsinger","Good morning, Matt. Indeed related to our U.S. spine performance, we have and continue to go through some disruptions, while we are very excited about our international business growing at plus 9%. Now related to the U.S. changes, as you can imagine, combining two sales forces from two different companies is a major task. We are combining different selling models, distributor base versus a direct setting model. Two sales people are calling on the same accounts on the same hospitals requiring realignment of territories.","The sales force having to deal short-term with the complexity of two different systems, processes, it all takes time. Just as one example, sales consulting, as consultants ordering products need to do this from two different legacy ordering systems which need to be harmonized through IT and that obviously can lead to some frustrations by the sales force. But having said so, we are taking clear measures, ongoing measures, at very different levels, related primarily to ensure we can provide better support to the sales force, make their job easier but at the same time also provide enhanced and harmonized compensation and benefit packages.","We are in the final stage of realigning our territories and I think people, customers but also our sales people do recognize that we, having the opportunity to combine two product bags, have one of the most attractive product offering, specially leveraging the strength of legacy Synthes in the cervical area, leveraging the strength of legacy DePuy in the lumber area. So time will help to stabilize the sales force and to create the stronger spine company also in the U.S.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Thanks Michel. Thanks, Dominic","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Hi, thank you for that. Thanks for taking the questions this morning. Since we have Michel, Michel, with this one comment you made, the step that you made, you talked about lower price competition in trauma and it wasn't clear if you were talking in the U.S., if you were talking emerging market. So could you explain on that? Thanks.","Michel Orsinger","The lower price competition we have been observing is primarily located in the U.S. We have seen some smaller companies trying to offer very specific product segments in specific institutions. So we are clearly taking corrective measures by working on major initiatives related to segmentation, customer segmentation, channel segmentation and products.","We are going to counteract by also cross selling and certainly elevating our agenda with our customers leveraging our breadth and size of our portfolio through contracts and also establishing more strategic relationships. We see our sales clearly as a total solution provider which includes products and services primarily supported and provided by our well educated salesforce.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Thank you, Michel.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Then maybe if I could just follow up with maybe one item here. Dominic, if I look at the breadth of J&J, everybody looks at it right now and says the pharma business looks fantastic. You have got some product launches that are driving very strong growth and you are lapping up more that are coming shortly, so I think everybody is very comfortable with performance of pharma business and the outlook of the next, say, let's call it two or three years at a minimum.","The challenges on the other side of the business within MD&D consumers, let me spend just a minute on consumer. If we stripped out and looked at the rest of the portfolio, the rest of the portfolio is growing 0% to 1% for last several quarters, but it doesn't seems like it has really picked up even as the economy has got in little bit better, so can you just talk a little bit about the strategy for the balance of the consumer business and is there any potential for growth to be accelerated for the broader portfolio?","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Mike. Well, let say the consumer business has had as you know some challenges related to the overall economic slowdown, and yes you did comment and we do see some pickup in overall economic activity, but certainly not to the level that we all hope it would be at, so there are still some carryover elements of trading down, if you will, store brands and the like and what's incumbent upon our business then is to create the innovations that consumers will want and purchase and remain loyal to.","You see that in certain pockets of our business more than others quite frankly. For example in skin care, AVEENO products are doing extremely well. You see new advertising campaigns et cetera and AVEENO alone is up 16% year-over-year. In other elements of the business, we have proved our portfolio quite frankly, we have had the impact of divestitures that have shown - made the difficulty in comparing the progress year-over-year, but we are poised to continue to capture market share through innovation which has been our stronghold in the consumer business in addition obviously to focusing on the return of OTC business.","Just to mention one other thing about consumer, our emerging markets in the consumer business continue to do well despite some slowdown in some of these emerging markets we were confident that that consumer business will continue to do well and show growth as those consumers begin to purchase more personal care products in the future, so we are happy with the progress to-date. I think, we still have little bit ways to go with some innovation, but we have been very fortunate with the level of innovation we have been able to deliver thus far and I am confident we will see more coming in the near-term.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for taking my question. Dominic, I know you had mentioned with the completion of the ASR program that you are going to be resuming your normal share repurchases to offset the employee stock issuance. I was just wondering if you could take a step back and maybe give us some of your broader thoughts on just capital allocation at this point. I guess why not doing more significant stock purchases given your net cash balance?","Michel Orsinger","Kristen thanks for the question. Well, we have consistently addressed this question in a way that I think investors have come to understand our approach to capital allocation which is first and foremost we are going to generate strong cash flows. After that, we are very proud of having a 51-year history of increasing our dividend and so we have a priority towards allocating capital to our dividend which has proven to be the most enduring return to capital that we have looked at over long periods of time compared to other companies in the industry. Then we would like to continue to increase our presence in the global healthcare market by doing smart acquisitions at the right time with the right value for shareholders, which in the end continues to give us the ability to generate even stronger cash flows for the long-term.","Then finally in order of priority, we look at share repurchases primarily as an offset to any dilution we might incur. For example, in the Synthes transaction, we completely offset that dilution of the employee stock purchases. We also obviously continue to offset that dilution, so that's the order in which we think of capital allocation to the extent we are opportunistic at times to buy back stock. We will always entertain that possibility, but that's been our approach and we think it has served us well and will continue to serve us well and our shareholder for the long-term.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then just thinking about Synthes and some of the assumptions that you guys had at the time of acquisition. I know the growth forecast is a little bit softer now relative to back then. I think trauma and spine were expected to grow somewhere between 5% and 7%. I think today on the slides you guys have showed now globally orthopedic, closer to 2% to 4%. How do you guys just think about, I guess some of the cost synergies that you had originally targeted? How are those tracking? And are there greater opportunities on the cost side to maybe offset maybe at little bit lower sales growth contribution from the acquisition?","Dominic Caruso","Right. Thanks, Kris. Let me just address that and then ask Michel if he would like to add anything. You are absolutely right. The major difference between the time of the acquisition and now is the growth rate primarily in trauma. Trauma as you know, was growing at that point 6%, 7% and you saw from Michel's discussion what we expect the growth rate to be going forward. So that's a major change in assumptions.","We think that in order to answer that challenge we will have to do two things. Michel talked about the first being making sure that we have a comprehensive offering with the breadth of our portfolio et cetera. Secondly we will have to look at cost. However, you will remember that the major purpose of this acquisition was not to drive our cost synergies. It was to, as Michel mentioned, number one, preserve and then enhance the experience with our customers. But given the realities of the marketplace, we will look at, in fact, at what's an appropriate level of cost structure should be lower level of market growth remain for extended periods of time.","But Michel, anything else you would add to that?","Michel Orsinger","Indeed, Dominic. The emphasis we have is on growth but considering the new market environment over the last two years, it's a relative growth to the market which our people feel accountable to. Related to cost synergies we see nevertheless attractive opportunities to further realize and within our integration efforts, I must say, that at least the internally defined growth and cost synergies are on target.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Dominic and one for Michel. Starting with Dominic, you gave some color on the call on your BRIC market growth, but I don't think you gave for overall J&J. I think it was 19% in the second quarter. Can you give us that number for the third quarter and just the near-term outlook, Dominic there, given the issues in China? And if you could just talk about any impact in China across the three segments from the recent years? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Right. Well, we did see an overall slower level of market growth in China most recently but let me just give you an idea of year-to-date through the nine months if you exclude Synthes from the numbers because obviously they impact the comparison for last year. We have double-digit growth across the BRIC markets, over 10%. Somewhere near 11%, 12% combined in the BRIC markets.","So I think that's pretty healthy growth considering the relative slowdown that we have most recently are seen. We still believe the BRIC markets will be a major contributor of our growth going forward across all three of our major segments, MD&D, consumer and pharma as well.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks for that. And then Michel, I am sure people would love to hear you your reaction to the Stryker-MAKO deal? And just lastly, it seems like the large joint market improved in the third quarter based on the two companies as reported so far in the U.S. Would you agree with that? If so why? Thanks.","Michel Orsinger","Thank you for the question. First of all related to robotics. I think it's important to put it the question in to context of enabling technologies. There are many ways to improve the surgical processes and such enables our computer data territory, patient specific instrumentation, sensors and enabling technology in today's environment, in my opinion, must consider in a balanced way outcomes, efficiency and costs.","So robotics, in its current stage, based on my information has not yet been proven that it is the best solution to address all of these criteria in a holistic way. It has theoretical incremental improvement in surgical accuracy but with increased significant surgical time and capital cost. Longer-term, robotic technology could have a role in facilitating less invasive patient customized implants and to proceeded solutions, so we continue to monitor this technology with great interest. Our focus is currently on procedure and episode of care efficiency. For example through our TruMatch and Care4Today where we think there are much more fundamental advantages to be gained.","Related to your second question, I can confirm your statement. We also believe that joint in the third quarter has at least maintained momentum if not picked up. We see an overall very attractive performance from DePuy Synthes recon with plus 7%. I am confident although we still have to wait until other major players report their quarterly results, I am confident that that DePuy Synthes has gained share in the third quarter and that would mean that we have done so in its fifth consecutive quarter.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Good morning, Louise, and thank you very much for your time. Two questions, Dominic, the first or may be both of you. One is around free cash flow or cash flow from operations, however you wish to address it. Correct me if am wrong, I believe in the second quarter as you mentioned that the second half of this year, cash flow from operations would be greater. If am incorrect, I apologize for that, but the most important question is, regardless of how you view it. Do you have a view at which point cash flow growth can actually be something similar to the net income growth that you have actually been demonstrating quarter-in quarter-out just based upon at least pharma and to some degree the turnaround in consumer?","The second, more product-specific question, is around abiraterone, and clearly very strong sequential growth is all that growth coming from the pre-chemo market or can you comment, or are you able to providing the split about whether the growth is ex or pre-chemo and why is it post-chemo? Thanks very much.","Michel Orsinger","Sure, Tony. Well, let's see. Let's talk about free cash flow and just for purposes of definition that's cash flow from operation less capital expenditures. That's the way we look at free cash flow and that has consistently been very strong at Johnson & Johnson and this year is no exception to that. Last year, we reported free cash flow in excess of $12 billion. We expect that this year's free cash flow will be greater than that.","With respect to the relationship of free cash flow, the earnings, many of the special charges that we have talked about are in fact non-cash special charges right now. If you look at our earnings in comparison to free cash flow, what you will find is that generally speaking Johnson & Johnson has always delivered free cash flow in the aggregate that's somewhere in the neighborhood of 95% to 105% or just about equal to the net earnings that the company generates on an annual basis, so that has to do with our ability to manage receivables, inventory and appropriately invest in capital, so a very strong cash flow indeed and that's a credit to all the men and women that operate and run our businesses throughout the world where they do pay attention for the level of free cash flow that's generated, because that of course is the fuel for us to invest further in our business.","With respect to abiraterone or ZYTIGA pre-chemo versus chemo, Louise was able to look that up for us, so let me just turn it over to Louise for that answer.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Tony, the split of sales in the U.S. is roughly 55% naive and 45% refractory in the quarter. If you look at the market growth, the market growth in the quarter was 24.5% for that total market, refractory grew about 26.5% and naive about 23.5%. We actually grew share also in a total market going to 33% up from 30.6% and the refractory market you see a slight dip at that 55% from 55.4%, because of the new competition but you see nice growth in the naive market 24.6%, up from 21%.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Thank you, Louise.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of questions for Dominic. First, Dominic, one of the areas that J&J is not currently participating in is structural heart. There is a lot of interest in it. Just broadly speaking, do you guys feel that expectations are overhyped that they are assets to be had that are of interest or what's the general level of interest on the part of J&J in that space?","Michel Orsinger","Well, Tony, the structural heart ware or cardiovascular devices in general are of interest to Johnson & Johnson with the exception of the stent market which, Bruce, we have exited. So we do view structural heart as an attractive market. It is true, however, that whenever we look at acquisitions we look to acquire assets at a price that we believe will generate value for our shareholders. So to the extent that valuations are a bit inflated, we would rather wait and approach that market when valuations come, in our view, better in line, Bruce. So that's the way we look at it. So of interest to us but we will watch valuations carefully before acting.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","And my follow-on is about XARELTO. What's your view of the prospects for maintaining leadership in that category in the U.S.? Secondly how do you scale the ACS opportunity within the overall opportunity in the U.S.? Thanks so much.","Michel Orsinger","Well, Bruce, the main strategy with XARELTO has been and continues to work well for us and that is that the breadth of clinical indications and support for the product is really unparalleled in the marketplace, in addition to the convenience of the once-daily dosage. So we have see steady growth in XARELTO, new to brand share in particular with cardiologist and even with primary care physicians, primarily because of the breadth of the clinical data despite the fact that there has been much competition entering the marketplace but that competition just doesn't have the breadth of clinical data that we have with XARELTO. So that's been our strategy. I credit our cardiovascular therapeutic area team for developing that strategy and it's working really well. So I expect we will continue to be leaders in this marketplace.","ACS just adds to the total package of clinical data which our experience is that that gives physicians, cardiologists, et cetera just more confidence in the utilization of that compound given the fact that it's been extensively studied. We look forward to see what the FDA responses with respect to our new submission for ACS. But we think that will add to the breadth of good clinical data which has been, I think, the main driver of the growth of the product.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning, Jami.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning. Just two questions for you, Dominic. The first is in Simeprevir. I know that goes before a panel, I believe next week. I am just wondering how we should think it will be used? Do you expect it to be used as part of an all oral regimen beginning in 2014 with Gilead's Sofo or do you expect it's use to be limited to peg riba? My second question is more of a strategy question and, I think, dovetails with some of the earlier questions on this call and that is, clearly pharma has been the key driver of growth for the past couple of years now. I am just wondering what your plans are to unleashed that value which, clearly I think, has been hidden by the continued under performance of MD&D and consumer. Clearly the market is paying up for independent asset showing the type of growth that we are seeing in your pharma business. I am just wondering how you are thinking about that now. I know we have discussed this repeatedly in the past but I think this continues to be the case? Thanks.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Jami. Well, with simeprevir, it would be premature to comment too much before the panel meeting because obviously the utilization of the compound will be somewhat dependent on the label that eventually is granted by the FDA. We do think it's a very potent protease inhibitor and as you know, we have studied the compound in addition to the single indication that we are now in waiting for FDA approval on. We have studied it in combination with other compounds including Gilead's compound and others, both NS5As and nukes.","Our strategy has been to develop the most potent protease inhibitor and combine it with other compounds in the marketplace and now I am please to remind you that we have just acquired our own NS5A with our acquisition of the compound from GlaxoSmithKline, so obviously we will now develop a combination of our own, but to comment any further about the actual utilization would be premature for the label and the outcome.","With respect to unlocking value, you are right. We have talked about this many times. You have also heard us describe our approach to healthcare as a comprehensive approach having a broad base in healthcare. We believe that that is the best strategy for the long-term to deliver both, innovation and breadth of business and solutions for the healthcare marketplace. We believe we are best positioned by having a combined set of businesses that we currently have and we think that investors and others that follow us very closely understand the composition of our business and can certainly do a very fair some of the parts analysis by looking at the combination of each of the businesses and the appropriate growth rates and above market quite frankly multiples that we think businesses like our Pharma business deserve, so it's all readily available and easily done and we think the long-term strategy is one that's sound and we continue to subscribe to having a broad base of healthcare businesses to be most competitive in the marketplace for the long-term.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Good morning, everybody. Dominic just a few gross margins, you know we are almost back of the 70% gross margin what we saw throughout much of changes last decade and I assume that the third quarter gross margin performance was driven by the excellent pharma results, which seemed pretty sustainable. Knowing how focused you are personally on driving efficiencies throughout the organization broadly, Dominic can we assume that that kind of gross margin performances we saw that for closer to that 70%, level of sustainable basis that's closer hand that maybe we would appreciate it and maybe you could expand on your comments on the positive mixed cost improvement in the third quarter specifically?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well, the comparison to last year's third quarter just to be clear, last year's third quarter included the step up in inventory values from the acquisition of Synthes, so you see it 2.5 or 250 basis points improvement year-over-year and about 100 basis points is due to the non-repeat of the step-up in inventory values as that's now flushed out of the system, but the rest of it a 150 basis points is primarily due to the mix of the business, with pharma driving most of the growth. Pharma is in fact the highest gross margin business for us, but in addition to that we have seen good cost containment and cost efficiencies in our MD&D business. Of course as we continue to remediate under consent decree, we will obviously over time show improvements in gross margin from current levels to future in our consumer business.","Now having said that, our supply chain strategy is a long term strategy. We have been added now for a couple of years and it includes reciting and redistributing where the products are manufactured. That takes time, Rick, to implement, but we are obviously off to a good start and we expect we will continue to generate cost efficiencies within the supply chain over an appropriate level of time given the regulatory requirement et cetera for reciting products, so we are off to a good start. We are very proud of it and thanks for pointing it out.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Great. Just a thought, but quick one for you and Michel. I was at (Inaudible) last week and several CEOs suggested that maybe they were seeing some stronger procedure growth in the second half as folks do more procedures ahead of 2014 January 01 that's what we said and constantly changing insurance coverage. Do you think you are seeing any benefits, Michel? Dominic, feel free to chime in and maybe talk a little bit, Michel, about the ATTUNE impact. I assume, as a result of these kinds of launches, it takes off gradually. Are you where you hope to be? Just where are we in the ATTUNE launch?","Michel Orsinger","Okay, first of all related to spine. My takeaway from that was, in general, stakeholders are expecting more and more evidence. We might see some uplift in the fourth quarter from a market point of view, people who have been delaying and may use that co-payment earlier year might finally decide to go for surgeries.","ATTUNE. We are on track related to ATTUNE. Very important to us. All the clinical outcomes, which are very good. Surgeon's acceptance to try the product are also very good. So we are in the midst of launching not only now in the U.S., but expanding into Europe and eventually Asia-Pacific.","The key question, in my opinion, will be how much of our volume goes into current customers versus how much we give to new customers to convert and this is a balance our sales force needs to tackle. But so far, we are very confident that ATTUNE will have a good impact worldwide within the next two to three years.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Thank you.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.","Louise Mehrotra","Good morning.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One for Michel and then one for Dominic. First, Michel. One of the longer term concerns that investors have had about the ortho market has been the potential for a generic or value segment offering to really penetrate and destroy pricing in the marketplace. The kind of the comments that you made on trauma are the first that I think we have really heard that. Maybe this is having some sort of a near term impact now and I just wanted to get your comments on your view of whether or not you can, the value segment offering is something that's here to stay in the U.S. and if there is potential that it might spread from trauma to hips to knees to spine and what the impact of that might be on the markets long-term?","Michel Orsinger","Thank you. Certainly the healthcare landscape is changing big time. And as mentioned before, all stakeholders are looking forward continuing to improve patient outcome but also to increase patient satisfaction and do that at reduced cost. While the landscape is changing, we see emerging decision makers like the providers, either CEOs of the hospital of groups and having had the opportunity to meet many of them over the last few months, there is a demand for value creation, there is a demand for transforming the healthcare delivery system and there is a demand to collaborate with larger companies.","Scale, in the sense of DePuy Synthes, but also leveraging other opportunities within MD&D and within even other Johnson & Johnson portfolios will give us the opportunity to work at a much higher strategic level with providers and, yes, provide more cost effective procedures, products but also services to ensure that this more total oriented solution and not just focused on products, will provide a relevant add on solution to every single stakeholder. So we are confident that, now, being part of J&J but combining those two companies, we can leverage breadth of the portfolio, scale and this is what matters more than ever before to the healthcare providers and payers, by the way.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","But do you, Michel, feel that the value segment in the U.S. is here to stay in ortho and continue to grow from here?","Michel Orsinger","It depends how you define value segment. We define it as providing healthcare in a more effective way and this is not just focused on the product. This is not just focused on the price. You have to look at the whole continuum. The patient goes through a process. We are developing new programs and services to educate the patient, working with providers and clinicians to have protocols with standardized procedures but eventually also a company there the patients and the families in the rehab post operatively. And this is what we see as a better value offering, a more relevant offering and not just focused on pricing and discounting.","The discussions will continue obviously to deal on pricing, but we have now being part of a larger company DePuy Synthes and J&J, the unique opportunity to again leverage size and scale and create beyond product innovation service and program innovation which will create value, so in that sense the Value segment is becoming more holistic, more complex, but representing a great opportunity for us.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thank you, Michel, understood. Dominic, just quickly, I was wondering if you could comment on the progress of the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics divestiture and where you are there in and I appreciate that you may not be able to give us direct answer on the actual status, but more importantly when you think about the proceeds that might be generated from that transaction in the future, do those come back to shareholders, do they get reinvested? Can you give us a sense for what you might do there? Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Derrick. Well, with respect to the strategic the evaluation of strategic options for Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, we said it would take a 12-month to 24-month period. We announced that in January. We are progressing well, it's on track. We are moving through the process. Things are moving along well, so we are progressing as planned. It's premature to give you any more insight in to that. Then obviously, whenever we do finally complete the analysis and make a decision, but I think it would be premature to comment, part of that what we do with the proceeds, but when we are talk about obviously we will update investors at that time.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for taking the question. Dominic, I wanted to ask about understanding that you can't provide specific 2014 guidance, but over the last few quarters pharma has been a big driver of the top line and I suspect bottom line outperformance. You know, as we come up on anniversarying that strong performance, potential competition for our recent new product launches our ramping competition there, how do we think about where the next leg of growth is going to come for J&J overall in the near to medium-term?","Dominic Caruso","Sure. Well. Each of the businesses have a substantial innovations that they are launching plans for 2014 and beyond to launch substantial innovations across every one of our businesses. Pharma, you are right, has experienced substantial growth as a result of new product launches, but those product launches are just beginning. They have taken hold now and we think they will continue to do well. Then new products, as you have seen us develop our strategy of continuing to in-license new products and launching those into the marketplace successfully, I think you will continue to see us do that, so I think each one of our businesses has a set of innovation that we plan to launch and each of the businesses should contribute to the growth going forward.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","Okay. Great. Thanks. Then within the Medical Devices business in particular, one of your competitors has recently talked more about sort of viewing the device business more holistically providing full solutions to the hospital. Do you have any perspectives on that and how you think the healthcare environment will change as it relates to that and where J&J stands with that any perspective there would be helpful? Thanks so much.","Dominic Caruso","Sure, Danielle. Well, Michel talked a great length about that with respect to the orthopedics business and I would like to ask Michel to comment further, because he's involved across the broad spectrum of Johnson & Johnson's Medical Devices businesses as well, but we see it as an important characteristic in the marketplace and one in which scale and breadth and the power of Johnson & Johnson should serve us well. Certainly, there is very few companies that can match our scale and breadth in dealing with the comprehensive offering to the hospitals.","Michel has been there on the frontlines with hospital CEOs and talking about the breadth and scale of Johnson & Johnson even beyond orthopedic, so I am sure Michel you could add a few comments as well.","Michel Orsinger","Yes. Indeed, the key goal in our discussions with key partners is, how we could provide value in form of more holistic solutions. So far the industry has been very much focused on surgeons and patients, obviously, delivering good clinical outcomes. Now the healthcare delivery system needs to find new ways to do so in a more cost effective way. Hence we are driving now not only a strong R&D pipeline but a pipeline of new programs and services, collaborating together with the partners. We don't have all the answers today. But we understand more and more of their needs.","So elevating our relationship to more a strategic partnership with the providers in providing more holistic solutions. And maybe one more word, a key advantage we have, beside our already really relevant critical size within DePuy and Synthes, talking about MD&D, more and more we find new ways to collaborate, for example, with Global Surgery,","who offer complementary products for one and the same procedure. So a procedure based approach give us as also opportunity to combine co-solutions from different pockets of the industry.","Louise Mehrotra","We will take two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First, Dominic, the number of selling days. Any changes in the number of selling days this quarter? Then I wanted to just follow up quickly on a pricing question.","Dominic Caruso","Glenn, good morning. I don't think the number of selling days is very significant this quarter versus last. I wouldn't attribute any of the change to selling days.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and then second on pricing. You called out pricing several times on the device side particularly knees and hips as well as spine. So one, can you tell me has pricing got worse or is it just the same type of pressure? Then Louise, some times you give us pricing in knees, hips and spines. I wondered if you can do that for us?","Dominic Caruso","So let me just give you overall. We expected at the beginning of the year that pricing would be a headwind for us this year of about 50 basis points in operating margin. We still think that's the case now that we are nine months through the year. Pricing is in fact an overall headwind for the business in total. And Louise, specifically for these orthopedics.","Louise Mehrotra","So this is U.S. only. So price in hips is down about 3% in the quarter. We have a positive mix about 1.5%. So a net of negative 1.5% price mix for the hips in U.S. And as far as knees, price is down about 1.5%, mix up about 1%.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","And do you have that for spine as well?","Louise Mehrotra","I do. So price for spine down about 4% in the quarter with a negative mix of about 0.5%. So close to about 4.5% negative in terms of price mix for spine, U.S. U.S. only, again.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you, Louise.","Louise Mehrotra","Last question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Dominic Caruso","Hi, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick questions. One, Dominic, I just wanted to confirm something I heard earlier. I think you said in Q2 that BRIC growth for J&J was 19% and I think you said in Q3 it was 11%, 12%. Is that correct?","Dominic Caruso","Well, no, Bob. I didn't say that. I think the person asking the question was stating comments about the growth in the second quarter. I commented on year-to-date through nine months, the BRIC growth excluding Synthes, because that's very important to exclude Synthes in the analysis, is 11% to 12% overall for Johnson & Johnson in the BRIC markets excluding Synthes.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay, and then so it sounds like things are a little slower in Q3 which is, I guess, not surprising. Was there any one division where that was more pronounced than another?","Dominic Caruso","Well a little slower overall but I don't know that I would point any one particular division versus another. I mean there's dynamics in the China marketplace each and every quarter. So I would just say on an overall basis greater than 10% growth is, we are pretty happy with that growth and I think it will do. It will continue to be a major driver of growth for us but what we are seeing is double-digit growth in the BRIC marketplaces but a little lower than what everyone else has previously commented on as an expectation for BRIC growth of maybe mid-teens. We see it's a little bit slower than that now.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay, and then lastly, for Michel. Any of the comments on the hip market, in your comments do you feel like you are taking share and have been taking share over the last couple of quarters. I was just wondering is that a general comment, because especially around Q3, because you don't see the rest of the market growing at the same rate as you are, or was there something specific about a specific competitor that you are referring to in terms of your commentary around Q3 market share?","Michel Orsinger","I attribute our Q3 performance primarily to good portfolio mix in the U.S. primarily driven by Corail\/TRI-LOCK and Pinnacle Acetabular Cup System. I attribute it to a very focused strategy, by the way well executed by the sales force and last but not least by a solid leadership. No major changes in my opinion related to competition. Good execution by DePuy Synthes.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you. We will have some final comments from Dominic.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. Thanks Michel for joining us today and thanks Louise. Well, we are very pleased with our quarterly results and our progress this year in advancing our near-term priorities of returning to a reliable supply of OTC products to the market, successfully integrating Synthes and building on the momentum of our newly launched pharmaceutical products. We are doing all of this while continuing to deliver strong financial results and developing longer term strategies to drive growth in this dynamic global healthcare market, where we are focused on addressing the critical unmet healthcare needs of patients and consumers.","I would like to, again, thank the people of Johnson & Johnson for their dedication and commitment, and I look forward to updating you on our full year results, our outlook for 2014 and our strategic priorities along with our CEO, Alex Gorsky, when we meet in January. Thanks again for your time this morning and have a great day, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson third quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

I am Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2013. Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Sandy Peterson, Group Worldwide Chairman and Dominic Caruso, Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I will begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the second quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments.","Following my remarks, Alex will provide some additional commentary on our results and an update on our near term priorities and Sandy will provide an update on our consumer business and our global supply chain. Please note, the presentation for the company's, Sandy's and Alex's remarks are available on our website. Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the financial results and guidance for 2013.","We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one and a half hour. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and\/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release.","Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online.","During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.","Now, we would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled, supplementary sales data by geographic area. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.9 billion for the second quarter of 2013, up 8.5% as compared to the second quarter of 2012. On an operational basis, sales were up 10% and currency had a negative impact of 1.5%.","In the U.S., sales were up 8%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 11.8%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our recorded results by 2.8 points. Sales included the impact of the acquisition of Synthes, net of the divestiture of the DePuy trauma business. Excluding this impact, worldwide operational sales growth was 5.6%.","The western hemisphere, excluding the U.S. grew by 14% operationally while Europe grew 11.4% on an operational basis. Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 11% operationally. The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made strong contributions to the results in all regions.","If you will now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. Net earnings were $3.8 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the same period in 2012. Earnings per share were $1.33 versus $0.50 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As a reference to the accompanying table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2013 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude special items related to increases in litigation expense accrual, integration and transaction cost related to the acquisition of Synthes and cost associated with the DePuy ASR Hip program.","Second quarter 2012 net earnings included after-tax special items of approximately $2.2 billion as shown in the accompanying reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.48, representing increases of 17.7% and 13.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2012.","I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move onto the segment highlights. For the second quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 30.7% was down 50 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due mix, lower cost associated with strong volume growth in our pharmaceutical business and cost improvement initiatives across all the businesses. This was partially offset by incremental amortization expense related to Synthes of approximately $140 million, or 80 basis points and the impact of the medical device excise tax.","Second quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 30.1% of sales consistent with our 2012 results. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.9%, up 20 basis points due to milestone payments.","Interest expense net of interest income of $101 million was down $28 million versus the second quarter of 2012, due to a lower average debt level. Other expense, net of other income was $172 million in the second quarter of 2013, compared to $2 billion in the same period last year.","Excluding special items, other income net of other expense of $394 million was $220 million favorable compared to 2012, the gain on sale of the ECHELON investment is reflected in this amount.","Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 20% in the second quarter of 2013, compared to 21.6% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide commentary on taxes in his remarks.","Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the second quarter of 2013. I will begin with the consumer segment.","Worldwide consumer segment sales for the second quarter of 2013 of $3.7 billion, increased 1.1% as compared to the same period, last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 1.7%, while the impact of currency was negative 0.6% U.S. sales were up 1%, while international sales grew 2% on an operational basis.","Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions operational growth was approximately 2.5%. Baby Care products increased on an operational basis by 3.1% when compared to the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to hair care and cleansers. Sales in the Oral Care business increased operationally 0.2%. Results were driven by strong international sales of LISTERINE, due to the continued success of new product launches partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of manual toothbrushes in North America.","Beginning this quarter, we are reporting OTC Pharmaceuticals separately and have moved Nutritionals to the other line. To assist in updating your models, a summary under the new format is included in the sales schedule that accompany the press release.","For the second quarter of 2013, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals increased 5.4% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2012. U.S. sales were up 17.4% driven by strong growth in analgesics and other key brands as we continue to make progress in returning a reliable supply products to the marketplace.","International sales were up 0.9% operationally. Our Skin Care business was down 0.4% on an operational basis in the second quarter of 2013. Strong results for [renal] were offset by the impact of divestitures. Excluding divestitures, operational growth was approximately 1%.","Women's health grew 3.6% on an operational basis due to strong growth in women's sanitary protection products. Wound Care other sales decreased 4.3% on an operational basis, impacted by competitive pressures as well as a divestiture and nutritionals.","That completes the review of the Consumer segment, and I will now review highlights for the pharmaceutical segment.","Worldwide net sales for the second quarter of $7 billion increased 11.7% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 12.9% with a negative currency impact of 1.2 points. Sales in the U.S. increased 9.1%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 16.5%.","Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas. Immunology products were 17.6% operationally, with sales in the U.S. up 7.3% and sales outside the U.S. up 51.5% operationally. During the quarter, the company made certain supply chain changes from for REMICADE, resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. exports sales now being international sales. Adjusting for this impact, the U.S. immunology growth was approximately 14% with REMICADE excluding expert sales up approximately 4%, SIMPONI up 38.1% and STELARA up 53.3%. Results were driven by market growth across the major products, complemented by increased market share for both STELARA and SIMPONI.","With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology. Adjusted immunology sales outside the U.S. increased by over 25% operationally, with REMICADE up approximately 20% due to strong growth in Canada and the emerging markets including a tender shipment. STELARA made significant contributions due to market share gains and market growth across the major regions, while very strong growth in Japan drove the results for SIMPONI.","Sales of infectious disease products increased 23.9% on an operational basis. INCIVO, a treatment for Hepatitis C grew 71.8% on an operational basis due to the success of the continued rollout most notably in Latin America as well as a shipment for tender business. Continued momentum in market share growth of PREZISTA made notable contributions to the results as did the combined sales of COMPLERA and EDURANT.","Neuroscience product sales increased 0.4% operationally. U.S. sales declined 4.9% impacted by generic competition primarily for CONCERTA. The long-acting injectable antipsychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved operational growth of approximately 15% due to an increase in combined market share.","Sales of oncology products increased 53.2% on an operational basis due to the very strong results for ZYTIGA and VELCADE. ZYTIGA is now approved to treat both chemo refractory and chemo na\u00efve metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of 70% with U.S. sales growing 54% due to very strong market growth of over 20% and increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer market. ZYTIGA has captured over 30% of that market and is up approximately 3.5 points sequentially. Operational sales outside the U.S. grew 85.2% versus second quarter 2012 and on a sequential basis, ZYTIGA was up over 20%. Additional country rollouts and the expansion of the label to chemo na\u00efve patients drove the strong results. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries.","VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 22.7% on an operational basis. Strong performance in patient share in the frontline setting and the launch of the subcutaneous version continue to drive sales growth.","Other oncology increased primarily due to DOXIL\/CAELYX. Other pharmaceutical products declined 2.7% on an operational basis with lower sales for ACIPHEX and PARIET, related primarily to generic competition. PROCRIT sales declined 18.1%, due primarily to a market decline. Positively impacting results, XARELTO sales grew over 20% on a sequential basis capturing nearly 39% of new to brand scripts in cardiology, surpassing warfarin. Total prescription share in the broader anticoagulant market grew 1.7 points on a sequential basis to 7.4%.","As an update on the pipeline, during the quarter, in immunology the FDA approved SIMPONI for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and the EMA application for SIMPONI IV for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA was resubmitted. In infectious diseases, a marketing authorization application was submitted to the European Medicines Agency seeking approval for simeprevir for Hepatitis C, and it was granted U.S. priority review status by the FDA with a PDUFA in late November. The European Commission approved a new twice daily dosing for INCIVO. In neuroscience, regarding bapineuzumab, JANSSEN Alzheimer Immunotherapy and its alliance partner Pfizer have decided to discontinue development of the subcutaneous formulation.","Studies with other compounds in earlier stages of development in the alliance portfolio are ongoing and future development strategies will be discussed jointly by the alliance partners. We remain committed to our efforts to discover and develop promising new treatments for people with Alzheimer's disease.","Regarding the stent thrombosis sNDA for XARELTO, a complete response letter was received from the FDA. We remain confident in the results of the ATLAS ACS trial and are in ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding this sNDA.","In oncology, Breakthrough Therapy Designation for daratumumab, for the treatment of certain patients with multiple myeloma was granted by the FDA and the positive opinion from the European authorities on two variations relating to the use of VELCADE were received.","The first recommendations for the use of VELCADE as retreatment in adult who had previously responded to the treatment with the same medicine, the second recommendation was for using induction combination therapy for certain adult patients. And, ibrutinib was submitted to the FDA for use in the treatment of previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or CLL, and small lymphocytic lymphoma or SLL and for its use in treatment of previously treated patients with mantle cell lymphoma or MCL.","That completes the review of the Pharmaceutical segment. I will now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $7.2 billion grew 12% operationally as compared to the same period in 2012.","Currency had a negative impact of 2.4 points resulting in a total sales increase of 9.6%. Sales excluding the net impact of Synthes were up 0.5% on an operational basis, with U.S. sales down 3.3% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.5% on an operational basis. Adjusted for divestitures and exits from certain businesses, underlying growth was approximately 1.5%, reflecting continued market and pricing pressures. I will provide more commentary on these factors in the franchise reviews.","Now, turning to the MD&D businesses starting with, Cardiovascular Care. Cardiovascular Care sales were up 7.7% operationally, with U.S. up 4.6% and sales outside the U.S. up 9.6%, operationally, driven by Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business with worldwide operational growth of over 16% in the quarter.","The success of a number of catheter launches made strong contributions to the results. The Diabetes Care business operational sales declined 11.8% in the second quarter of 2013 with U.S. business down 23.1%, due to the impact of lower price, competitive pressures and softness in the retail market. The business outside the U.S. was down 0.5%, operationally, with strong growth in the emerging markets offset by lower sales in many of the developed markets.","The Diagnostics business declined 4% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of divestitures of RhoGAM and Theracos businesses operational sales grew approximately 2.5%, primarily due to growth and donors screening in the U.S. and emerging markets outside the U.S.","Infection Prevention increased 5.2% on an operational basis, with sales in the U.S. down 4% due to lower sales of capital equipment. Outside the U.S. operational growth of 12.3% was driven by both, consumables and capital item sales.","Orthopedic sales were up 48.9% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2012. Excluding the net impact of Synthes, operational sales were up approximately 3% with U.S. up approximately 2% and outside the U.S. up approximately 3.5%, operationally.","Operationally, Hips were up 4% worldwide driven by 5% growth in the U.S., due to strong results in primary stent platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were up 4% on an operational basis, driven mainly by heads and acetabular products.","Knees worldwide increased 2% on an operational basis with the U.S. up 3% driven by the ATTUNE fixed bearing knee as well as revision platforms offset by lower sales of rotating platforms. Sales outside the U.S. were up 1%. Including the Synthes business in both periods and excluding the divested DePuy trauma business in both periods, trauma grew approximately 4% on an operational basis due to both, new products and stronger underlying demand.","Growth in the U.S. was 2% and 7%, operational outside the U.S. Including the Synthes business in both periods, worldwide spine was down 2% on an operational basis, with U.S. down approximately 7%, impacted by continued softness in the market, as well as the impact of the attrition of the commercial sales organization as we integrate the businesses. Outside the U.S., sales were up approximately 6% operationally with strong growth in Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific.","Specialty surgery operational growth was 2.8% in the second quarter of 2013. U.S. Sales were down 1.5% and sales outside the U.S. were up 7.5% on an operational basis. Strong sales of balloon sinuplasty products from Acclarent and biosurgical products were partially offset by lower sales of Mentor products due to competitive and pricing pressures. Sales of energy products were flat on an operational basis with new product launches and continued penetration driving strong sales outside the U.S. offset by softer sales of HARMONIC products in the U.S. Surgical care worldwide sales were down 1.2% on an operational basis with the U.S. down 4.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 0.6% operationally.","Negatively impacting growth were divestitures and business exits. Excluding these items, the underlying business was flat with lower sales of women's health and urology offset by strong demand for endocutter products, with the ECHELON FLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler.","Rounding out the review, the medical devices and diagnostics segment, our Vision Care business achieved operational sales growth of 5.4% in the second quarter with the U.S. up 3.6% and sales outside the U.S. up 6.4% operationally. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses. That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson second quarter of 2013.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Well, hello everyone and thank you, Louise, and thanks to everyone for joining us on this call today. Now it is really my pleasure to review our results for the first half of the year and also the progress we made under near-term priorities. Now, you recall, in January, that I discussed the framework for managing our business. The success of our enterprise is built first on Our Credo, which unites Johnson & Johnson as a global enterprise. Our strategic operating principles continue to service well in the evolving marketplace and with our four growth drivers, we have a sound approach to sustaining and driving growth in today's dynamic global healthcare environment.","At the mid-year point, we have achieved strong growth across our enterprise. A year ago, our team established a set of critical near-term priorities for moving the business forward. As part of our commitment to keeping you appraised of how we are doing against them, I am pleased to say that with the laser focus approach we have taken, we have made solid demonstrable progress in delivering on our financial commitments, restoring a reliable supply of OTC products to consumers, continuing the successful integration of Synthes and building on the strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business.","Reflecting our broad base of leadership in healthcare, we have generated sales of $35.4 billion thus far in 2013, up a strong 9.9% operationally versus this time a year ago, 4.8% operationally, excluding the net impact of Synthes. Medical devices and diagnostics represents 40% of our total sales, generating $14.3 billion in sales year-to-date. Sales grew 12% operationally driven by the positive growth contribution of the Synthes acquisition.","Excluding Synthes, overall growth in this segment was impacted by portfolio decisions to divest and exit certain businesses as well as the continued economic and pricing pressures within these markets. Underlying growth was essentially flat year-to-date. With $13.8 billion, the pharmaceutical segment represented 39% of our total sales and has continued its strong momentum reporting operational growth of 12.1%. Our consumer segment generated 21% of our total sales at $7.3 billion in revenue at an operational growth rate of 2.4%.","Now as the global economy evolves, more people are entering the middle-class in emerging markets and increasing demands on the healthcare system. As I outlined at our year-end earnings meeting in January, we are investing in growth and expansion in the broader emerging markets by leveraging our strong iconic brands as well as acquiring market specific products and to-date they account for nearly a quarter of our sales. As a subset of the emerging markets, we are also seeing growth in the brick nations, which account for approximately 10% of our overall sales this year.","We are encouraged by the double-digit growth rates we are seeing in these countries driven by our core pharmaceutical and the Indian consumer brands as well as the complementary acquisitions we have made in Russia and China. As our global reach with local focus, strategy for driving growth matures, we will overtime be introducing more products that will increase options for consumers in these fast-growing parts of the world.","Moving now to the segment highlights. I will start with pharmaceuticals. Our pharmaceutical segment continues to drive robust growth by delivering meaningful innovations that will improve patient care, demonstrating the effect of the transformation we made in this segment. I am very proud of the accomplishments that our pharma team has exhibited in this process.","Our market leading execution in support of the 11 new products we've launched since 2009 has led our Pharmaceuticals business to a record 13 consecutive quarters of operational growth. That pace positions us as the fastest growing, top-10 global pharmaceutical company and U.S. leader in new product sales. Those new products, which includes ZYTIGA, STELARA and INVEGA SUSTENNA comprise 24% of our global pharmaceutical sales in the first half of 2013.","Now, we gave you a full review of our Pharmaceutical business in May, at which time we announced our intention to file more than 10 new molecular entities and 25 significant brand line extensions by 2017, so today I will just comment on two important developments we made in the quarter within our oncology division since the meeting which will really help to increase our leadership position in the category.","As we announced last week, ibrutinib became one of the first medicines to be filed with the FDA and the new breakthrough therapy designation. And if approved, it will be a first-in-class treatment option for patients who received prior therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma, and also for patients who received prior therapy for mantle cell lymphoma, population today have very limited options.","Now recognizing this need, we and our strategic partners at Pharmacyclics are pleased to have been able to open an expand access program for relapsed or refractory MCL patients in the U.S. The program began enrolling in May. It is allowed by the FDA as a means of making an investigational drug available to patients with a serious or immediately life-threatening disease without comparable or satisfactory alternatives.","We also announced a definitive agreement to acquire Aragon Pharmaceuticals, a move that will add their androgen receptor antagonist program to our R&D engine, including a lead development stage product ARN-509 for prostate cancer, which is attractive to us because the way it complements ZYTIGA were also increasing new options we can eventually offer patients in this important and growing segments of the oncology field.","So, now let's look at the market performance of some of our recent pharmaceutical launches. By combining superior science with best-in-class commercial capabilities, many of our newly launched products are delivering robust growth and outpacing our peers. As you can see, XARELTO, which is the broadest indication among novel oral anticoagulants is tracking well at of warfarin and the others in the category, in new to brand prescriptions among cardiologists and ZYTIGA is continuing on its strong growth trajectory gaining 22% in the U.S. chemo na\u00efve market since its approval in this indication in December.","INVOKANA, our new treatment for Type 2 diabetes was launched in the U.S. in April, was demonstrating very strong early results with the primary care and endocrinologists. Access INVOKANA is also building steadily and we are seeing strong interest from payers. Overall, 80% of patients with commercial plans now have access to INVOKANA in either Tier 2 or Tier 3. The success coupled with the supported joining the forces our pharmaceutical group with our Diabetes Care business has helped INVOKANA overtake Januvia, Onglyza and Trajenta in share of new to brand prescriptions in the important Endocrinologists segment.","This type of early progress demonstrates the power of leveraging our enterprise-wide capabilities to offer patients a full solutions based approach to diabetes management, and we are looking at leveraging our broad capabilities across the enterprise to support the growth of our products in other categories in similar ways.","As I referred to earlier, the pace of growth in the global MD&D markets has slowed and competition is intensifying. In spite of the economic compression however, the medical device industry remains attractive and we are transforming our go-to-market approach to drive our competitiveness in this dynamic environment and ensure we continue to lead the sector.","With market-leading platforms and products, we succeeded in sustaining or grown share in the majority of our key platforms, holding number one or number two positions in about 85% of them. We are continuing to bring innovations to patients and providers through meaningful product launches that will help sustain and drive growth and we are especially excited about the steady cadence of innovation emerging across the segment.","For example, Biosense Webster, a business unit that's on track to deliver another year of double-digit growth as it has for more than 10 years in a row. Their nMARQ, circular ablation catheter is designed to reduce cardiac ablation procedure time and complexity to key customer needs. It launched last year in Europe and we began enrolling patients in the clinical trial that will support our regulatory filing in the U.S. planned for next year.","Also, the ThermoCool SmartTouch Catheter is an important innovative product that measures the catheter tip contact force and direction inside the heart during ablation procedures in real time. We launched this product in the EU in 2012 and compelling new safety and efficacy data were presented recently at the Heart Rhythm Society meeting. These data will be included in our application for U.S. approval that we plan to submit later this year.","We are also bringing products to patients to meet specific market needs. The Bioseal fibrin sealant in China is just one of many. We are Also focusing our resources to advance more strategic options in our portfolio that start with taking a comprehensive view on the disease like we have done in large chronic disease states such as diabetes. Now to help dim the cost curve in healthcare we are focusing our broad and diverse R&D approach and portfolio to deliver total solutions of products that will increase the clinical value we offer patients and providers as well as the economic value we offer for healthcare systems and payers across the globe.","Consider the ATTUNE knee system which DePuy Synthes has just recently launched. The development team conducted extensive research in its design to help improve functional outcomes for patients, performance for surgeons and efficiency for providers. From the patient perspective, ATTUNE is designed to provide better range of motion and address the unstable feeling some knee replacement patients experienced and also provides an extensive range of sizes for better patient matching. From the provider perspective, simply reducing the number of instruments used with ATTUNE in addition to several innovative design features flattens the learning curve and delivers more efficiencies for the surgeon and operating room staff.","Now an update on DePuy Synthes. We are a year into the integration and as we envisioned, by broadening our base of offerings and expanding our reach in emerging markets, we have built a compelling growth combination that solidified our leadership in the $40 billion global orthopedics and neurologics marketplace. Our joint reconstruction business continues to do well especially with hips in the U.S. which have grown approximately 5% thus far in 2013. The ATTUNE knee that I just described has had a favorable initial response.","In trauma, we are encouraged by the second quarter results that generated mid single-digit operational growth in international markets, fueled by Europe as well as in emerging markets, notably China. In spine, disruption due to sales force attrition has improved and favorable increases in volume are being seen as the sales force continues to see momentum with cross-selling by the combined forces especially outside the U.S. with operational growth this past quarter in the mid-single digits.","While we still have work to do in certain areas of the integration, we are making good progress and we are seeing the benefits of bringing a broader portfolio of products to our customers to cross-selling including the collaboration between our cranio-maxillofacial and Codman businesses. We are also looking forward to similar results and to begin cross-selling products from our power tools and biomaterials platforms.","Now as we advance, we see additional growth in synergy opportunities within the organization and we are turning our attention to R&D and manufacturing and supply chain and to standardizing the IT infrastructure across the globe to improve our focus, speed and efficiency in order to realize them. You will hear more about the progress of our orthopedics business in the third quarter when Michel Orsinger, our worldwide chairman for DePuy Synthes will be on the call.","Our consumer segment is showing signs of its continued return to growth through its increasing momentum in returning a reliable supply of U.S. OTC products to the shelves, the continued expansion of iconic brands in the emerging markets and an overall focused portfolio and management approach. Sandy Peterson, who joined at the end of last year has already made an important impact on the organization. As group worldwide chairman, she holds a broad leadership role leading our supply chain, information technology and our consumer business sector. She is bringing a high level of broad and relative experience to our enterprise and I am pleased to be turning the call over to her in just a minute so that she can discuss her vision and plans for these vital areas of our business.","To recap, the year is off to a strong start. We have also made strong progress against our near-term priorities and long-term growth drivers to help sustain and drive growth in this dynamic global market. I will end by thanking our employees who work everyday on behalf of the patients, communities and shareholders that depend on us to deliver a high-quality and innovative products and solutions.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Sandy Peterson.","Sandra Peterson","Thanks, Alex. I have been with Johnson & Johnson now a little over seven months. It has been a great beginning and the longer I am here, the more excited I am about our ability to have a meaningful impact on people's lives around the globe. I have had the privilege to work at a number of well-respected companies, both inside and outside of healthcare and across geographies.","With that perspective, I am convinced that Johnson & Johnson is uniquely differentiated by its virtue of its broad portfolio, talented people and geographic reach to make a profound difference in health care. As you know, health care across the globe is changing as governments and consumers work to improve the quality of care and the rolls that providers, healthcare professionals and retailers also adapt and become more global.","I have spent much of my time so far meeting our customers and colleagues around the globe and learning our business. I have been to our major business and manufacturing campuses in the US, Brazil, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Belgium, China, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand. I have met with numerous retail and provider payer customers in the U.S. and in our key other regions, both, large global customers as well as small mom-and-pop operation. What is most striking to me is the talent and diversity of our colleagues around the globe. And equally impressive is experiencing our credo as the source of constancy and inspiration in a time of remarkable change inside our company and in health care across the globe.","Our consumer brands are strong and resilient. Our breadth is a source of strength and competitive advantage. Although we have been challenged in recent years, our reputation with consumers, retailers, healthcare professionals and providers remain strong. As you know, I have accountability for some of the company's key enterprise functions, supply chain, including quality and information technology, as well as our consumer business sector. This integrated portfolio affords us the capacity to leverage these important functions to help deliver innovation and value to our customers and company across sectors and across the globe. We have the opportunity to leverage our scale and breadth through world-class deployment of information technology services and supply chain to better serve the evolving needs of our customers and consumers.","Today, I will provide update related to our consumer businesses and the Johnson & Johnson supply chain. Let's start with what Alex had previously identified for you as one of our top enterprise-wide priorities, restoring a reliable supply of our U.S. OTC products. Our priorities in the U.S. OTC business are, first, to deliver on our consent decree milestones, second, to ensure reliable supply of OTC products to retailers and consumers. Third, to achieve both, brand leadership and sustained healthcare professional number one recommended status, fourth, to rebuild customer trust and become our customers' preferred partner and fifth to execute a return to market plan for core U.S. OTC brands and SKUs.","Our consent decree work plan was approved by the FDA without modification in the fourth quarter of 2012. We've achieved 100% on-time execution of the prescribed step through the second quarter. Additionally, all reports have been submitted to the FDA on time. We are making good progress on restoring our OTC brands to the shelf. We have achieve solid steady unit sale rates and consistent delivery commitments to customers and retailers.","By year end, our plan is to deliver reliable and consistent supply of three quarters of the product brands. In the first half of 2013, we achieved the U.S. OTC operational growth of 19.7%, which includes 26% growth in revenues in over-the-counter medicines, and we are winning the hearts of consumers as these products return to the shelves in all four segment cough, cold and flu, allergy, pain and digestive health. For instance, Extra Strength TYLENOL is the number one code in adult pain. Children's TYLENOL and MOTRIN are the top two SKUs in pediatric pain, and we are leading in other important categories such as allergy care with ZYRTEC and our digestive health brands IMODIUM and IMODIUM are returning the strength.","We are focusing on our top retail customers. We have achieved full distribution of key brands and point-of-sale has improved with all top retailers. We are partnering with them on strategic initiatives that are rebuilding our relationships and supporting their health and wellness strategies in order to educate consumers, simplify their purchasing experience and ultimately to help bring more consumers into their stores. Our strategic purpose for our consumer segment is caring for people around the world by anticipating their needs and creating solutions and experiences that help them and those they care for to live a healthy, vibrant lives and we are uniquely suited to do just that.","Our broad consumer portfolio, from well-being and beauty to health and (inaudible) is a competitive advantage as are our iconic brands. We have a legacy of innovation that leverages our scientific heritage and wins us unparalleled professional endorsements, trust-based relationships with healthcare professionals and deep consumer insights. We are applying the portfolio of discipline that calls on us to make choices that will drive global brand growth in key priority markets, including rationalizing SKUs and harmonizing formulations. With our long history in emerging markets, which represent a proportionately higher share of segment sales than elsewhere in Johnson & Johnson, we are globalizing existing brands such as Listerine, Motrin, Johnson's Baby and Carefree and complementing our portfolio with key local brands like Elsker in China and Rinzai and Dr. Mom brands in Russia.","Our consumer segment is not only a critical component of Johnson & Johnson's diverse portfolio and growth plan, our iconic brands are those that stakeholders most closely identify with Johnson & Johnson. We are pleased with the value creation opportunities ahead of us but we know, there is still work to be done to restore our OTC businesses to sustainable growth, while globalizing our remaining brand portfolio and investing in key market growth.","Let us now shift to how we are working to deliver a reliable and cost competitive supply of high quality products to our customers, consumers and patients across our businesses. Three years ago, we created a global enterprise supply chain. Our goal was to integrate into a network that would employ consistent quality standards and systems, leverage the scale and technological breadth of our portfolio and enable continuous production of cost-effective and high-quality products. This is a multiyear effort to integrate and leverage over 120 manufacturing sites, over 500 external manufacturers, 450 distribution centers and over 60 ERP systems that support about 275 operating companies. But the opportunity to leverage our scale and breadth to better meet our customers' evolving needs and maintain the highest quality and regulatory standards is significant.","We have implemented a new quality and compliance operating model to ensure consistent standards and capabilities across all products, businesses and geographies while strengthening independent oversight processes. For instance, we have adapted and are now deploying 34 common quality standards for all companies around the world. An independent internal audit program launched three years ago is ensuring that all Johnson & Johnson sites are in full compliance with health authority regulations and our own quality requirements.","Each of the three business segments has a chief quality officer responsible for developing the quality and compliance strategy and overseeing quality results for all companies in the segment globally. Each of the three business segments had the quality and compliance systems group to drive standardization and quality and compliance practices. We are evolving our supply chain model to enable leverage across our global network in sourcing, logistics, transportation and distribution management, and to strengthened business continuity plan.","Our improved product launch performance demonstrates tighter commercial integration. We have begun to consolidate and harmonize ours ERP landscape. This is a four-year program that will deliver efficiencies in terms of cost to offset pricing pressures and working capital improvements, supply reliability and flexibility for years to come.","We are integrating Synthes, into our global supply chain network and quality systems, and we are optimizing our products supply network both, internally and externally to meet our growth objectives for new product launches and emerging market growth.","Health care is a challenging, but intensely rewarding space. In a few months that I have been part of the Johnson & Johnson leadership team, I have gained even more conviction and we are making a real difference for consumers, for patients, for customers, providers and health care system. I see the enormous opportunity we have to do more and I am looking forward to growing our businesses and creating meaningful innovation for our customers and value for shareholders.","Thank you for the opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you today.","And now, I'll turn it over to Dominic.","Dominic Caruso","Thank you, Sandy, and good morning, everyone. It is really great to have Sandy join us today on the call and it's a real pleasure working with her as a new member of our executive committee,","I would like to now provide some brief comments about our results and also provide our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of 2013. I am pleased to say, we've had a strong first half of 2013. The breadth of our business, which provides balance and consistency to our overall performance, as well as the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our people in all of our locations around the world positions us well to sustain growth in this increasingly dynamic global health care market.","While there are some indicators of general economic improvement, the healthcare market data we see in terms of utilization is still relatively flat over the prior year, with just a modest sequential improvement over the first quarter utilization data. Overall, however, we continue to drive growth in many areas of our business, especially in the pharmaceutical segment with the launch of new products addressing unmet needs.","Alex and Louise already commented on our results for the quarter, so let me just mention the impact of special items this quarter. There were special items recorded in the other income and expense line during the second quarter of approximately $560 million on a pretax basis. That consisted of charges for litigation expense accruals related to various legal matters DePuy ASR hip program cost. And, as expected, continued costs associated with the global integration of Synthes. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.48 exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by first call. Now, let me provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2013.","Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $10 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and $15 billion of debt. We continue to generate very strong cash flows. For purposes of your models assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million, a slight improvement from our previous guidance.","Turning now to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation. and other divestitures, asset sales or write-offs. As previously disclosed, during the second quarter, we sold our equity interest in ECHELON and that gain is reflected in this line. This account is difficult to forecast, but we would be comfortable with your models for 2013, reflecting other income and expense as a net gain, excluding special items ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance and includes the gain from the sale of our equity interest in ECHELON.","Now, a word on taxes. Through the second quarter of 2013, the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was approximately 19.5%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 at approximately between 19% and 20%, or slightly lower rate than our previous guidance. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate during the remainder of the year.","Now, turning to sales and earnings. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth on a constant currency basis of between approximately 6% and 7% for the year, which is higher than our previous guidance. This would result in estimated sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.3 billion to $71.9 billion.","While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2013 were to stay where they were as of last week, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 2% for the year. Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 4% and 5% for the year for an expected level of reported sales of approximately between $70 billion and $70.6 billion which is lower than our prior guidance simply due to the overall weakening of foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the Japanese Yen, Brazilian Real and the British Pound.","Now, turning to earnings. Considering the strength we saw in our operating results for the first half, we suggest that you consider full year 2013 earnings per share estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.42 and $5.49 per share on an operational basis at constant currency rates or an operational growth rate of between 6.5% and 7.5%, which is higher than our previous guidance. As a reminder, the benefit from the Elan gain, as we noted, would largely be reinvested in the business and our other income guidance is unchanged. So this increase is related to the operational performance of the business which we see improving.","We are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share if currency rates for the balance of 2013 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share or $0.04 lower than the impact we had previously estimated in our guidance solely due to exchange rate fluctuations. We therefore suggest that you model our reported earnings per share excluding special items in the range between $5.40 and $5.47 per share or a growth rate of between 6% and 7%, resulting in a reported EPS guidance being higher than our previous reported EPS guidance, reflecting our strong operational performance somewhat offset by the movement in currency rates.","Overall, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you should see pretax operating margins will continue to show improvement over the prior year as we indicated at the beginning of this year and which we feel confident we can achieve, given the strength our operating performance while we continue to invest for future growth.","Now, Louise, back to you for the Q&A session.","Louise Mehrotra","Thank you, Dominic. Stephanie, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","I wanted to ask that, at a recent event which was the allowance of the patent application on ZYTIGA in combination with prednisone and could you give us your updated view on the life of that ZYTRIGA in the U.S. and how ZYTIGA is going to fit with ARN-509 and the Aragon acquisition and where do you see the position in the two products? Thanks","Alex Gorsky","Hi, Mike, this is Alex. Thanks a lot for the questions. As you know, Janssen has got five years of data exclusivity in the U.S. from the date of approval which was April 2011 or until April 2016. We are also watching the Hatch-Waxman extension to December 2016. At this point in time, we believe that those are the correct dates of using. Obviously we are going to be looking at some of these other recent events closer to see what impact it may have. But at this time, we are sticking with December 2016.","Regarding the Aragon, look we think it\u2019s a great complement to our portfolio. If you look at the great job, frankly, that our team has been able to do with Zetia in the launch regarding the clinical backup, actually the actual approval of the compound, the ongoing clinical development, very impressive, the commercial penetration that we have seen, as well as the care programs for the patients, we think it represents a significant capability. Now when you complement that with the Aragon compound, it will certainly enable us to leverage all of those skills on to a next phase. We think that there could be potentially complementary utilization of those compounds together and again as one another example of us continuing to really make a difference for patients and for our business and is very exciting oncology area.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Two quick follow ups if I can. One, is there an update on the plans for the Clinical Diagnostics. And, two, Dominic, where are you with the completion of last year's ASR and could you just talk about thoughts on additional share repurchase following that? Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Mike. I'll take the first half of that question and then I'll ask Dominic to follow up on the second part. As you remember, earlier this year we announced that we were going to be exploring the future. The Diagnostics group at an enterprise level. And the initiation of this process was really part of a broader strategic planning process across Johnson & Johnson. Recognizing that we wanted to be very disciplined and decisive about what we are going to do with our businesses and our capabilities going forward.","Now, as we stated back in January, we expect that this process could take anywhere from about 12 months to 24 months. We're on track for that. We're still in the early-stages and we think it's premature at this time to speculate about specific impact, but we are continuing to look at our options. Dominic?","Dominic Caruso","Yes. Hi, Michael. On the ASR program, we expect it will be completed in early August, and we are near of the completion of it. As soon as we complete that programs then we will be permitted to recommence the share purchases that we normally do in a normal course of business, which as I think you all know, we repurchase all the shares that are issued in connection with any employee compensation programs, so we'll obviously commence that right after the ASR program is completed in early August.","As far as any larger, more significant share buyback program, as we said before, we always evaluate that in the spirit of utilizing our strong cash flows, but quite frankly in the priority, we've always said, first our dividend, second to use in building our businesses to generate even more sustainable cash flows for the future, and then finally, considering an additional return to shareholders as appropriate given the first two.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Jashnani, UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","My first question was on consumer business, Sandy. And, I was hoping you would talk a little bit about the margins in that business and clearly there is some cost associated with compliance that are ongoing now. But, maybe if you talk about how you see that playing out over the next few years and some of the investments you had to make on the brand. Thanks.","Sandra Peterson","Thanks for the question. As you know, we are still in the process of remediating the OTC business, which is an ongoing effort. And, clearly, we will spend what it takes to ensure that we are completely compliant with the CD, and we are bringing all of the products back.","Our expectation is that that will continue for the near-term. But, in addition to all of the remediation efforts, we also are going to ensure that we are investing sufficiently to bring these brands back and bring them back fully to consumers and retailers and that our current estimation is that we will probably be spending at a higher rate than our historical averages as we are bringing all of these brands back. So, that clearly in the near-term, will have some impact on our margins. But at the same time, we are also working very hard to you globalize our core brand portfolio, and by doing that that will improve our margins over time across the total consumer portfolio. And, we have also, the team has put a lot of effort in the last couple of years in reducing overheads and driving efficiencies throughout the business.","So, I think what you will see that over time, we will start seeing improvements in our margins as we bring the OTC portfolio back and as we globalize the rest of our core portfolio. And our expectation is that, our business will have similar margin in the consumer sectors as you see in the other parts of the JNJ portfolio, as we bring all of these businesses back and we will continue to improve the margins over time.","Louise Mehrotra","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Good morning, one for Alex and one for Sandy. Alex, if you look at the Pharma results, ZYTIGA, XARELTO and INCIVO were big drivers globally, but it looks like Europe accelerated again this quarter even if you back out adjustments one timers ZYTIGA, INCIVO. So, my question is whether one or two things that's changed in Europe is maybe going to gain all the share.","Alex Gorsky","I am sorry, Matt. Would you repeat the last part of that question?","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Yes. What's driving the share gains in Europe for kind of the base business not the new products, but the base? It seems like you continue to do better and better in Europe, in pharma.","Alex Gorsky","Yes. Well, Matt, really its strong performance across both base and launch brands. So if you take a look, for example, of how we are doing in the CNS area, continued growth with those products. We have had, of course, a number of new launches on top of that. I think, overall, our team is just executing extremely well. So I really think it\u2019s a mix, both of some of the core brands combined with the new product launches that\u2019s driving that kind of performance.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Okay, then. Just to hear from Sandi. Sandi, one area you didn\u2019t hit on was skincare, which is almost as big as OTC nutritionals and the last, I would say, three quarters even again, ex-divestitures, it looks like it slowed a little bit. Is that market share or market growth and is there anything coming there, innovation wise that could accelerate the growth?","Sandra Peterson","Matt, thanks for the question. Actually, the overall skin care market, as a category is improving, but it is still not what it used to be at our historical level. However, our own business is doing relatively well. So our Neutrogena portfolio, in the U.S., we have gained 0.5 share point in the first half of this year. Our Aveeno business is up almost 8%. Our LPN business in Europe is growing close to 10%. Our Johnson's adult business is growing in the mid-single digit level. So those are all very positive things and we are feeling good about our businesses in Asia as well.","The one thing that is impacting those that are in this category is the sun care business. The market category is down 11% in the first half of this year. We have actually been gaining share in the U.S. over 2% and we are now the number two global sun care provider in the world. So the impact of the sun care market clearly is having an impact on the overall business and while we are doing very well in it, a little over 2% is less than the historical rates that you would see normally in that business. So that\u2019s a general sense of how we are doing in the skincare portfolio and that\u2019s why you see a relatively low overall growth rate because of market growth. But our shares are actually growing in our core brands.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","I just want to take a step back, I guess, and just discuss what gives you, I guess, the confidence to raise the overall operational outlook for the rest of the year? Is it coming more, and obviously you had a good first half, but is there anything kind of in the end markets either within medical devices that gives you some increased confidence or are you just having a higher level of mix on more of the pharma side with some the performance there?","Alex Gorsky","Hi, Kristen, this is Alex. Thanks for the question. I will start off and then I will ask Dominic to finish. But I think overall as we characterize our business, we are really pleased with what we have seen during the first six months. We have made a lot of progress around our top objectives that we have been very clear about from the very beginning delivering on our financial performance. Obviously accelerating the launch of our pharmaceutical products. As we look at that portfolio and particularly there is a couple of things, one is in spite of new competition, really all of our newly launched categories, we continue to see very good uptake.","We think that\u2019s driven, first of all, product profiles that really important for patients but they also have been very well-developed by our clinical development team. Two, by great commercial excellence. I think that\u2019s demonstrated in our ability to differentiate but also in our ability to ensure access for these products through managed care Medicaid in the United States but also through tendering processes outside the United States. We have also seen good performance in our pipeline and development by bringing in through licensing and acquisitions but also continued progress in our own. So, all around, our pharma business, we believe, is in a good place and certainly positioned well for future growth.","If we look at the MD&D, clearly we have been challenged by the macroeconomic situation that\u2019s having an impact on demand around the world. If I start in the United States, what we have seen is fairly flat performance overall. By the way, if we look at some of the leading indicators, for example, if we look at hospital admissions, if we look at inpatient procedures, we see relatively flat to even slightly negative statistics. The primary care physician visits are in the low single-digits. We have got you multiple quarters, consecutive quarters now, with those types of trends. We don\u2019t expect that to turn in the near-term. Longer-term, we will have to see the impact of the Affordable Care Act on that. That being said, we remain very committed to our MD&D business. In areas such as Biosense Webster, ENT, Vision Care, we have seen very positive performance this quarter. However, if you look at some of our other core businesses, surgical care for example, sutures and surgical instruments, we see the challenges associated with the macroeconomic environment.","We're also somewhat, I would say, I encouraged as well by what we are seeing in orthopedics, particularly in hips and knees and trauma over the past quarter. And, clearly, if we look at our consumer group, we see a very strong performance from our U.S. OTC business. Sandy took you through some of that earlier. I think around the rest of the world, we tend to follow more what we are seeing with GDP, but if we total all of that, we think that we are continuing to make good progress. We still see challenges ahead. At the same time, our teams and our employees, I think, continue to demonstrate that we are delivering on our commitments and that's the way we intend to finish out the rest of the year.","Dominic Caruso","So, I wouldn't add anything else except that we are not reading into our performance any uptick in utilization trends generally speaking, so I think that that still remains to be challenging for the balance of the year. But as Alex said, individual product performance is really pretty exceptional especially in the Pharma business.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","And then just really quickly just the breaking out of the Nutritionals from the OTC business, what was the rationale for that as Nutritionals is an area where you might look to divest or how should we just think about that separation?","Alex Gorsky","Yes. We wanted to break it out, so actually for your benefit, so you can track the progress in our return of the OTC business. You know it's pretty significant in terms of our progress there. I think it sometimes gets buried by the groupies of different things in the same line, so really for your benefit in your modeling purposes we want to show you singularly what the U.S. an overall OTC business was doing. No other reason than that.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Alex and one for Dominic. Alex, could you share with us your first and second quarter growth rates in emerging markets? Given the macroeconomic and political dynamics, could you give us your latest thoughts on the outlook in those markets for health care in general and your business? And, for Dominic, then after that I'll ask my question for Dominic.","Alex Gorsky","Larry, this Alex. Larry, we are not splitting it out specifically for all emerging markets, but if we take a look at our BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India, China, what are saying is about 19% growth. You can see obviously that that's a significant multiple of what we are seeing in developed markets. Again, I think it's built on the fact that we've been in these markets for a substantial period of time, particularly if you take a look at our consumer and our MD&D business in places like China, but even our pharmaceutical business as well as the other businesses in places like Brazil, we made investments over the last several years in our consumer and our MD&D business for example with (Inaudible) [Elsker], Bioseal in China, and so we see these markets as very important for our growth. We continue to see good uptake in health care. It's something that we are watching very closely in light of the larger macroeconomic environment.","But, overall, we believe that these markets represent a significant growth opportunity simply because more patients are receiving access to treatment. And, secondly, because we have solid positions in many of these areas.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","That's helpful. Just to clarify the 19%, Alex, in the BRIC markets. Was that for Q2 or the first half of the year?","Alex Gorsky","That was Q2.","Sandra Peterson","And, it excludes Synthes.","Alex Gorsky","Larry, and it excludes Synthes.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Okay. And, Dominic, you grew, I think, 4.8% year-to-date ex-Synthes. I think, Alex talked about earlier in the presentation. Correct me if I am wrong, but the updated guidance implies about 2% to 4% in the second half of the year. Is my math correct and is this just conservatism or is there any reason why you would expect the second half to be slower than the first half. Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","Yes. So, we were looking at operational growth. Let's focus on that, because obviously currencies that have a negative impact on our sales growth. Operationally, for the first half, we had pretty strong growth, all related to the pharmaceutical business primarily and obviously the inclusion of Synthes. In the back half of the year, to get to about between 6% and 7% operational growth that I was referring to, we would expect about 4% overall growth for the back half of the year because the first half obviously was impacted by Synthes. So that\u2019s that math I have, Larry, about 10% this quarter, roughly 10% for the first half of the year, between 6% and 7% for the full year, which implies about 4% in the back half of the year on an operational basis, excluding any currency impacts.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","My question, to start off with just a couple of housekeeping items. Was there any impact to sales this quarter from either in the pharma, the Medicaid rebate adjustment or in medical devices, any extra selling days that might have inflated sales growth rates?","Alex Gorsky","So, Derrick, no Medicaid rebate adjustments in this particular quarter. We had a significant adjustment last quarter that we talked extensively about but nothing of that nature in this quarter. With selling days, we don\u2019t know if there is any real significant impact for selling days this quarter.","Louise Mehrotra","Really no significant impact. It's about 0.2 days. That\u2019s all OUS. It only really impacts our orthopedics business. Okay?","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Great, and Louise, could you give us a sense for the breakout of pricing and mix, again for the orthopedic divisions?","Louise Mehrotra","Sure. So price worldwide, just price is about 1% decline and that\u2019s consistent U.S., OUS and total and that\u2019s as the same as the first quarter. Now if we get into the U.S. only, where I have a price and mix number. For hips, the price was down about 3.5% very consistent with the prior periods. Mix, however was up about 1.5%. So it netted to about a 2% decline. So that\u2019s a little bit more favorable than the first quarter. When you go into knees, the price number was down about 1%. We did have favorable mix again. For now we are about 0.5% favorable and that is very consistent with what we had in the first quarter.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","How about spine?","Louise Mehrotra","Okay, so in terms of spine, price was about 3% negative for the second quarter and mix was about to 2.5% positive, netting to about 0.5% negative, very similar trend on the total between the first and the second quarter. However, just a little bit of changes between price and mix.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Great, thank you. Just one more for Sandi, if I could. Sandi, what are your expectations for how much share you will gain, once you get your products back into the market, now that you have seen how the initial relaunch of your OTC products is going. I understand that\u2019s 75% expectation for brands to market. But how much of that lost share do you recapture when you hit the market? Thank you.","Sandra Peterson","Thanks for the question. Quite honestly, we were still in early days. Our intent and we are on track to bring 75% of those brands back this year. We have others that we will be bringing back next year. But as we begin to get into the stores and interact with consumers again, we have had very positive responses from not only retailers but that consumers and healthcare professionals. It is a little early to be able to answer that question, but what I can tell you is that in the first half of the year, we have seen with the limited on distribution, now we have full distribution, but in the first half we only had limited distribution, we have seen things like our Extra Strength TYLENOL share double in the first half of the year. We have seen significant growth with most of our other products that we have brought back to the market. But it\u2019s a little early for us to actually give you a clear sense of what that number will be. Clearly, our intent and our desire is to get back to the share numbers that we had before we went in to the CD process and that\u2019s what we are really focused on doing.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Just two questions to Dominic. I just want to follow up on an earlier question. That is the implied guidance for the second half of the year. Even if I assume the top end of the guidance, that still assumes a second half earnings growth of 4.5% versus 9% during the first half. So I can't imagine that having Synthes now fully annualized would affect the operational growth rate that much. May be it does, but if you just talk about what specific headwinds you expect in the second half that we did not see in the first half.","Then, Alex, a question for you, as long as we have the opportunity to have you on the call, if you could talk sort of bigger picture about business development, Dominic said that your priority is, number one, the dividend. Number two, business development or maybe you have that mixed up. And then number three share buybacks. But now with Synthes having fully annualized, just wondering if you could talk to what your business priorities are in terms of specific businesses, what sort of size we should anticipate. How are you thinking about business development? Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","So, Jamie, on the earnings part of the back half versus first half comparison, remember we did indicate that we expected this other income and expense line to be about $800 million for the year that's consistent with our guidance now, so no change there. But, of course, you with the \u00c9lan gain coming, all in one quarter, the vast majority of that has already happened in the first half of the year. So.","Sandra Peterson","That contributes this quarter?","Alex Gorsky","Yes. As you look at that, we released in April, we talked about the fact that we sold our Elan shares and we filed a registration statement concerning that and we indicated the estimated gain was going to be about $200 million from that sale we then sold some additional shares later in the year. So, think about it as a better $0.07 kind of number that we disclosed earlier, but to put one thing in perspective with this other income and expense line, your models, of course, have modeled one quarter of the $800 million, which is about what I had expected a model and this quarter we had within that line $400 million of other income and expense, right, because as the \u00c9lan gain in there. So, if you look at the impact just this quarter of the \u00c9lan gain versus the overall analyst models, I would say that that $200 million excess or roughly $150 million after-tax is worth about $0.05 compared to what the Street has been modeling.","Dominic Caruso","Okay. And, Jamie, for your first question, I think the way that I would frame our overall position is look, we are going to continue to look for internal and external opportunities that we feel is going to drive our growth going forward. We've been very consistent in saying that when there are new technologies, new innovations that give us a platform to build, and I think a great example of that is what we have done in oncology over the past few years and our pharmaceutical business. There is a lot of unmet medical need and we've been able to do some great partnering to rapidly build what we feel is now a world-class platform in oncology both, from a pharmaceutical development but also from a commercial and access point of view.","The next area that we look at of course is, what businesses could be complementary to our existing businesses. What may round out some of our current portfolios or allow, build on capabilities that we currently have and there are other opportunities perhaps, where we look at vertical integration. What we've done for example in our biosurgicals business is a great example of that with OMRIX, and we are excited about the potential that has is we are in the process of launching that on a global level, but that's the way we look at it. But, regarding our pharmaceutical business, look, I am really proud of the work the team has done there in taking agreement such as what we've done with Pharmacyclics, what we've done with (Inaudible), what we have done with other organizations in partnering and adding on to our portfolio to bring forward great opportunities for patients, but also for our business.","In MD&D, obviously, the Synthes transaction was very large transaction. Michel and his team are doing a very nice job through the integration process, but we realize that that does take some time. We remain committed to having the broadest and most comprehensive orthopedics platform. We are seeing that happening right now as those businesses come together.","In consumer, we think the consumer area [level]-one consumerism will also be very important as we go forward in healthcare. And, we have made some select acquisition they are particular in China over the past couple of years. We have also done some other divestments in our business as we really focus more in certain areas of our portfolio and as we have also done in MD&D, so I think that's overall our approach. We want to continue to look for technologies and innovations that really make a difference for patients, we want to continue to look for opportunities to that can be complementary add-on, give us additional customer offerings or if we see other brand-new areas that we think can really be transformational, obviously we would be interested in that as well.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on the diabetes business a little bit. You mentioned some of the impacts on competitive bidding. Can you talk a little bit, Alex, about your commitment to that business going forward and how we think about the business now in the context of competitive bidding? Louise, if you could remind us the impact of competitive bidding to the business? How much of the business is as opposed to Medicare?","Alex Gorsky","Hi, Danielle, thank you vey much for the question. Look, overall, what I would say is that J&J and our diabetes companies, we still feel we are very uniquely positioned for strong leadership and success in the category based on a great track record that we have had in technology innovation scale and brand equity. If you just look at diabetes, of course, its one of the largest and most significant issues in healthcare today. I think there is somewhat around 370 million people with diabetes today, projected to go to almost 500 million by 2020. So the need is great. It is a very difficult area to control.","Now what I would say is that with the recent launch of Invokana, our sales and marketing efforts are broadly targeting both endocrinologists and primary care physician to treat a vast majority of these Type 2 patients. Both Janssen and LifeScan Animas are partnering to accomplish this objective. It is the first time where LifeScan Animas have been involved in promoting an oral therapeutic agent of any kind. That really helps to expand their reach and it strengthens basically their commercial and clinical relevance beyond just glucose monitoring and insulin delivery among those healthcare professionals.","Then when you compound that with the Calibra acquisition that we recently did, it\u2019s the Wearable Insulin Patch technology, we feel that that\u2019s going to be a very good opportunity for patients making it easier for them. If they are currently on basal only insulin therapy and they need an easy to administer mealtime dosing option, that certainly provides that. But while we look at all that, we also acknowledge the realities of the market and now with a competitive bidding process, the 72% reduction in pricing that we are experiencing in the United States, we are having to adapt our business model to meet that challenge.","But again it\u2019s a diabetes, we think, is a very important space of a lot of unmet medical need. We think we have a number of offerings across our MD&D, pharmaceutical and consumer segment that can address them. But clearly we will adapt to those changing dynamics as events unfold and as we predict they will unfold in the coming years.","Louise Mehrotra","And Medicare sales are just over 20% of the U.S. business.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann","Okay, great. Thanks so much. Then on Synthes, if I could dig a little bit deeper on that. You mentioned a stable or some positive momentum and fine procedures. I am wondering how much of that is underlying market growth versus specific to Synthes and how is Synthes doing relative to your internal expectations as far as sales force attrition goes and how are you managing that going forward? Thanks so much, guys.","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Let me start with Synthes. Overall, look, we are really pleased with the way the integration is going. Taking on a company the size of Synthes with a reputation that scale its capabilities is no small undertaking. Bringing those together the way that our teams have, I think, they are really to be commended for it. We have got a multi-phased program in place to bring it together commercially, the entire research and development organization as well as all the supporting functional areas. When you look at, for example, our hip and knee performance in the United States, we saw growth in our hip area up 5%, again based on new products being introduced, things like (inaudible), CORAIL, other things, our knee business being helped by the introduction of the ATTUNE new knee system.","If we compare those to the U.S. growth rates, we are estimating and this is first quarter data because we don\u2019t have all second quarter data yet, of 1% in hips and slightly down in knees. We think that\u2019s very favorable performance and again keeping those segments focused, keeping them delivering while going through the integration is no small feat. If we look at trauma, we are up 2% in the U.S. versus the market that we think is probably going around 6%. We have seen some loss of share due to the nail recall that we experienced early in the earlier. We think it's being managed well, we think we will see our way through that on a worldwide basis, so we think we are you growing commensurate with what we are seeing with the market, so continued strong emerging market growth, the globalization that we offer to some of those businesses we think is real opportunity.","Now last, but not least in spine, on a worldwide basis what we see the market is down about 2%. We think we are down about 1%, so we think we are commensurate. In the U.S., we have seen the performance when we were down about 7% versus the market that was down about three. We were clearly impacted by some transitional issues with our sales force during that period. They put a comprehensive plan in place, where we think that we project that will do much better going forward.","And more importantly, when you look at the offerings that our representatives have across the minimally invasive segment, degenerative, spine, a number of other areas combined with the rest of our portfolio is going to put us in a very good position in that marketplace. So, we remain very optimistic, pleased with the performance around the integration and feel that DePuy Synthes again is going to be good for patients and also be good for our business.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question please?","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Good morning and thank you very much for the time. Really two questions and one is two parts. Alex, a question for you first, clearly some discussion not only in the press today, which has been in the press for some time about the ministry of public security looking into business practices principally in China. And, I am concerned that that you'd spread not only to Glaxo, but to other companies, including JNJ. Just simply looking business practices, can you comment on what you know today maybe going on what sort of investigations and whether or not your practices are being discussed.","Then two product questions. One, clearly around the very strong growth of PREZISTA, up 80%, sequentially, Louise or Dominic, any commentary that you can make regarding that very strong growth, sequentially. Then second on XARELTO, if I understand 20% sequential growth, but you believe that's solely driven by DTC. Thanks very much.","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Tony. Let me start up. Look, on the first question what I would is that, we are absolutely committed to ensuring that our businesses are run in a highly compliant manner around the world. And, we have a very active compliance program in place in the country such as China little on all the BRIC countries. We continue to update our policies and procedures as we get more information. At the same time, we recognize that these countries are very important markets going forward.","By that there is still a lot of unmet medical need with patients. And, clearly, we know that these governments are also very committed to ensuring that they have a compliant environment at the same time they are getting access for their citizens to important health care options. So, we remain very diligent on it. We've made significant investments in these areas in compliance and we want to work closely with these countries and governments to ensure that we are working together in a collaborative way to ensure we have a very compliant environment going forward. Louise?","Louise Mehrotra","Charlie, more in PREZISTA, we have seen just the basic market share improvement over the quarter. I mean, PREZISTA is doing very well. Our sales team is doing an excellent job and the product has become quite frankly a mainstay in HIV therapy, so it's really just we saw pretty strong market share growth, sequentially.","Then on XARELTO, we did do some DTC there, but I think that product as we've talked about before with the breadth of its indications is becoming much more recognized as a standard of care in that marketplace. And as Alex pointed out earlier, you know, we've now surpassed warfarin in the new to brand share. So, I think the breadth and our strategy around the breadth of that compound in the market that needs that kind of therapy that has both, exceptional efficacy and obviously safety is what's driving that growth. I wouldn't just pin it on overall DTC advertising. I would say just a breadth of the overall indications for the product as we expected. That's what our strategy was and looks like to playing out.","Alex Gorsky","Yes, Tony, I would just add one other thing on to that because I think Dominic gave a really comprehensive answer. That is in addition to the clinical development program which resulted in numerous indications, it's really gives physicians a very broad application of the product. They have also done a great job done by our access team in ensuring broad formulary access in our managed care in places here in the United States. So I think now we have got more than 85% access of Tier 2 in both private as well as Medicare customers. That\u2019s very important for them. It relates to an issue of affordability, of convenience and of course the reason that we are able to get that kind of access is because our team has done a great job of demonstrating the clinical and overall economic value of XARELTO to those patients and in those settings.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Navarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Navarro - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. A question for Alex. Alex, I would like your view on the CapEx environment in the United States. It appears the environment remains challenging. I know you spend a lot of time visiting hospitals and hospital executives. Is the CapEx challenged environment a function of utilization? Is it a function of healthy health care reform? So just curious of your views.","Then, as a follow-up, what do you think turns the CapEx environment to the positive in the U.S.? Thanks.","Alex Gorsky","Hi, thank you very much, Glenn. Look, I would say, in discussions that I have had with hospital CEOs and with other people in the marketplace, I have seen a couple of things. One is, clearly there has been a recession now for, I believe, almost 10 to 12 consecutive quarters, where we see that admissions in the hospitals as well as numbers of procedures being flat to negative. Now clearly we are seeing some shift to the outpatient setting but when it comes to inpatient procedures and additions, that market is obviously being impacted by the macroeconomic conditions.","I think secondly, people are waiting to see the full impact of the Affordable Care Act. They are still working their way through the details and how that might affect. There is certainly changes regarding risk bearing areas such as hospital acquired infections and other procedures. So I think that\u2019s also having an impact.","Third, we are seeing is that patients, frankly, and customers as being more demanding about the data that is supporting justification for new approaches, new procedures and innovation.","So that\u2019s the way I would describe the overall CapEx environment as it related to hospitals.","Glenn Navarro - RBC Capital Markets","And just as one quick follow-up. Do you have a view on Europe? Europe has remained very challenging from a utilization and a capital point of view? That appears to be stable. Is that correct?","Alex Gorsky","What I would say, Glenn, is it\u2019s a bit of a tale of two cities. I think on one hand what we see in CapEx, particularly if you go to Southern Europe, it\u2019s a very challenging environment and it's because of, again, the macro economic situation they are facing. I don\u2019t think we have seen a pronounced decrease or improvement. We have seen it fairly steady quarter-to-quarter but we expect that to remain a very challenging environment going forward. On the other hand, what we have seen, is that when you introduce new innovations such as our pharmaceutical group has done, over the past 12 months they can really make a difference for patients that you can get reimbursement and get access for patients.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Thanks, good morning. So, Alex, I very much appreciate the update in perspective. There is a lot to talk about here. But I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on your thoughts on innovation as you had just mentioned and earlier in the call, particularly as it pertains to MD&D and a few different factors, just the first, to a degree towards new technologies, smart instruments and your competitors in different areas of putting that out. You have put that out obviously effectively with Biosense Webster over time. Number two, whether these opportunities are greater in areas where you have an established business like orthopedics, like cardio or whether new platforms and opportunities are as attractive.","Then finally, I you think you just mentioned again presenting innovations in a way that hospital and caregivers can recognize the value and are willing to pay for them. So, maybe just your broad thoughts as to factors pertaining to MD&D, and I have one follow-up for Sandy.","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Matt, thanks a lot for the question. If I reflect on it at a very broad level, what I would say around MD&D is that, look innovation is going to continue to be important. However, I think that the bar will be raised on the data will be required to describe and represent that innovation, so let me give you a few examples.","I think, overall what we are saying is incremental innovation while still clearly an important part of the overall portfolio and ultimately that can help you lead a path a significant breakthrough innovation is not being rewarded with, for example increased pricing or improved pricing in the marketplace and we would expect over time that we will need to have more transformational innovation or more significant innovation. We recognize that that's going to require additional clinical development and investments. At the same time, we think at Johnson & Johnson, we are uniquely positioned in that category. Given the broad breadth and scale capabilities that we have at our pharmaceutical group and in our medical device group.","So, for example, what we've done in our biosurgicals area, as we are getting ready to launch Fibrin Pad, the way that we are having our cardiovascular team, even the for example, work with XARELTO, and some of the things that we are doing Biosense Webster, it gives us a unique opportunity for convergence. And, in fact, we see opportunities in some of these segments to look innovation differently and frankly raise the bar with innovation from a clinical point of view, but also from a regulatory point of view that's in the best interest of patients as well as for our business.","We look at areas going forward. I think it's going to be a combination. We still think that in areas such as general surgery, when we look at biosurgicals, when we look at your areas such as energy, there's a lot of opportunity to make procedures less invasive, to simplify the procedures, particularly in emerging markets that will ultimately lead to better overall outcomes and reducing morbidity.","We think in other areas, there is great technology opportunity. Such in Biosense Webster, so in the in the general surgery category, I think there is a lot of opportunity for growth in orthopedics. We are working on innovation with products like the ATTUNE Knee, like a number of things that we are doing in spine and hip as of late. We're also looking at innovation from a commercial model standpoint.","What can we do around having a broader offering, a different kind of relationship and partnership with hospitals and other large payers, again in a way that's good for patients that helps to improve outcomes, but also is better for the institution and we think again there too we are uniquely position given the breadth, the depth, the scale and size of our business.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","That's great. Thank you for that. And then for Sandy, and maybe Alex you may want to chime in on this as well, but around the quality and regulatory and we tend to have focused over the past couple of years on the pathway and the process for OTC in sort of managing through the OTC-specific challenges that have come up, but it would be very helpful if you touch a little bit on this with respect to the supply chain but it would be great to hear and maybe some of the changes you made proactive in ongoing at your other major businesses and facilities, and maybe if you could provide some examples or anecdotes, it would help illustrate the progress that you are making across the organization in terms of quality.","Sandra Peterson","So, Matt, thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, our quality effort is across the enterprise, across all of our businesses, our manufacturing sites as well as all of our R&D sites, because they are under the scope of trying to ensure that we have the highest standard of quality for the safety and care of our patients and consumers. So, when we launched the quality initiative a number of years ago, the focus really was ensuring that we have got consistent quality standards.","We went through a three-year cycle that were just ending the first of the cycle over a three year period, where we have gone through all of our manufacturing facilities, all of our core strategic suppliers as well as all of our R&D site to ensure that all of them are living up to the appropriate regulatory standards in those countries that also are standard that at J&J, we believe is one of the highest in the industry and its across all of our sectors.","So there has been an immense amount of work and focus in ensuring that we have consistency across our operations, across our product lines and across all of the countries in which we operate. We have, obviously, as we gone through all of this work, we have identified corrective actions and we have immediately taken those corrective actions. We are harmonizing systems. We are putting in place processes and systems so that we have early warning. Systems in place to understand if there is, we think, may be something going on with a product, so we identify it early and we go out and correct it.","In addition to that, an important component of all of this is how we are managing our global supply chain. So one of the very important changes that we have been making with our global supply chain is ensuring that all of our external suppliers, so our material suppliers are thoroughly reviewed, are thoroughly managed and that they are living up to our quality standards. In that process in the last three years, we have actually consolidated our external manufacturing, our external material suppliers by about a third. So we have a third less than we had three years ago. That means that we an ability to manage them much more effectively and ensure that we are reviewing their quality of their products coming into our facilities.","We have also looked at our external manufacturers, those that provide finished products to us and we manage those across the enterprise now in a very rigorously manner with thorough and thorough audits and we are learning across the enterprise how to share best practice from business to business and technology to technology. So this effort is not just focus on the OTC business, it is really across all of our businesses in all of our countries globally. We are ensuring that we independent audits and independent approach to managing this but we are ensuring that we also are putting the right systems, processes and capital and automation in place in all of our facilities around the globe.","So we have made significant progress. I think one other indication of that progress is that over the last couple of years, we recently closed out a number of warning letters and we are making very good progress on the ones that are remaining but we are feeling good about where we are. Always things can happen. We have 300,000 SKUs around the globe. So that\u2019s where our vigilance has to be, as ensuring every single one of those SKUs are meeting our high standards.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Just wanted to get a little bit more of an update on the diabetes care businesses where you have been progressing to in terms of market share versus your key competitors and just what you think outside of reimbursement changes what the underlying growth rate here just for expectations going forward? Thank you.","Alex Gorsky","Jeff, are you referring to which of our businesses? Our MD&D diabetes business or Invokana?","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Sorry, MD&D diabetes.","Alex Gorsky","Okay. We believe that we have been relatively flat in share this last quarter. We think that there may have been a slight downtick based upon some of the pricing changes that are being made and particularly intrusion of store brands and other offerings. Obviously it's something that we are watching very closely.","Dominic Caruso","Jeff, I want to add, our estimation is that the overall market is declining there. So overall market trends are negative in the diabetes test strips. The market volumes are declining overall.","Louise Mehrotra","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know its getting late. So two very quick ones. Thanks for taking the call. First, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of commentary on your general surgery franchises within medical technology. So I am wondering if you can just comment a little bit more specifically on of those businesses and what you are seeing there because the growth rate in general surgery and especially surgery did look like it was a little better than last quarter. So just a little bit of a commentary there on what you are seeing in those markets and what you are seeing competitively? Is the uptick more of a little better market or is it a little bit more little better market or is it little bit more or less share loss more you can think?","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Look, there's a number of things driving our performance over there. I think, first of all, we saw modest growth overall in the specialty surgery category for the quarter. Our biosurgicals platform had solid growth, particularly outside the United States. We also saw good growth in the U.S. in our ENT business. And while the worldwide energy business continues to grow driven by the continued expansion in new emerging markets and new product launches, we were challenged in the U.S. with our energy business with low cost competitors, as well as some competitive pressures. So, that's the way I would described specialty surgery. In general surgery, of course, our business was impacted by what has taken place and women's health and our decision to exit some of those businesses, so that had negative. We look at suture and some of those basic platforms we are seeing very consistent growth with the overall market that we think it is basically up about 1% or 2%.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then just one quick follow up on an earlier question on emerging markets. I know you talked a lot about how well position you think change is, but just in terms of the outlook for growth of the markets in emerging markets, especially as relates to MD&D, how confident are you that the current growth trends in the market can continue as we look forward over the couple of years. So, again, it's really question of gauging confidence in light of some of the things that have gone on in these economies, in your confidence and abilities of these market, specifically medical devices to continued growth, nice pace we've seen over the last year or so.","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Look, I think there is a couple of forces and dynamics that will be impacting it. You know, first of all, you've got a significant increase in the middle-class populations in those countries. So, for example in China, I think most of the recent statistics would suggest you have about 150 million people in the middle-class. That could go as high as north of 500 million, close to 800 million people over the next 10 years. And, what we also know is that these people move up the economic ladder, they generally consume more health care. And, so we think that the urbanization trend, the trend towards an increasing middle-class does offer a significant growth opportunity.","Now, of course, offsetting that will be pressure put on governments on how they are going to control overall healthcare spending. But if you look at the healthcare spending levels in places like Brazil, Russia, India and China, it's very low single digits. We think that it's an opportunity for them to invest in their society even have a more stable society as well as a more productive society, so we think that the growth opportunities there will continue. We recognize that it's going to take perhaps a different portfolio of products that are really targeted towards specific disease states areas of unmet medical need for those markets. It will take time for different commercial approaches, but overall we do think that emerging markets will be a major source of growth for the next several years.","Louise Mehrotra","With respect to everybody's time, we will take one more question and then we'll have some closing remarks by Alex.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Maybe two quick ones here, Louise, to keep on the time schedule here. First, Dominic, on the cash flow, free cash specifically got better in 2012 versus 2011, I believe. How do you feel about first half free cash generation. I know you don't give specific guidance, but if you just think about free cash versus net income, how do you expect back half '13 and '13 general to shape up relative to '12. And then I had a quick follow-up maybe for Louise, just on ibrutinib any timing expectations can could we see that approval for year end. Thank you.","Dominic Caruso","David, we are pleased with our cash flow generation. And, for the first half of the year, free cash flow is little over $6 billion, so we expect to be well north of $12 billion, which is where we ended last year's free cash flow, so I think we will see '13 overall free cash flow generation better than we saw in '12, and that we are off to a good start already.","Alex Gorsky","Yes. And, regarding ibrutinib, look the NDA, the new drug application for ibrutinib was submitted June 2013, which was announced recently and this was announced by the FDA. We do have the Breakthrough Therapy designation, which we are very excited about for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL, SLL, and we have received at least one prior therapy in patients also with mantle cell lymphoma MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. We got to two pivotal trials that we think are both the very strong and the FDA has not communicated the PDUFA date and the review period is not dictated in the existing breakthrough therapy guidelines from the FDA. Now that being said, we have requested a priority review designation which has an FDA goal for completion of six months after a two-month validation period but we really cannot comment beyond that at this time. All that being said, we think this is going to really offer a great option for patients and for physicians in a very difficult to treat area and be a tremendous extension of our emerging oncology portfolio and franchise.","Louise Mehrotra","So some final remarks, Alex?","Alex Gorsky","Okay. So thanks for your time everybody. On behalf of Dominic, Sandi, Louise and myself and even more importantly from the 128,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson around the world, I would like to close today's conference call by thanking you for participating in the meeting. Your engagement in our business is much appreciated. We look forward to discussing our future results as we move through the rest of the year. So enjoy the rest of summer and thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson second quarter earnings conference call.

Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency increased 2.6% as currency had a negative impact of 0.9 points. In the U.S., sales increased 1.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.1%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.4% worldwide, 2.7% in the U.S., and 4.1% outside the U.S. ","For the full year 2019, consolidated sales were $82.1 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the full year of 2018. Operationally, full year sales grew 2.8%, with currency having a negative impact of 2.2 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 0.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 0.7%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. increased by 5.3%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.5% worldwide, 2.3% in the U.S., and 6.7% outside the U.S.","Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.50 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.12 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.88, representing decreases of 6.4% and 4.6%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3%.","Regarding the full year, 2019 net earnings were $15.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.63. 2019 adjusted net earnings were $23.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.68, up 4.5% and 6.1%, respectively, versus full year 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8.8%.","Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2019 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. ","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.6 billion, growing 2.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.4%, with growth in the U.S. of 1.6% due primarily to strong performance in our OTC franchise. Growth outside of the U.S. was 1.3%. Over-the-counter medicines grew globally almost 5% operationally, and on an adjusted basis. In the U.S., OTC growth was around 10% and is growing share in multiple products, such as Adult Tylenol driven by rapid-release gels, PEPCID, and Zarbee's. However, U.S. growth was aided by about 200 basis points of stocking due to incremental distribution and trade promotion programs.","The Beauty franchise grew 4.3% or just under 1% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of Dr. Ci Labo and the RoC divestiture. NEUTROGENA delivered strong performance globally with growth of 4% outside the U.S. driven by anti-aging and cleansing innovation in EMEA as well as hand and body moisture category strength in the Asia Pacific region. In the U.S., share and market growth were largely offset by lapping of prior year new product pipeline builds and higher 2019 trade investment in NEUTROGENA. ","Concluding the Consumer segment, Baby Care declined 9.3% globally or negative 7% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. This decline was primarily due to continued competitive pressures as well as comparisons to prior year relaunch activities, most notably in the United States.","Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.5 billion grew 4.4%, enabled by double-digit growth in 9 key products. The segment delivered its seventh consecutive quarter above $10 billion in revenue. Sales grew in the U.S. about 4% and increased outside the U.S. by almost 5%. Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U.S. growth by about 180 and 310 basis points, respectively. ","Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at above-market levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of over 10%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing about 45% globally. The U.S. grew almost 38%, with strong growth across all lines of therapy, driven by the new frontline medication for the multiple myeloma transplant-ineligible population. ","The continued strong growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains. IMBRUVICA grew over 26% globally, driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth, primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the U.S., along with strong uptake outside the U.S. In the U.S., based on third quarter data, IMBRUVICA gained above 7 points of market share in CLL line 1 therapy. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 13%, with declines of almost 45% in the U.S. due to generic competition, which was partially offset by continued strong growth of almost 13% outside the U.S. ","We continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, which generated global sales of $116 million in Q4 and $332 million for the full year, primarily in the United States. We continue to grow market share in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, gaining over 2 points in the U.S. this quarter. Sales in the U.S. reflects the first full quarter for the approved indication for patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are also pleased with the launch progress in EMEA where ERLEADA is now available in 12 countries.","Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of just over 6%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of about 16% due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the U.S. to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars. STELARA growth of almost 19% was primarily driven by the Crohn's disease indication, where market shares increased by 6 points in the U.S. versus the fourth quarter of 2018. In October, we received U.S. FDA approval of STELARA for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. SIMPONI ARIA delivered sales growth of 7.6%, driven by strong market growth and SIMPONI ARIA share gains in the U.S. TREMFYA grew over 55% and achieved an 8.3% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2018.","In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing 15%, with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, we continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO. Patient demand continues to build, and the unmet need remains very high. New patient starts continue to steadily increase each month with over 3,500 patients being treated to date. Further, we are pleased to report that in December, SPRAVATO was approved in Europe for adults with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.","In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 9.6%, led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and Juluca for HIV, partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products. In our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 9.5%, primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO was flat with volume increases offset by rebates primarily due to an increase in the legislative rate for the doughnut hole from 50% to 70%, along with higher Medicare and doughnut hole utilization. ","In our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio, sales declined 6.2% as a result of a distributor model change in the U.S. to realize efficiencies by leveraging our distribution capabilities. This change negatively impacted sales growth by about 800 basis points, with sales growth of 2% when adjusting for this onetime impact. We continue to see strong share growth for OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. And when adjusting for the onetime distributor model impact, their worldwide sales were about 10% and 30%, respectively. Portfolio growth was also impacted by declining sales in TRACLEER as a result of continued generic competition.","I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 0.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.7% worldwide. Onetime items negatively impacted growth in the quarter by about 70 basis points, largely related to a bleed down of the forward buying in Q3 in Japan ahead of the consumption tax change, which primarily impacted our Vision business. The majority of this has sold through in Q4, with the remainder expected to occur in Q1 2020. Additionally, on a year-on-year basis, we are pleased to report that Medical Devices has accelerated underlying sales growth worldwide by 130 basis points, with the second half of 2019 delivering 4% growth.","Interventional Solutions grew over 13% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business, achieving about 14% growth worldwide and almost 16% for the year, continuing its trend of double-digit growth for the 11th consecutive year. Growth was strong in all regions, driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters, contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. Additionally, our CERENOVUS business delivered its sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth, driven by strong market growth and new product innovation, including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke. ","Vision grew 0.9% or 3% when adjusting for the negative impact of the Japan consumption tax forward buy I mentioned earlier. Growth was primarily driven by contact lenses, which grew 2.6% globally or 5% adjusted for the bleed of the Japan consumption tax forward buy, led by double-digit growth of daily disposables in the OASYS family. For the year, contact lens grew almost 5%, which we expect to be in line with the overall market, representing the fourth consecutive year that contact lens has grown at or above the market. In surgical vision, we saw continued strong OUS growth in the cataract business due to above-market performance in IOLs, primarily in Asia Pacific. This was offset by weak U.S. performance due to competitive pressures and lower market growth in refractive surgery. ","We continue to see positive momentum in Orthopaedics, delivering growth for the quarter of 1.2%. On an annual basis, each major platform accelerated versus the prior year, and adjusted growth for this franchise improved by 180 basis points. This progress reflects the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance.","Hips grew 4.2%, driven by our leadership position in the Anterior Approach; continued strong demand of our primary stem, ACTIS; and enabling technologies such as the KINCISE Surgical Automated System and Joint Point navigation system. Knees growth was 1.4% in the quarter, driven by strong performance of new innovations such as ATTUNE Revision, ATTUNE S+ and the ATTUNE Cementless rotating platform, which launched at the end of Q3. OUS growth of 3.2% was led by Asia Pacific. Additionally, the United States returned to growth this quarter. ","Trauma growth of 2.5% globally was driven by market growth, supported by strong adoption of newer innovations such as our Femoral Neck System. Spine declined 5.8%, with the U.S. being the primary driver, partially due to not repeating a onetime Q4 2018 favorable pricing-related true-up, which negatively impacted global growth by 250 basis points. Excluding this impact, performance for the quarter was in line with the full year. While we lost share in the quarter, we continue to see positive uptake of newer products and are pleased with the strong start of our newly launched SYMPHONY surgical system for use in posterior cervical spine procedures. ","Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in Orthopaedics. U.S. pure price in Spine declined about 3% after adjusting for last year's pricing-related true-up. Trauma price was consistent with the Q3 decline of 2%. Price in hips and knees both improved compared to Q3 at negative 1% and flat, respectively.","Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced Surgery delivered global growth of over 3%, led by biosurgery growth of about 4% with growth in all regions, led by Asia Pacific share gains and market growth. However, growth in the quarter was tempered as SURGIFLO continued to ramp back up in the United States. Energy and endocutters grew approximately 3% and 2%, respectively, with OUS growth driven by share gains and new products in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by competitive pressure in the United States.","Wound closure grew over 2%, driven by continued strong market growth in China as well as share gains in conventional and barbed sutures. As expected, selling days had an immaterial impact on our global growth rates in the fourth quarter. In 2020, selling days will negatively impact Q1 Medical Devices growth by over 50 basis points, with the majority being offset in Q2. ","I would now provide some commentary on our earnings for the year. Please direct your attention to the boxed section at the bottom of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $8.68 reflects reported growth of 6.1% and operational growth of 8.8%, exceeding the high end of both our reported and operational adjusted EPS guidance range from October, driven by our strong performance. Consistent with our guidance, we did see a slight decline in adjusted pretax operating margins of 30 basis points, driven by investment in digital surgery in Medical Devices.","Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2019 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 170 basis points versus 2018. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment. Medical Devices at 35.4% is higher than the previous year primarily due to increased divestiture gains in 2019, partially offset by an increase in investments in digital surgery. Pharmaceutical margins declined by 200 basis points to 40%, driven by reduced divestiture gains and higher cost of products sold due to the negative impact of currency. Consumer margins improved by 90 basis points to 21.4%, driven by planned prioritization and spending reductions, partially offset by reduced divestiture gains in 2018.","Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019, please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 fourth quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion. Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $1.88, a decrease of 4.6% versus the fourth quarter 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis was $1.91, down 3% versus fourth quarter 2018.","I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly, primarily driven by an increase in amortization expense, partially offset by favorable segment mix. Selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of planned prioritization in the Consumer business and favorable segment mix, partially offset by increased investment in the Medical Devices business. R&D investment was consistent year-over-year with slightly lower milestone payments in the Pharmaceutical business offset by increased investment in digital solutions in the Medical Device business. ","Net interest expense was lower by $50 million, primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements, partially offset by reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances. The change in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by lower litigation expense, higher unrealized gains on securities, partially offset by lower gains from divestitures. ","Regarding taxes, in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 4.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 tax rate of 2.6%. The current quarter includes an estimated tax expense for the transition provisions of Swiss tax reform partially offset by reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries and additional impacts of recently issued regulations associated with U.S. tax reform. We encourage you to reference our 10-K for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.7%, relatively consistent with the same period last year, which was 11.1%.","Now looking at adjusted income before tax. In the fourth quarter of 2019, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29.6% to 27.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the impact of divestiture gains in Q4 of last year. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices declined by 830 basis points, driven by the LifeScan divestiture gain reported in Q4 2018 as well as an increased investment in robotics and digital solutions in 2019. Consumer margins declined by 280 basis points, primarily driven by the divestiture of RoC in Q4 2018. The slight increase in Pharmaceutical margins of 30 basis points was primarily driven by reduced milestone payments. ","That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter 2019. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. ","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky.","Alex Gorsky","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're very pleased to be highlighting our fourth quarter and full year performance. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in 2019, exceeding the financial performance metrics that we set at the beginning of the year. Now we accomplished this while also making strategic investments that advance the pipeline of opportunities and innovation across all 3 of our business segments and as we faced a variety of challenges: from debates about the health care system in our country to uncertainty with global trade, to today's litigious environment, to name a few.","Now I'm very proud that despite the challenges we still remain focused and delivered on our credo, commitments and responsibilities to our patients, employees, communities and shareholders, ultimately driving our purpose to advance health for humanity. And I'm confident that we are well positioned to build on this momentum and solid foundation as we move into 2020 and beyond.","We remain focused on the long term, a mindset we've maintained for more than a century; a mindset that is directly linked to our focused execution, our relentless pursuit of innovation, our talented and passionate people, our culture of caring for the world and our unwavering focus on value creation for all our stakeholders. In fact, I'm proud to highlight that 2019 marked our 36th consecutive year of adjusted operational earnings growth for Johnson & Johnson. Now this performance is indicative of the strength of our broad-based business, and we remain focused on driving the next generation of innovation across our entire portfolio in new markets, in markets where we have greater opportunity to compete and in the markets where we lead, which include our 26 platforms that each deliver $1 billion or more in sales annually.","In Pharmaceuticals, our strong track record of success continued again in 2019 as our pharma segment outpaced the market, growing operationally at 5.8%, which more than offset the loss of exclusivity due to biosimilar competition and generic erosion as well as new competitive entrants and other market pressures. Now it's important to note that our robust growth can be attributed to volume, not price, and our sales growth is a reflection of the increased number of patients we're reaching with our transformational medicines for unmet needs. This strong growth not only enabled us to deliver life-saving and life-changing medicines to people around the globe, but it also enabled us to become the third-largest pharmaceutical company in the world, retain our number one leadership position in the U.S. and be recognized as the number one pharmaceutical company on Fortune Magazine's annual most admired companies list. ","Our pharma investments in R&D continued to fuel exceptional growth as well. We achieved double-digit growth for 10 key products and delivered strong performance across all regions, including in both developed and emerging markets. We're very proud and excited that we gained approval to launch 2 new transformational medicines: SPRAVATO for treatment-resistant depression and BALVERSA for metastatic urothelial cancer. We also continue to maximize the value in our market brands, submitting numerous filings and receiving approvals for line extensions for key brands, including STELARA, DARZALEX and ERLEADA, many with peak sales potential that is greater than $500 million. ","And we continue to expand our portfolio with strategic licensing and acquisition of new assets and platforms, including cusatuzumab from argenx, an investigational antibody for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; a gene-regulation platform for MeiraGTx; and bermekimab from XBiotech Inc., an anti-IL-1 alpha in Phase II development to treat atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. With this industry-leading pipeline, our commercial capabilities and robust R&D productivity, I'm confident that we are well positioned to continue delivering sustained long-term above-market growth in 2020 and beyond","Now 2019 marked a year of significant transformation for the consumer health business. We reestablished our brand and purpose and made strategic decisions that over time will accelerate growth, reduce complexity and improve operating margins. Fueled by science-based, professionally endorsed brands and strong consumer insights, we placed a concerted focus throughout 2019 on establishing a clear plan and path to achieve benchmark profitability in 2020, and the segment is already well on its way, delivering 90 basis points of adjusted pretax margin improvement for the year. ","Additionally, we successfully integrated the acquisitions of Zarbee's, Inc., a leader in naturally based over-the-counter remedies; and the Dr. Ci Labo line of dermocosmetic skin care products, strengthening our position in these higher-growth categories. Our U.S. Consumer business continues to grow above the market, and our priority areas of Beauty and OTC delivered solid operational growth for the year. ","I'm also pleased to share that Medical Devices accelerated growth again in 2019. As a result of our relentless focus on execution, innovation and portfolio management, our underlying growth was just under 4%. Now our improved performance was driven by electrophysiology achieving its 11th consecutive year of double-digit growth, contact lens which delivered growth at or above the market for the fourth straight year, energy and endocutters businesses growing mid-single digits and improved performance in Orthopaedics with each major platform accelerating compared to 2018. ","During the year, we also fortified our commitment and accelerated our entry into one of the fastest growing health care categories and exciting transformative field of medicine, digital surgery. Consistent with our historical pioneering spirit in Medical Devices, we are focused on the next frontier of surgery. The acquisition of Auris Health, Inc., a developer of robotic technologies currently in lung cancer, accelerated our entry into robotics as part of the digital surgery ecosystem designed to make medical interventions smarter, less invasive and more personalized to elevate the standard of care. Additionally, just last month, we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining stake in Verb Surgical to further strengthen our ecosystem. ","Now we also successfully launched critical products across each franchise throughout 2019, including the ATTUNE Cementless Knee system; our first-of-its-kind ACUVUE OASYS contact lens with TRANSITIONS LIGHT INTELLIGENT technology; the industry's first powered circular stapler, ECHELON; and the VIZIGO steerable sheath in our market-leading electrophysiology business. Our team continues to focus on improving our cadence of innovation as well as our portfolio optimization, which included the completion of the Advanced Sterilization Products divestiture and the execution of more than 50 acquisitions or strategic partnerships that we expect will further augment our future growth.","We are committed to building upon this momentum in 2020. And I'm pleased to share that we will be hosting our Medical Device Business Review Day on May 13 to highlight the strategies that we believe will drive further growth and provide additional insights into the team's plans in digital surgery.","Looking ahead, across all 3 business segments, we know we've got more work to do, but we are committed to continuing to deliver above-market growth in our Pharmaceutical business, broadening the reach of our Consumer business and meeting the full potential of our Medical Devices business. And one of the most critical factors in achieving the goals of all of our business strategies is sustaining our investment in innovation. And once again, in 2019, we achieved record levels of investment, investing more than $11 billion in research and development. And across all industries, we remain 1 of the top 10 global companies that invest at the highest levels in R&D and innovation. Across Johnson & Johnson, we recognize the powerful impact that technology, innovation and health care breakthroughs have in creating meaningful change in people's lives and establishing a competitive differentiation within the industry.","Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that all of these many accomplishments would not have been possible without the efforts, passion and engagement of our approximately 132,000 global Johnson & Johnson colleagues who continue to demonstrate a commitment to delivering health care solutions that benefit patients, consumers and communities around the world. Our purpose-driven credo-based culture puts patients and people first, and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees and work to consistently cultivate the world's best, healthiest and most engaged workforce. The fact that our Johnson & Johnson colleagues are truly the driving force behind our successful performance and in fulfilling our purpose is something that we never, never take for granted and always celebrate.","We share the common objective of always making the health and well-being of the patients and consumers who use our products every day our number one priority, and it has been this way for the last 134 years. We are on the front lines of developing medicines and revolutionary products that are literally saving people's lives. And we're working to prevent cancer, offer less invasive surgeries and to end Ebola and HIV. This is what the world expects of us, and this is what our global workforce is united around, committed to and prepared to do.","Now putting the needs of those we serve first also means protecting our shared environment and natural resources. We know that human health is directly linked to the health of the planet. Healthy people and communities go hand in hand with a healthy environment. This is why we are committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, products and supply chain, with 2020 targets to reduce carbon emissions by 20% and procure 35% of electricity from renewable resources. Looking over the long term, we are optimizing our operations to improve water and energy efficiency while focusing on sustainable design and reduction in product packaging as well, all with the goal of delivering better health for people everywhere.","So now I'd like to close where I began. In spite of the numerous industry challenges we faced throughout 2019, I'm very pleased that we remain focused on meeting the needs of patients and consumers globally, delivering value to all of our stakeholders, innovating, driving growth and achieving solid performance. Our sustainable business model is built for the long term and provides us with increased confidence about our business, our strategic direction and the health care industry in what may sometimes feel like uncertain times.","You have our unwavering commitment that we will hold ourselves accountable to fulfill all of our credo responsibilities where we always keep the patient at the center of everything we do and also ensure the continued long-term success of Johnson & Johnson. We have an incredible opportunity to play a leading role in defining and driving the future of health care and putting it within the reach of everyone everywhere. This is why we are so very excited and confident about 2020 and beyond.","I look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming Q&A, but I'll now turn it over to Joe who will provide additional details about our results and guidance for 2020. Thank you. Joe?","Joseph Wolk","Thank you, Alex. Hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's call. I will be providing additional context around our 2019 performance, including our year-end cash position and the capital allocation actions that we executed throughout the year and then conclude with our guidance for 2020.","As Alex and Chris mentioned, we delivered solid fourth quarter results, which capped a strong year of performance for Johnson & Johnson. Our full year results reflect a continued commitment to our long-term strategic objectives. Throughout the quarter and the year, we maintained our focus on delivering life-saving and life-changing products to patients and consumers across the globe. Heading into 2020, we are confident in our overall strategy and ability to drive results across the enterprise that will yield strong shareholder returns. Our solid results during the year generated strong cash flow, our highest level ever of free cash flow, of nearly $20 billion.","With respect to our cash position, at the end of 2019, we had approximately $8.4 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $19.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27.7 billion of debt. Although we don't provide cash flow guidance, for transparency, as we come off a record year of free cash flow generation, we do expect a decline in 2020 of approximately 10% as we are planning for a payment related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation, as previously disclosed.","In 2019, we executed on all 4 elements of our capital allocation strategy. Our first objective within that framework is to invest in growth opportunities to solidify and advance our current business. Delivering transformative health care solutions and creating access is the top priority for Johnson & Johnson. And as Alex mentioned, we invested more than $11 billion in R&D during 2019. ","As investors in Johnson & Johnson know, delivering a competitive and increasing dividend is a capital allocation priority for us. In 2019, we returned almost $10 billion to investors, which is approximately 50% of our free cash flow, increasing the quarterly dividend by 5.6%. ","Once we've satisfied our dividend objectives, we seek M&A opportunities where our capabilities can create compelling value. During the year, we completed a number of strategic acquisitions totaling almost $6 billion to further strengthen our portfolio, which Alex outlined earlier in the call. Finally, after executing on these 3 important capital allocation priorities, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders, such as the $5 billion share repurchase program we began in December of 2018 and concluded in the third quarter of 2019.","Let's move the discussion to guidance and information to assist your financial modeling for the year ahead. I'll begin with some qualitative comments that we considered in our outlook. First, our projected sales growth includes the benefit of an additional 2 to 3 shipping days associated with a 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. This will be partially offset by a SKU rationalization program in our Consumer segment. ","As part of our efforts to further improve profitability in 2020, the Consumer segment will continue to invest in platforms where we have differentiated brands with the greatest potential. Therefore, we plan to rationalize approximately 10% of the SKUs across the global portfolio, translating to a negative impact on 2020 top line growth of slightly over 100 basis points for the segment. This program will be primarily focused outside the U.S., with a larger impact coming in the second half of the year in the baby and Beauty franchises. Considering both the additional shipping days associated with a 53rd fiscal week and the consumer SKU rationalization program, the net impact is approximately 50 to 100 basis points of benefit to the company's sales growth outlook.","Specific to each segment, our adjusted sales guidance also assumes continued above-market performance in our Pharmaceutical segment, driven by continued strong growth from key products such as DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA due to increased penetration and new indications; continued acceleration of sales growth in Medical Devices generated by recent launches and improved execution. And in the Consumer Health business, we will continue to grow above the market in the U.S. while executing the SKU rationalization program to position the segment for benchmark profitability. ","Given these factors, we expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year of between 5.0% and 6.0% or 5.5% at the midpoint. The adjusted operational sales growth of 5% to 6% is on a constant-currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. Considering a negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures, which we estimate at 50 basis points, we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $85.8 billion to $86.6 billion.","As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.11, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4% and 5% compared to 2019 or $85.4 billion to $86.2 billion.","Let's now discuss earnings per share. As you can see on your screen, here's a slide depicting the components and assumptions included in our 2020 EPS guidance. Using the sales growth guidance I just referenced provides approximately $0.40 growth to EPS. The next column is based on expected operating margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points, which translates to an incremental $0.25 of contribution, net of continued investments across our segments. Operating margin improvement will be primarily driven by continued efforts to improve manufacturing capabilities; optimize sales, marketing and administrative expenses; and the consumer SKU rationalization just discussed. This results in strong adjusted operational EPS growth for the core business of $0.65 or 7.5% versus the prior year. ","Offsetting those two operating components is the anticipated reduced level of other income of approximately $0.30 compared to 2019. You may recall that we benefited from a large divestiture gain from the sale of our Advanced Sterilization Products business in the second quarter of 2019. The final element to this EPS waterfall chart is the 2020 benefit we will have from the share repurchase program completed in 2019, which adds $0.05 to EPS compared to 2019, resulting in an adjusted operational EPS of $9.08 at the midpoint or a growth rate of 4.6%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, using recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.03 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of approximately 4%.","Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of additional P&L items to better provide insight into our full year 2020 guidance. As referenced earlier, for 2020, we are expecting our adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 100 basis points while still prioritizing investment in our business that accelerates and further strengthens our pipeline of new products for the long term. Although we are continuously evaluating external value-creating opportunities, for purposes of your models, we currently assume no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash and are therefore comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between 0 and $100 million. ","As a reminder, other income and expense is the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as litigation, investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2020 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. This is lower than 2019 as we had elevated levels of divestiture gains, and we do not expect an event of that magnitude in 2020.","Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate guidance for 2020, excluding special items, is approximately 17.5% to 18.5% or higher than where we ended 2019, driven by expected changes in the mix of global earnings and miscellaneous onetime benefits not expected to reoccur in 2020. Considering all these factors, we are comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $9 to $9.15 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3.7% to 5.4%. Again, while not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to provide some insight on the potential impact on EPS, using exchange rates from last week, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share. Therefore, our estimate for 2020 reported adjusted EPS is between a range of $8.95 to $9.10 per share or $9.03 per share at the midpoint.","As a final comment, our guidance assumes no formal share repurchase program at this time. I wanted to provide this reminder since the last time I looked, street estimates utilized an average share count, which is significantly lower than what we are assuming for our 2020 guidance. We estimate the average diluted shares outstanding to be largely in line with the fourth quarter 2019 share count or 2.67 billion shares. Although we do not provide quarterly guidance, there are a few factors for you to consider in your models beyond the selling day fluctuations Chris mentioned in his remarks for Medical Device. For sales, you can expect the fourth quarter of 2020 to have the benefit of the additional shipping days, partially offset by the consumer SKU rationalization program that we are projecting throughout the year, but more pronounced in the back half.","With respect to earnings, the first quarter of 2019 included an equity gain related to the consumer acquisition of Dr. Ci Labo, and the second quarter of 2019 included the gain associated with the ASP divestiture in Medical Devices. We don't anticipate similar events for other income and expense in the first half of 2020 but would expect elevated levels of other income aligned to today's guidance in the second half of 2020. Lastly, based on today's spot rates, currency will have a more negative impact in the first half of 2020.","That concludes prepared remarks of our financial summary of 2019 results and 2020 guidance. Our 2019 results reinforce our confidence in our broad-based business as we head into 2020, and we look forward to delivering continued value on behalf of all stakeholders.","As Alex mentioned, we will be hosting our Medical Device Business Review Day on May 13, and I look forward to seeing all of you in person at this exciting event, which will be held in New York City this year.","For your planning purposes and based on investment community feedback, please note that we will be highlighting our Consumer segment at consumer-focused events, such as notable CPG conferences this year.","A special thank you to our Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for their tireless efforts and commitment who make the results we have attained possible and the outlook so bright. I will now turn the call back to Chris to begin the Q&A.","Christopher DelOrefice","Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott","Great. The first was just on pharma. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on your expectations for growth in 2020? I guess, specifically, what are you expecting in terms of patent exploration headwinds for this year? And can you also elaborate on the competitive dynamics you're expecting for both TREMFYA and STELARA in psoriasis with the launch of Skyrizi?","Joseph Wolk","Chris, thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. So with pharmaceuticals, as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, we do expect a continued growth above the market. I think, as we would have sat here last year, we expected a bigger impact in 2019 from the loss of exclusivity and generic and biosimilar competition. To our products and to our team's credit, based on the data, the safety, the efficacy, the familiarity of the products and comfortability for physicians and patients, those products were able to retain that business a little bit longer. We would expect that to bleed into 2020. And -- but we still do, even with that, I'll call it, a neutralized headwind. It's not a tailwind per se, but I'll call it a neutralized headwind. Compared to 2019, I think we do certainly expect that the portfolio of products will continue to outperform the general market of pharmaceuticals in general.","Alex Gorsky","Chris, this is Alex. Just to add one comment on to that. Look, we're extremely proud, overall, the performance of our pharmaceutical group, particularly our immunology group within pharma. If you just step back a moment and look over the past several years, at -- first of all, the way that they were able to manage the biosimilar impact with REMICADE while simultaneously launching multiple new indications for compounds like STELARA, launching TREMFYA. To note, that TREMFYA had 55% growth in the quarter, STELARA at 19% growth. And frankly, also, it's the clinical development and the competitive differentiation with TREMFYA, for example, having comparative trials, not only versus our own compounds, but also against Humira and Cosentyx. And I think what's really important is that in areas that -- where these products are used, it's not only the short-term results, but it's particularly important for the long-term results.","So many patients on psoriasis will shift from product to product and are suffering from this condition for a long time and having in excess of 48 months' worth of duration and treatment effect, by a compound like TREMFYA, I think, really helps explain its uptake and continued confidence and use by physicians and patients in the marketplace. So if we combine that with the penetration rate of probably somewhere in the 30% to 40% rate in this overall category, we think that there's still a lot of unmet need. We think that there's still a lot of opportunity with these compounds. And that doesn't even include some of the additional clinical development programs that we're having in areas such as GI as well for these, where, particularly for a compound like STELARA, we're seeing great impact. We think that there is a lot of opportunity ahead.","Christopher Schott","Great. Great. And I can do one other really quick one here. Other income, $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. I think that's still a bit above your historic levels of other income. I know this number can be a bit lumpy, but should we think about this type of level as a new norm or could we think about that number declining further as we look beyond 2020?","Joseph Wolk","Chris, thanks for the question. I would say it's certainly down from what we experienced in 2019. And I would expect not to provide any insights into 2021 just yet, but I would expect that number to come further down as we look out. So as you see, this year, we're improving our operating margins by nearly 100 basis points to offset some of the effect that we had the benefit of in 2019, and I think we'll continue to do that.","But to be truthful, we continually look and manage our portfolio in a very rigorous fashion, making sure that we're the best owners of the assets that we have, and that works both ways. So, we look to complement our portfolio, but we'll also look to take underperforming businesses and create value for shareholders in other ways.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Just one on the extra week and one on the litigation. Joe, can you talk about the impact of the extra week in 2020? In 2015, it was about 4% in Q4, 1% for the full year and neutral to EPS. Does it impact U.S. more than international? Does it impact some businesses more than others? I heard your comments on Consumer, but I'm thinking more about pharma and med tech. And I have one follow-up.","Joseph Wolk","Yes. So Larry, with respect to the fiscal 53rd week, that translates to about 2 to 3 shipping days. I would say that's pretty much the norm for the Medical Device and Pharmaceutical units that you've asked about. It's a little bit less in Consumer in terms of impact because it doesn't impact stocking during the holiday season. So -- and you're absolutely correct. We have the same assumptions around EPS. It's pretty much neutral because you still have a full week of expenses without really the benefit of a full week of sales.","Lawrence Biegelsen","And Alex, just one on litigation. Just what's the latest on the opioid litigation, the latest on the $4 billion settlement you had previously announced? Any important dates, milestones we should think about. And just lastly, on talc, when do you expect the decision from the Daubert hearing? Thanks for taking the questions.","Joseph Wolk","Hey Larry, this is Joe. I'll take that. So thanks for the questions. With respect to the opioid settlement and agreement in principle that was announced shortly after our Q3 earnings, where we set aside $4 billion, we continue to work with the negotiating committee of the state Attorney Generals to finalize the agreement in principle. We remain, I would say, cautiously optimistic that that's progressing very well. We're highly engaged to the extent we can be to finalize that agreement in principle, and we hope to hear more over the coming months from the lead negotiators representing not just the states, but as you know, the counties and municipalities.","With respect to talc and the Daubert litigation, we are awaiting Judge Wilson's verdict in that. Again, as you know, that's an evidentiary standards hearing, so we'll be able to make sure that there's great clarity and certainty as to the type of scientific evidence that needs to be presented, as you know, and you probably saw in the Journal of American Medical Association, the article published just a few weeks ago, probably one of the most comprehensive reports evaluating all studies from independent sources, found no link between talc and cancer. So we think that's, again, another independent source. And we think those facts, those -- that data, that scientific research will bear out in the end.","Operator","Your next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Great. Just a couple of questions this morning. Joe, just one clarification and one qualitative on revenue. So the 5% to 6% operational guidance for 2020, the way to think about that is that includes about 50 to 100 basis points of the net effect of selling days adjusted for the Consumer SKUs?","Joseph Wolk","That's exactly right, David.","David Lewis","Okay. And just a follow-up on revenue. And then one more quick one after that. Just qualitatively, Joe, can you sort of help us understand 2020, how you see it framing up from a Pharmaceutical, Consumer Medical Device business? And historically, you've given us a sense of sort of which businesses are likely to accelerate and which businesses are sort of more stable. So across Pharma or MD&D and Consumer, how do you see sort of the qualitative parameters driving the 2020 guide?","Joseph Wolk","Yes. Thanks for the question, David. So we have, I think, great narratives across all 3 of our businesses. If you look at Pharmaceuticals, we will continue to accelerate growth. I would say we'll be above market. It's probably not as robust as we would have thought this time last year, again, because we were able to retain some of the business that was subject to generic and biosimilar competition. But again, very healthy growth above market. And we'll be looking to complement the portfolio certainly with advancing our pipeline. We've got a couple of things that are -- hopefully will be filed this year around Ponesimod for multiple sclerosis. We hope to gain approval on the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation, which is a tremendous benefit for patients. And we'll see continued uptake of BALVERSA and SPRAVATO.","In Medical Devices, we're very pleased. And just to put it into some context for the analyst community here, in 2017, we grew 1.6%. And in 2018, I'm sorry, we grew 2.7%, and now we're up to 3.9%, and we're not done. So we're going to continue to accelerate growth, be towards that in the middle of the market range that we believe is on the horizon for 2020. And that's before we have the opportunity to launch what we think will be a very differentiated offering around digital robotic surgery.","In Consumer, again, as Alex mentioned in some of his remarks, we have focused on profitability there. We focused putting investment behind our stronghold categories of skin health and self-care. So that would be TYLENOL and MOTRIN for self-care, AVEENO and NEUTROGENA for skin health. Those brands continue to do extremely well. I would suspect we grow more in line with the market for that category, except for the SKU rationalization, where we'll be looking to deprioritize some less productive brands.","David Lewis","Okay. And then Joe, just one a quick question, follow-up on margins. In some of the years, you've had sort of other income headwinds, you've been able to offset it with more significant SG&A gains driving margins. You're talking about, about 100 basis points of margin expansion in 2020. Medical Devices, but the JV agreement continues to track well. Other just spending dynamics and more visibility on sort of the 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion in 2020 headwinds and tailwinds that we should be thinking about?","Joseph Wolk","Yes. I don't know. Chris, do you want to add something?","Christopher DelOrefice","I just wanted to amplify on Consumer. Just examples of that, TYLENOL and NEUTROGENA for the full year this past year. NEUTROGENA at 6% growth. Tylenol, 9% growth, just to build on what you were sharing on Consumer.","Joseph Wolk","Right. Okay. Thanks, Chris. With respect to margin expansion, David, I think we would look to certainly manufacturing capabilities, improving our productivity there. I would point to the consumer SKU rationalization, the design behind that is specifically to improve profitability. And then we'll continue to look at other opportunities for enabling functions across finance, HR, information technology and procurement to get savings. So we think we're in pretty good shape to deliver that for 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Just one clarification. The extra week with the SKU rationalization, it's a net impact overall. It's 50 to 100 to the top line. Is that correct?","Joseph Wolk","That's correct, Kristen.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Perfect. Just want to clarify that. And then just a big-picture, I guess, question, just portfolio and capital allocation. I know you had mentioned just in terms of models need to take into consideration with the share count, no further share repurchase activity. You guys are in a pretty good position, obviously, from a share -- sorry, cash flow perspective, generating $20 billion this year. It sounds like your expectation is to pay out the opioid settlement. But I guess, why not get more aggressive from a share repurchase perspective? Just how should we think about capital allocation going forward?","Alex Gorsky","Kristen, this is Alex. Thank you very much for the question. And look, we're really proud of our strong performance across our businesses. And frankly, as it relates to our capital allocation model this year, and we're very confident in it going forward. As we mentioned in the results earlier, if you think about the free cash flow spin-off that we had in 2019, I think it is indicative of not only great discipline across our various lines. And you see the P&L in front of you. So overall, it was quite healthy. But it's also important to note that we did that in the context of also continuing to invest in more than 11 acquisitions, about 6 licensing agreements, where we invested almost $7.5 billion just in the course of the year.","So as we talked about in the past, we'll continue to invest in our brands and in research and development at an appropriate rate. If you go back over the last 4 years, I think if you add the numbers up in R&D, we've invested more than $45 billion during that time frame. And we think that based upon the number of new product launches in our Pharma, Medical Device business and our Consumer business, that we've gotten a good return on that. We continue to keep a healthy dividend, at the same time, we realize how important that is. During that same time frame, 4 years, it's a pretty similar number to our R&D. It's about $40 billion to $45 billion. And of course, after that, we always take a look at value-creating acquisitions. And again, during that same time frame, I think the number comes to about $50 billion that we've invested.","Over the past year of note was -- you might say the additional investment that we made in Auris, and we think combining that with the later buyout that we did with the Verb -- with Verb and Verily is the right thing. If you think ahead in Medical Devices, there are probably a few things that are going to represent a more secular shift in that domain, then the shift into digital and robotic surgery. And bringing those together, we think, creates a very exciting opportunity for us. But we also continue to do value-creating tuck-in opportunities as well as our Pharmaceutical business. As we just talked about at the end of the year, we brought in 2 really exciting compounds, bermekimab in particular, in both AS as well as other conditions, we think, represents a great opportunity. And it's certainly an area where we've got a lot of capability and a lot of expertise.","And finally, we talk about share repurchases. And I think we've demonstrated over the last 4 or 5 years that we'll certainly employ share repurchases when we think that we're undervalued, particularly in a significant way. And again, I think an outcome of the way that we manage our overall P&L, it means that we can do these things simultaneously. It's not necessarily in order, and we continue to -- we expect to continue that strategy going forward.","Joseph Wolk","Yes. Kristen, just a quick comment out, and thanks for noticing the comments around share count. I have to tip my hat and complement the investment community because when we go through the consensus P&L, the income in terms of absolute dollars was almost spot on. It was eerily close, in fact. And then where the disconnect came in the form of share count, where the average share count used in consensus was about 14 million shares less, which translates to about $0.05 or $0.06. So we thought we were very much in line with what consensus' expectations were. And while we don't provide guidance assuming any share repurchase that's not currently authorized, it seems that a few analysts may have made that assumption.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Joshua Jennings","First is on robotics, and you clearly have put a stake in the ground in with investments. You're pursuing leadership in digital surgery ecosystem. I just wanted to see if I understand we're going to get a big update at the Med Device Day in May. But if you could wet our appetite at all today, just give any updates on progress of the Auris launch, a time line for Orthotaxy? And then any indications that you see where robotics is not in play today that could come into play over the next 3 to 5 years in your portfolio?","And then second question is, just for Joe and Alex, I guess, is just on the other income line has been a focus. I think the concerns are where that could fall up next year within the out years. And when you talk about your process for a portfolio review and then pruning maybe underperforming assets or assets that don't fit under your roof. If you could just talk about that process and how regiment it is? Is there a formula? Is there 1% of the portfolio that gets pruned every year? Or is it just a strategic and opportunistic annually? I apologize for the background noise.","Alex Gorsky","Josh, thank you very much for the question. Look, I'm really glad that you mentioned robotics and digital in terms of an entire platform for us because, of course, that's exactly what it is. And let's start first with our acquisition of Auris Health. And overall, what we would say, it's off to a great start, where we couldn't be more thrilled to have the robotics pioneer and former CEO, Fred Moll and his team at J&J. The Monarch platform is off to a very good start. It's going to play a critical role in our lung cancer initiative. And when you just look at the science and the technology and what it can do with the distal parts of the lung, what it brings in terms of potentially ablation, leveraging it with our NeuWave technology, and even longer term, having the potential to dispense oncolytic viruses in treating cancer in very new and unique ways is exciting. Physicians have performed more than 2,000 bronchoscopy procedures with them on our platform. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing with it.","Second, you saw our announcement on Verb. And we think combining Auris and Verb really helps ensure that we have a very strong role in the next-generation of the digital surgery platform and ongoing development. Our teams are working now together in a really comprehensive way. We do look -- sorry for that feedback. But we do look at this as a platform that is something that will be in place for the next several decades. Therefore, it's really important that we step through this in the right way. And what I would say is the early results from the collaboration and the partnership that we're seeing between these teams is very encouraging. And that's why we're excited to give you this preview that Joe mentioned on May 13 in New York because we think it will provide a very clear, transparent kind of tangible evidence of not only the machines, but also the digital platform component of this as well.","Next, we're really excited about the progress that's being made with VELYS in our Orthopaedics robotics platform as well. It's an exciting technology. We think that it's going to offer a portable, low-cost system that's easy to use, will improve accuracy. It also is a nice combination to ensure the surgeon remains intimately involved. And if we look at the training and technical support, it's something that will be easily coordinated between ORs and surgeons. So we're progressing towards a mid-year 2020 regulatory submission for this. So really, if you just step back and you think about what we have going with Auris and Monarch, if you think about the plans now that we have in placed with VELYS in Orthopaedics, longer term, as we bring out that next generation of digital and robotics platform more broadly across surgery, we're very excited about it.","Joseph Wolk","And Josh, to address your question regarding the management of our portfolio, so I would say it's rigorous. It's not formulaic, though. So we meet as a management team and executive committee monthly on what additions or deletions from our portfolio makes sense. And makes sense probably should be defined in terms of we have aspirations in all the markets we play in to be either number one or number two in that space with the promise of bringing better solutions in that space to patients and consumers across the globe. We have plans in place for all of our businesses to do that. But after a period of time where those plans don't come to fruition, we'll assess other alternatives. I would say, under Alex's leadership, we've gotten very disciplined in this rigor, and that's proved to be pretty productive, I think, in terms of how we've been able to take underperforming businesses, turn that into gains and reinvest back in businesses and areas that we think we've got a differentiated right to win.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Miksic with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Matthew Miksic","So I just had 1 follow-up on one of your business lines in the Med Devices. Then in Orthopaedics, clearly, it looks like you were able to deliver a pretty solid improvement in knees, in the U.S. And I just was wondering if you'd be willing to offer any color on the spine growth within the sort of spine and other category, like which parts of that were the drivers of the decline. And then I had 1 follow-up, if I could, for Alex on digital health.","Joseph Wolk","So thanks for the question, Matt. Good to speak with you. So we are very proud of the knees performance. If you look, that was a declining business in 2018. We've had almost a 2-point improvement there. So the team has done a very nice job. We have ATTUNE both the primary as well as the Revision platform available for patients. We've also made an entry into the cementless side of the business, which, as you know, is the fastest-growing piece of that business. And as Alex mentioned, we look forward to what VELYS could do on the horizon.","With respect to spine, I think you have to take into account the impact of a 2018 U.S. rebate adjustment, which impacted comparative growth about 250 basis points. If you look at the growth, on the U.S., it was probably about half of the decline of what you saw based on that comparison. We continue to see pretty good growth outside the U.S., specifically in Asia Pacific. I don't know, Chris, if there's any other commentary in spine out there.","Christopher DelOrefice","Yes, Matt, I would just say, if you adjust for that, I would say the business has stabilized at low single-digit declines. Where we're seeing success is where we have new innovation, in particular, in degenerative spine with our 3D cage and our VIPER PRIME Systems. I think the next level of improvements will come from SYMPHONY system in posterior cervical, which was launched later this year. So we really didn't get that benefit in this year at all, and we'll expect to see that continued improvement through next year and beyond.","Matthew Miksic","That's great. And then just a follow-up. I appreciate the update and overview on the robotic surgery strategy, Alex. But I guess, one of the things that we've noticed is just how quickly -- and I realize it's sort of a buzz-worthy term, and we see it in a lot of magazines, but artificial intelligence in digital health. For whatever reason, implementation and innovation, but it seems to be moving perhaps the fastest of the categories of digital surgery and digital health. And just wondering, one of your competitors is partnered with a smaller innovator in that space around stroke. I'm sure you're watching it. I'm sure you're making investments and looking at it. I'm just curious if you could give us an update or a preview perhaps of what you'll talk about in the spring.","Alex Gorsky","Sure. Thanks again for the question, Matt. Look, I -- there are few areas across our different innovation or technology platforms that are not being touched by some of this new technology, whether it's AI, whether it's ML, whether it's digital, whether it's the cloud. I mean if you think about just our Pharmaceutical portfolio, for example, and you've talked to Paul Stoffels or Mathai Mammen or Bill Hait, I think what they would tell you is one of the most important areas supporting that is our data sciences' capabilities. And the insights that we can gain from reviewing these large data sets and coming and developing much better insights, frankly, is helping lead us to a much faster and more productive identification of new targets. And it certainly is helping us when we apply those same skills and capabilities of the clinical development programs as you work with hospitals and large medical systems, and you can review medical health records, for example, in a much more detailed way in terms of patient selection and tracking through development. So we're certainly excited about it there.","As it relates to Medical Devices, we've been, I think, very consistent in sharing our thinking that, again, this next generation is certainly about the robotics component that helps facilitate perhaps having more consistency in an exact procedure, perhaps getting into a tighter space, having better access. But we think, longer term, the digital AI component of that in terms of helping preoperatively and developing a very detailed plan, even being applied intraoperatively, in terms of additional guidance systems. And by the way, then that can -- not only to help a surgeon get to a particular area, but it could also be to help him or her stay away from areas that may and could cause a problem.","And then, of course, how that information can be utilized by large health care systems to really ensure that they've got the most effective and efficient and value-added health care delivery programs in place, we think, will be more important than ever. So hence, our reason for partnering with Verb and Verily and Alphabet, in building those capabilities. And again, it's something that more broadly across Johnson & Johnson, we're spending a lot of time thinking about how all those capabilities are going to become more and more part of our doing business, of our doing research and development across each one of our sectors.","Operator","Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy","Just wanted to talk a little bit more about Medical Devices. Specifically, you guys saw a pretty strong sales growth acceleration on an operational adjusted basis this year. How do we think about the next year? I know Ashley have said, in the past, it's not linear quarterly, but I suspect we should be looking for another uptick. Can you help talk about that what specifically will be the drivers in 2020 of that?","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Danielle. Thank you very much for the question. Look, we're -- again, we're really proud of the progress that Ashley and her team has made over the last several years. Joe took you through the improvement from 2017 to '18 to 2019. And we certainly expect that trajectory to continue in the coming years. If I just got to 0 down for a moment, though, on 2019, we saw first half growth of about 3.8%, and we saw growth in the second half at 4%. And while there's a little bit of lumpiness in the quarters, and consistent with Ashley's comments -- and look, we're still taking a look at Q4, we think that the timing of the holidays and a few other things, I think you always have to be careful what you attribute. But if you just look at the number of days between some of those, we think that, that could potentially have had an impact. But it really doesn't change the overall trend of accelerated growth in second half versus first half.","Now if we look at our business, it's really being driven by a number of factors. In our surgery business, what you're seeing is strong performance in areas like electrophysiology, another 14% growth in this quarter with great new technology. We expect a continuous launch in the coming year as well with new products. You also saw good performance in our energy business at just about 3% growth, and biosurgery coming in at about 4% growth. We think one of the growth drivers, frankly, is just overcoming our supply issue in 2020. That probably cut our biosurgery growth rate in half, especially in the latter part of the year. So we think once we work our way through that, that's going to be a growth driver for us. Our CIRCULAR Stapler launch is also going well. We're going to lap the recall as well that we had in the past year. So we think those are definitely drivers in our core surgery business.","If we look at Orthopaedics, here, too, we've seen this steady cadence of improvement. Our knee business, ATTUNE, the launch of the Cementless, the Revision is going very well. And if you think about it, we've turned that from being down almost 0.5% to 1% to growing at 1.4% in this quarter, which, again, shows physicians' increasing confidence in that platform. And we're starting to see an uptake again in ATTUNE primaries, and so we're really pleased to see that. And then, of course, our hip performance coming in at over 4%. Strong trauma at about 2% -- 2.5%, we think is pretty consistent with the market. Chris addressed some of the issues in spine and how we see that moving forward.","And then, of course, there's Vision Care. And I think what we see in Vision Care is fundamentally strong performance in contact lenses. You saw about 3% growth overall in our contact lens business, but what's important to note there is we had 9% growth in the United States. So the transition lens, the astig lens, daily disposables continue to go well. Frankly, we've been disappointed in some of our surgical performance, particularly in the U.S. We've got plans in place to address that. If you look at the ongoing rollout that we're going to have with the TECNIS and the SYMPHONY and the Synergy, we're very optimistic that it's going to make us more competitive, not only in the astig area, but really across that entire platform. So we're confident that that's going to lead to continued growth trends as we go through 2020 and certainly setting ourselves up for even continued growth beyond that as well.","Operator","Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Maybe just two for me. You guys presented additional data at ASH from your BCMA CAR-T program in myeloma and recently got breakthrough designation or planning to file for approval later this year. Would love your initial thoughts on overcoming some of the hurdles faced by other CAR-T drugs and longer term where you see this drug playing a role in the treatment paradigm. The second question relates to the FDA announcement of a meeting next month on testing methods for asbestos and talc. I was just wondering if the company is participating. And then what do you think the key issues that are going to be discussed there?","Alex Gorsky","Sure, Terence. Thank you very much. Let me take the first one regarding the CAR-T data at ASH. As I'm sure you saw when we released the data, we were very excited when we saw those results. And again, here, too, I think it's maybe important to just step back and think about the steps that our team has taken over the last several years regarding CAR-T therapy. And when you look at the different development programs that are out there, how we were able to support or source this from Legend, the way that we were able to accelerate the development time lines, the ongoing and great work that our supply chain is doing as well to ensure that we've got the strong integrity of that supply chain, the dependability that's put in place, we're really proud of the progress they made. And I think the results that we shared at ASH demonstrate our increasing confidence. And by the way, we think this is great news for patients, particularly those who have failed multiple other treatment lines in a very difficult-to-treat condition like multiple myeloma.","And as we think about it going forward, look, we think that this is truly an opportunity to transform the way patients are treated in this space. We've got a lot of confidence in our reimbursement teams. I think we demonstrated in other areas that we can work with payers in a very collaborative way. We're also innovative not only in the products that we're bringing, but frankly, in the reimbursement programs that we introduced as well. And we intend to work just that way with payers and providers both in the United States, but also abroad, ultimately to make sure that this therapy is available for patients that they can get access to it. And that it's not only as effective as the data that you -- that we saw at ASH, but it's also cost-effective to the overall health care system.","Christopher DelOrefice","Joe, do you want to...","Joseph Wolk","Sure. And Terence, with respect to the meeting, I believe it's next month, February 4, regarding testing methods around talc. We certainly welcome any discussion around the safety and efficacy of the product, specifically. We will not be active participants at that meeting. However, I can say that our current internal testing methods exceed that of current FDA standards for cosmetic talc.","Operator","That last question will be coming from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Louise Chen","So my first question for you is, what your view on M&A is this year? And what areas you're most interested in? Is it pharma, consumer or devices or all of the above? And then my second question is how optimistic are you regarding a universal settlement for opioids.","Alex Gorsky","Okay. Let me take the first part of that, Louise. Thanks a lot for the question. Look, I think we demonstrated in 2019, as I mentioned earlier, that we remained active really across all 3 areas. I think we did 11 acquisitions, 6 licensing agreements and putting more than $7 billion worth of capital to work. We have continued, I think, our pattern of tuck-in acquisitions where we get new technologies, as you saw that we did with both XBiotech and other opportunities in our Pharmaceutical business. We would expect to continue that. We also did -- had a fair amount of activity in our Medical Device group, led by Auris that we did earlier in the year.","And then in our Consumer group, of course, that was led by Dr. Ci Labo, which also gave us a great toehold that you might say, into the premium beauty segment, particularly in Asia, but with plans to expand that into the United States. So we'll be looking across all three of our segments, but we would expect there to be an ongoing cadence of M&A activity in those different areas.","Joseph Wolk","And Louise, with respect to the opioid settlement. So we continue to work with the negotiating committee of the state attorney generals to finalize the agreement in principle. I would say we remain optimistic and confident that the agreement is moving forward, but certainly can't predict when that agreement in principle will be finalized. So we'll continue to monitor that, engage as needed and hopefully come to a resolution.","Christopher DelOrefice","Thanks to everyone for your questions and continued interest in our company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Alex just for some closing comments.","Alex Gorsky","Well, thank you, everybody, for your ongoing support across 2019. As we mentioned earlier, we're very proud of our strong performance. But we're even more excited and more confident about what the prospects hold for 2020 and beyond. I think we had a chance to review a lot of the opportunities that lie in front of us, and we look forward to continuing to keep you updated throughout the year as we progress through our plan. So thank you very much, everybody, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

You may begin.","Christopher DelOrefice","Good morning. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the second quarter of 2019. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.","Additionally, during our Q&A session, Joe and I are pleased to be joined by Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Consumer; and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals.","A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.","Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements.

The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last about 75 minutes.","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.","Joseph Wolk","Great, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson. As you might suspect, we're very pleased to discuss our strong third quarter results. Our performance positions us well to exceed the 2019 outlook we provided at the start of the year, providing us with a solid foundation for the future.","During the quarter, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth while also making investments that advance our innovative pipeline across all three segments. We remain committed to advancing solutions that enhance the lives of patients, consumers, employees, and communities, while also delivering value to our shareholders.","In a moment, Chris will provide details on our results, but before he does let me offer some general observations in context about the performance in the third quarter. While there are many headlines surrounding our company as well as the industry, we continue to deliver lifesaving and life enhancing products to patients and consumers, which translates into solid financial performance.","We must recognize that businesses in the U.S. are working in a very litigious environment, but the fundamentals of Johnson & Johnson's business are strong. We remain confident in our ability to navigate challenges and deliver results focused on our mission as we have done for 133 years. For the quarter, our pharmaceutical business even in the face of significant generic and biosimilar competition once again delivered above-market performance across our broad base of therapeutic areas led by double-digit growth in 10 key products.","We are particularly pleased by the progress in the quarter of regulatory approvals and submissions, notably the FDA's approval of ERLEADA for the treatment of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer based on the TITAN data and the approval of STELARA in ulcerative colitis in the EU, additional indications for both of those products.","In our Consumer Health business, third quarter performance reflects continued strength in areas we prioritized earlier this year, beauty and over-the-counter medicines. These businesses are fueled by new product innovations and recent acquisitions in large markets experiencing higher growth, which positions the consumer business to grow competitively [ph]with the market while also improving the profitability of this segment.","Our Medical Device business continues to accelerate growth. We had some tailwinds that Chris will outline, but the adjusted operational sales growth was the best quarterly growth we posted since 2015. Interventional Solutions delivered yet another quarter of double-digit growth, Surgery improved, and Orthopedics progress continues. We have successfully executed multiple launches in the quarter, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue the momentum.","Let me turn the discussion back to Chris for details on the third quarter sales drivers and notable line items in our P&L. I will return prior to the Q&A to provide comments on our cash position and guidance.","Christopher DelOrefice","Thank you, Joe. Worldwide sales were $20.7 billion for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 1.9% versus the third quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency increased 3.2% as currency had a negative impact of 1.3 points. In the U.S., sales increased 1.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 5.4% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.2% worldwide; 3.4% in the U.S.; and 7.3% outside the U.S.","Turning now to earnings, for the quarter net earnings were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.81 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.44 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.12, representing increases of 1.5% and 3.4% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.9%.","Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the third quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2018, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.","Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion growing a 3.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.3% with strong growth in the U.S. of 2.4% due primarily to strong performance in our beauty and OTC franchises. Growth outside of the U.S. was 0.6%. On a year-to-date basis, Consumer grew double digits across all regions in the e-commerce channel. The beauty franchise grew 8.1% or 2% adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of DR. CI:LABO and the ROC divestiture.","Our priority brands, NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance results due to share growth combined with timing of promotions in our club channel in the U.S. Share growth in NEUTROGENA was realized in the facial moisturizing treatment, cleansing, and sun protection categories and AVEENO share gains were due to the hair product line relaunch.","Over-the-counter medicines grew 6.5% globally or just over 5% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the ZARBEE\u2019s acquisition which continues to perform well. In the U.S., OTC adjusted operational sales growth was just over 5% and is growing share. Adult TYLENOL was the core contributor to sales growth and continues to drive significant share growth driven by rapid release gel and TYLENOL arthritis products.","ZYRTEC continued to grow market share. However, sales declined due to lapping 2018 retail stocking due to competitor supply disruption. Concluding the Consumer segment, baby care declined 9.8% globally or negative 8% when adjusted to exclude the impact of the BabyCenter divestiture. This decline was primarily due to lapping retail stocking associated with the Johnson's baby relaunch most notably in the U.S. Excluding the relaunch comparisons, U.S. baby was flat. ","Moving on to our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $10.9 billion grew 6.4% enabled by double-digit growth in 10 key products. Sales grew in the U.S. by 4% and increased outside the U.S. by 10%. Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U.S. growth by about 350 and 560 basis points respectively. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at above-market levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds.","Our immunology portfolio delivered global sales growth of just over 10% driven by strong double-digit performance in STELARA, TREMFYA, in SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA. Sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of Remicade of almost 17% due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the U.S. to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars.","STELARA growth of almost 31% was primarily from the Crohn's disease indication where market share has increased by over six points in the U.S. compared to the third quarter of 2018. TREMFYA grew over 70% and achieved an 8.1% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up about 2.5 points from the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, we filed an application to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of TREMFYA for treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis.","Our oncology therapeutic area delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of almost 9%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing about 57% globally or about 42% when adjusting for the impact of a favorable comparison to the prior year one-time reimbursement adjustment outside the U.S. The US grew just over 26% and continues to benefit from strong market growth and about 3.5 point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy.","The continued strong growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains across the 41 EMEA countries where it is commercially available as well as Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Of note, we received regulatory approval for DARZALEX combination regimen for newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients with multiple myeloma in the U.S.","IMBRUVICA grew 33.5% globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth primarily in the CLL indication in the U.S. along with strong uptake outside the U.S. in the European, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America markets. In the U.S. based on second quarter data across all indications and lines of therapy IMBRUVICA gained approximately 2.5 points of market share and continues to be the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia which gained above 8.5 points of market share in line 1 therapy.","Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 21% with declines of almost 56% in the U.S. due to generic competition which was partially offset by continued strong growth of about 21% outside the U.S. In non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA which gained almost 3 points of market share in the U.S. As Joe highlighted, during the quarter we received approval in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are also pleased with the launch progress in EMEA where ERLEADA is now available in 8 countries.","In Neuroscience our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well growing 15% with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition we continue to progress the launch of SPRAVATO. Patient demand is strong and the unmet need remains very high. To date over 2000 sites have been certified in the REMS program to become a SPRAVATO treatment center and more than 500 of these are actively treating patients with treatment resistant depression.","We are encouraged by the continued progression of treatment centers being certified and treating patients. During the quarter we filed an sNDA in the U.S. for a second indication for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder who have active suicidal ideation with intent.","In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 3.6% led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and JULUCA for HIV partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products. In our cardiovascular metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 4.8% primarily driven by declines in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO was flat with volume increases offset by rebates primarily due to increase in the legislative rate for the donut hole from 50% to 70% along with higher Medicare and donut hole utilization. And just yesterday we were pleased to announce the U.S. approval of an additional indication for XARELTO for the treatment of VTE in the medically ill population.","Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by 0.5% with strong performance in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI growing by about 13% and 24% respectively on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. This growth was offset by TRACLEER, which was negatively impacted by the recent generic entry in the U.S. as well as continued generic competition outside of the U.S.","I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.4 billion declining 2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestitures of LifeScan and ASP, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.3% worldwide. Growth in the quarter was aided by one-time items contributing about 80 basis points to growth, largely related to forward buying ahead of the consumption tax change in Japan, primarily impacting vision business. We expect the majority of this to sell-through in Q4 with the remainder occurring Q1 2020.","Interventional Solutions grew over 14% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business, achieving about 15% growth worldwide, continuing its trend of double-digit growth. Growth was strong in all regions driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth.","During the quarter we were pleased to share the results of the atrial fibrillation progression trial known as ATTEST, which showed that patients treated with catheter ablation were almost 10 times less likely to develop persistent atrial fibrillation than patients on standard antiarrhythmic drugs at three years after study initiation.","Additionally, our CERENOVUS business delivered a fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth driven by new product innovation including EMBOTRAP for the treatment of ischemic stroke as well as strong market growth. Vision growth of 6.1% was driven by contact lenses which grew 7.6% globally led by daily disposables in the OASYS family. As I mentioned earlier, total vision sales were aided by a forward buy in Japan in advance of a consumption tax increase of approximately 300 basis points globally. In surgical vision we launched our TECNIS Synergy intraocular lens, a continuous range of vision intraocular lens.","Orthopedics growth continues to improve with significant acceleration in the quarter delivering growth of 2.3%. It is the largest quarterly growth since 2016. This progress reflects the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance. Hips grew 2.9% driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach, continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS and the KINCISE surgical automated system.","Trauma growth of 4.7% globally was driven by market growth supported by strong adoption of newer innovation such as our Femoral Neck System and Recon Nails. Sales growth was also aided by a one-time rebate reserve adjustment in the U.S. or almost 90 basis points globally. Adjusting for this item, as the market leader in trauma, we are driving growth and expect our performance to represent growth in line with the overall global market.","Spine declined less than 3% with the U.S. being the primary driver of decline. While we continue to see stabilization of performance driven by new products such as the VIPER PRIME System for minimally invasive surgery and our newly launched CONDUIT Interbody Platform with EIT cellular titanium 3-D printer technology to treat degenerative spine disease, we lost share in the quarter.","Knees growth was 2.3% in the quarter with declines in the U.S. offset by strong double-digit growth of 10.8% outside the U.S. OUS results are expected to represent above market performance led by new innovation including ATTUNE Revision and S+. The U.S. market continues to realize positive uptake from the ATTUNE Revision system and in this quarter we launched the ATTUNE Cementless Knee in the U.S. and other select markets around the world.","Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics, but did show modest improvement compared to Q2. However, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms for the quarter. Spine, hips, and trauma, all declined approximately 2% with knees declining about 1%.","Moving to the results for the Surgery business, advanced surgery delivered global growth of over 5% led by strong performance in energy of 8% primarily driven by share gains and new products in the Asia-Pacific region. Biosurgery grew approximately 5% with growth in all regions, particularly the Asia-Pacific region. We were pleased to have brought SURGIFLO back to the market in the U.S. at the end of July, with that one month of being off the market in the quarter, impacting global growth by about 100 basis points.","Wound closure grew almost 5% driven by share gains in conventional and barbed sutures and continued strong market growth in China. Timing of purchases in the veterinary channel favorably impacted global growth by almost 100 basis points. Additionally, we launched the industry's first powered circular stapler for colorectal, gastric, and thoracic surgery, a key innovation for us in our general surgery franchise. As expected, selling days had a minor positive impact on our global growth rates in the third quarter and we do not expect a significant impact in Q4.","I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2019 please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 third quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $0.8 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion.","Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.12, an increase of 3.4% versus the third quarter 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.17, up 5.9% versus third quarter 2018.","I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by negative impact of currency in the Pharmaceuticals business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of favorable segment mix, planned prioritization in the Consumer and Medical Devices businesses, as well as expense leveraging in the Pharmaceuticals business.","We continue to invest in R&D at competitive levels and our investment in research and development this quarter as a percent of sales was 12.5% which is higher than the third quarter 2018 by 20 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by higher investment in our Medical Devices business related to robotics, digital programs and key growth platforms.","The change recorded in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by contingent liability reversal in the third quarter of 2018. Net interest expense was lower by $109 million primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and lower interest expense due to a lower average debt balance.","Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018 tax rate of 11.1%. As a reminder, regarding the third quarter of 2018 the company recorded a favorable financial impact of approximately 9% related to U.S. tax reform. The current quarter includes an estimated tax benefit for the transition provisions of Swiss tax reform partially offset by an adjustment to existing tax reserve positions negatively impacting the effective tax rate.","We encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on this and other specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 20.3% compared to 17.6% in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the adjustment to tax reserve positions previously noted.","Now looking at adjusted income before tax. In the third quarter of 2019 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percent of sales increased from 33.3% to 34.3% in 2019 primarily driven by improvements in selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter as previously noted.","The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. The decrease in Pharmaceutical margins by 180 basis points was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency in cost of goods sold. Consumer margins improved by 450 basis points primarily due to planned optimization of selling and marketing expenses. Medical Devices improved by 220 basis points due to investment optimization and selling, marketing and administrative expenses and other income items which were partially offset by R&D investment in robotics and digital surgery solutions.","That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2019. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the third quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments.","I will now turn the call back to Joe.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks Chris. With respect to cash at the end of the third quarter we had approximately $11 billion of net debt consisting of approximately $18 billion of cash and marketable securities approximately $29 billion of debt. We estimate our year-to-date free cash flow to be approximately $14.5 billion.","We acted upon all four tenets of our capital allocation strategy which are designed to and continue to drive shareholder value. Some of the highlights include investing $2.6 billion in research and development in the quarter, investing in our business delivered transformative healthcare solutions remains a top priority at Johnson & Johnson.","As in previous years we expect to experience even higher levels of investment during the fourth quarter. Some tangible examples of where this investment will be directed, we will be progressing our future digital surgery offerings and R&D activity related to CAR T, cusatuzumab, DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation and line extensions within the immunology portfolio, such as STELARA in lupus.","At the same time, we continue to evaluate strategic transactions that will further enhance our broad-based business and drive value creation, having invested nearly $6 billion this year. We also used cash in the quarter to complete the authorized $5 billion share repurchase program announced just last December deploying $1.2 billion in the third quarter.","I will now provide updates to our guidance for 2019. We continue to see strong results across our enterprise. As such, we are increasing sales guidance and are now comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.0% for the year. This growth would result in sales for 2019 on a constant currency basis of approximately $83.7 billion to $84.2 billion.","We expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures will be between 4.5% and 5.0% for the year. Both metrics are up over 200 basis points at the respective midpoints from the original guidance we provided in January and over 100 basis points from the guidance we provided last July.","Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.10 the negative impact of foreign currency translation is slightly worse than our last guide by 20 basis points and is estimated to negatively impact reported sales by approximately 2.3 points. Under this scenario we expect to report sales growth in the range of 0.2% to 0.7% or approximately $81.8 billion to $82.3 billion.","Moving to items impacting earnings, net interest expense is now expected to be net interest income of $50 to $100 million. For other income and expenses we are tightening the range to $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion. As a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs.","Our effective tax rate guidance for 2019 is now estimated to be approximately 18.0% to 18.5% reflecting the higher end and a tightening of the previous guidance range. Given those updates we are now comfortable with the adjusted EPS guidance in a range of $8.84 to $8.89 per share on a constant currency basis. This reflects operational or constant currency growth of approximately 8.1% to 8.7% which is higher than our prior guidance and reflective of our solid performance this year.","Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of potential impact on EPS using recent exchange rates our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.22 per share versus prior guidance of negative $0.20. Accounting for that, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.62 to $8.67 per share reflecting growth of approximately 5.7% at the midpoint, which is also higher than our previous guidance.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance and are not providing guidance for next year just yet, I will provide a few comments for you to consider looking ahead, both for the fourth quarter as well as for 2020 to better inform your modeling. One notable item for the fourth quarter of this year, you may recall that in the first quarter of 2018 we had an elevated level of adjusted other income of approximately $800 million, primarily due to the LifeScan divestiture. There is nothing similarly planned for the fourth quarter of this year.","Looking beyond the fourth quarter, we are still in the process of finalizing our 2020 plans, but allow me to provide some context for line items where we have some preliminary insights. Qualitatively for sales, we expect our Pharmaceutical business to continue to deliver growth above market. Our Medical Device business is anticipated to continue sales momentum, and we remain focused on optimizing our consumer portfolio for competitive growth, while improving profitability.","In terms of items on the P&L, again, robust plans are still being developed by our leaders, but we will continue to balance improved operating efficiency with investing for sustainable long-term success.","For other income and expense at this early stage, we expect at this time to record approximately half the level of income, just provided in our current 2019 guidance range. We continue to prefer investment in R&D to progress our robust pipeline of assets. This includes continued investment in our digital surgery portfolio, which was bolstered by the acquisition of Auris that we completed in the second quarter of 2019.","For the effective tax rate, based on current legislation, we anticipate the range being relatively similar to the 2019 full year tax guidance I provided earlier, 18.0% to 18.5%. And while we don't forecast currency fluctuations based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to continue to be a headwind, although less than this year's impact.","That concludes our financial summary. I am pleased to be joined on today's call by Ashley, Thibaut and Jennifer to help me address your questions. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I would like to thank our Johnson & Johnson associates around the world for their continued hard work and dedication.","We celebrated the 75th anniversary of our initial public offering at the New York Stock Exchange in September, a significant milestone made possible by their tremendous efforts and those who preceded them.","I will now turn the call back over to Chris to begin the Q&A portion.","Christopher DelOrefice","Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the webcast. As a reminder, I would encourage you to take advantage of Ashley, Thibaut, and Jennifer being on today's call, by directing questions to them about their areas of expertise.","Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning and thanks for the questions. Maybe just Joe, one for you and then one for Ashley. Joe, this is a greater level of financial disclosure we typically get heading into 2020, so thank you in advance. We are just doing some quick math here, it does sound like you're basically suggesting for 2020 outlook, but you are not providing official guidance. Top line should accelerate into next year, and you're pretty comfortable with that kind of relative type of leverage J&J has done historically, which is sort of a earnings growth rate kind of in the 1.5 ratio at earnings relative to sales, is that a decent way of thinking about 2020?","Joseph Wolk","Yes, so David, thanks for the comments. Certainly, glad that you find some of the outlook commentary helpful to you. I do want to emphasize though what I said in the prepared remarks in that it's -- our teams are still working through their plans for 2020. We want to see the momentum that we've seen through this year carry on through.","With respect to top line, I would say, if you recall back in January, we were a little bit more conservative with this year's outlook given some of the ability to hold on to brands that were facing exclusivity risk, ZYTIGA, PROCRIT, TRACLEER. We performed a little bit better. So, we do expect to be above market, but just not as pronounced as we would have thought in the beginning of this year for 2020, but we're feeling very good about the momentum.","With respect to the income ratio to sales growth ratio, I'd say that's a little bit early to comment on. I would expect to see some moderating more back towards -- around sales growth. This year if you look at it, let's just take adjusted -- to adjust it, so accounting for divestitures and acquisitions impact, it's a 1.8 ratio, that's a little bit higher than we typically run at, and then obviously we're going to digest a pretty significant hit on the other income line. So again, the team is working through the plans. We do have ambitious goals for next year. And what I would say is, stay tuned, is probably the best direction I can give you at this point in time.","David Lewis","Okay, maybe just two quick follow-ups, Joe. The first is for you on the repo -- you completed the repo this quarter. Just given the operational performance of J&J and the company's historical discount, what are you thinking now with the share repo completed going forward? And then Ashley, just real quickly, can you just talk a little bit about the U.S. market dynamics within Vision? Two specific dynamics, you talked about pressure in the surgical business, to what extent is that IOL dynamics in the marketplace versus the LASIK franchise? That'd be super helpful. Thanks so much.","Joseph Wolk","So David, with respect to the share repurchase, we are pleased to have the $5 billion board authorized program completed. It continues to be one of the four pillars within our capital allocation strategy. I would say in terms of pecking order, as you know, having covered us for years, it's probably the least of our preferred options, although it is still an option, simply because it doesn't provide us capabilities going forward, but we'll continue to evaluate that along with the dividend increase, the investment in R&D, as well as opportunistic acquisitions that makes sense from a value creation standpoint, but also a really good strategic fit that expands our portfolio.","Ashley McEvoy","And thank you, David for the question on Vision. But before I get to that, I have to first acknowledge kind of the strong quarter for Medical Device in quarter three growing 5.3%. And, as Chris had mentioned, we did experience some forwared -buying in the Japan consumption. So, if you take that out, we're looking at around 4.5% growth, which is the strongest that we've had in four years. So, as you know, we've been on this journey since 2017 to really enhance our performance year-over-year. And when we look at '17, we exited 1.5% growth on revenue, and in '18 we exited 2.6%, and in 2019 to date we're tracking to a little bit north of 4%.","So as I always say, I don't think our growth is going to be linear, but I do think that we've turned the corner, and that really is due to predominantly in the near term, the strategic choices that we're making to strengthen our competitiveness, and it's really about this very strong seasoned leadership team. We\u2019ve got five quarters underneath them, and a very, very strong focus on execution. So I think this is starting to have an effect.","So to your question on Vision; Vision had a good quarter. I would say contact lens in particular had a very healthy quarter, really driven by very strong growth in the United States of around 6%. In surgery, we had very strong outside of U.S. performance, double digits. The U.S. surgical business is challenged really due to two fronts; number one, some competitive inroads and we are working to strengthen our commercial execution.","In U.S., we strengthened that leadership team, revisited our programs, and we are also accelerating some innovations. We expect to have three meaningful innovations in premium IOLs and monofocal IOLs over the next 18 months.","And to your earlier point point, yes, we do believe that we've seen some softening in the LASIK market in the United States. Thanks for the question. David.","Christopher DelOrefice","Great, thank you, David. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe first, can you talk about TREMFYA dynamics, particularly relative to SKYRIZI? The product obviously -- TREMFYA obviously ramping nicely, I know there\u2019s some investor concern though, that that ramp could be impacted by a strong launch from your competitor. So, just how are you thinking about price and volume for that business going forward?","The second question was on liabilities. It seems like kind of these liabilities have somewhat dominated the narrative for the J&J story this year, what do you think the company can do to address that overhang, and what's the company's approach towards settlement? Because it seems like right now the mix of opioids, talc, and some others have overshadowed what seemed to be very strong underlying fundamentals of the company. Thank you.","Joseph Wolk","So Jennifer, why don't you address Chris' question around TREMFYA, and maybe you can give him some Pharmaceutical perspective, and then I'll take up the litigation matters.","Jennifer Taubert","Hi Chris and good morning everyone. First off, it was a really strong quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group, and I just wanted to highlight a couple of key points, the first being, sales of $10.9 billion, 6.5% operational growth. This was our sixth consecutive quarter with sales above $10 billion, and if you take a look at our growth excluding ZYTIGA, it was 10% and also with very strong contribution from the U.S. and the international markets, where actually we had 10% growth outside of the U.S. as well.","Our growth was broadly based with 10 of our key brands growing at double-digit rates, which more than offset the erosion due to biosimilars in generics. Overall, our immunology business was up 10%, our oncology business, up 9%, and Neuroscience, up 8%. A few notable call-outs, STELARA had 31% growth, DARZALEX had 57%, IMBRUVICA 33% growth, TREMFYA, which I'll come back to, 70% growth, INVEGA SUSTENNA 15% and ERLEADA, 95% growth, so very strong performance across our base of business and across our key growth drivers.","Additionally, it was a really nice quarter for the progression of our pipeline, and we had a number of significant approvals, as well as filings that are worth calling out. Most recently as of last Friday, we got approval for XARELTO to help prevent VTE in acutely medically ill patients. We got approval for INVOKANA for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. DARZALEX, we got approval for the combination regimen in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients, and for ERLEADA, we got approval for treatment of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, which expands our opportunity for that product, so that it's not only in the non-metastatic space, but into the metastatic space as well.","We also had a number of regulatory submissions and two breakthrough designations that were granted. So, strong performance for our key growth drivers, and good reasons for optimism on our pipeline progression as well.","In terms of TREMFYA; our TREMFYA business grew 70% versus the third quarter, and in addition, we filed an application for use in active psoriatic arthritis in August, and so to date, we're really pleased with the launch progress and the trajectory.","Based on the strength of the profile of the product that we've got, coupled with very strong longevity data that we have, we believe that we've got a really competitive offering that IL-23 is the right mechanism for psoriasis and other areas that we're exploring, and also, that we've got a very-very strong package to drive continued growth.","I think in these settings before, we've discussed the strength of the package that we have with superiority data versus three separate mechanisms. So approval versus -- in our label, superiority data versus Humira as an anti-TNF, versus STELARA non-responders IL-12\/23 mechanism, and then our most recent data versus Cosentyx, which is an IL-17 and PASI 90 at week 48. And now we actually have four years of data that further demonstrates the therapeutic longevity of the asset, and that's going to be presented next week.","So when you take a look at it, we believe we've got a real competitive profile versus the IL-17. We've also got a competitive profile versus the other IL-23, and we don't see that they're bringing anything to the market that is any different. In fact, based on the strength of our data, plus now our four-year data and the strength of the access that we have in the market, we think that we're going to continue to compete very-very well in what it will arguably be a very competitive space.","Joseph Wolk","Thanks Jennifer. Chris, with respect to your second question on litigation more broadly and what can the company do. So I think it's important, without going into too deep of a litany about the cases that are out there, there's three I'd say headline grabbers that folks have taken notice of. And it is important for me to just give a brief summary of the position on each, because they are unique in their own right.","With respect to the RISPERDAL judgment that you heard last week, first of all, let's make sure people understand the benefits of RISPERDAL, what it provides for psychosis. It has for decades now been on WHO's list of most preferred medicines and the judgment itself, based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent, would suggest it's very egregious. So we don't expect that to stand. We will appeal certainly the amount and you can expect that to come down, should precedent hold.","With respect to opioids, you've seen two divergent paths there for us. So in Oklahoma, we thought that based on the theory of law and which was brought under in public nuisance, as well as the facts that underlie that case, where even the Attorney General of the State said many times during the court proceedings, this is not about Johnson & Johnson, it's about that there is an opioid crisis, where we have less than 1% market share. That's not just for the State of Oklahoma, but across the country. When those facts were ignored and we couldn't find a reasonable settlement approach. We decided to pursue with that case and we are currently appealing that case and have made motions to do that.","In Ohio, you saw something different. We saw a reasonable amount in proportion to other companies that were involved as defendants. We were particularly pleased to see that the funds were going to victims of opioid addiction. And so for many reasons there, we thought the best path for all stakeholders was settlement, and that's something that we will always kind of take into account in terms of what is the best solution for all stakeholders, including investors who obviously want certainty.","Lastly was talc; this to me is probably the poster child for how big a business plaintiff's attorneys have made this type of approach. If you think about the outstanding cases, product liability cases in the U.S. court system today, about 50% are related to life sciences or are against life science companies, when products have never been safer and have never been more effective.","The plaintiff's bar in total has spent over $400 million this year alone in advertising on TV, trying to drum up the numbers in class action suits. It's become a $36 billion industry. And what you may not realize, you'll see the headlines, certainly when verdicts are ruled against us, and I will remind everyone that there is currently not any case that's been fully adjudicated that stands in judgment against us. But last week alone, there were three decisions that were in favor of the company, and you don't see headlines on that.","So in that case, we're going to continue to defend a product that we know to be safe, that we know it does not cause cancer, and that's not just the opinions of Johnson & Johnson scientists, that's the opinion of respected institutions like the National Cancer Institute, the FDA, and numerous prestigious universities.","So we'll continue to evaluate each situation for its unique merits. But what I can't underscore enough is, we've got a small great legal team working on these matters. As today's results hopefully demonstrate to all of you on the phone and anybody who is reading the press release, is that we continue to be focused as an organization of 135,000 associates, trying to bring better solutions, better innovation to healthcare. That will eventually win out. We're very strong in our conviction around that. It has for 133 years. We know how to navigate these matters, and we're going to stay focused at the task at hand.","With that last point, it may be good, sometimes we get a question, especially as it relates to talc, if there's been any overhang on the business. And for that I'd like to turn it over to Thibaut, maybe just to give some quick commentary with respect to the Consumer business and whether he's seeing any impact from it.","Thibaut Mongon","Sure. Good morning everyone. The short answer is no. We do not see any significant effect across the Consumer business. As Joe just referenced, our employees around the world in the consumer sector are hyper-focused on delivering personal health in a very differentiated way, with very strong brands that are rooted in science and endorsed by professionals. In Q3 as Chris highlighted earlier, we delivered solid growth in our key priority areas that we declared at the beginning of the year.","You heard about 5.2% growth in OTC, 2% in beauty, strong performance by brands like TYLENOL, NEUTROGENA, AVEENO. Full perspective to ground you, the baby franchise represents only 12% approximately of our revenues, and approximately 80% of those sales outside the United States, where there is less of an impact from the U.S. events.","So you see the performance of the business. In the U.S., we continue to gain share. In beauty and OTC we are outperforming the market. We are well positioned in segments that are growing 2% to 2.5% in the markets and segments where we compete. You also saw that we increased our adjusted IBT [ph] significantly this year, 210 [ph] basis points so far year-to-date at 22.4%. So we are focused on executing our strategy.","Christopher DelOrefice","Great, thanks Thibaut. Chris, thanks for the question, Rob, next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One for China, - one on China and one on MedTech for Ashley. So first on China, Joe, any color on what you're seeing across divisions there and your expectations going forward? Obviously there has been some concern about the environment in China, and just remind us as to how much China accounts for as a percent of total J&J sales, and I just had one follow-up for Ashley.","Joseph Wolk","Yes sure, Larry. Good to speak with you. So China continues to perform extremely well for us. So if you look - if I strip out significant divestitures of LifeScan and ASP, our overall growth was about 15%. I would say Medical Devices, which we know is the number one company for medical devices in China, we were up around 19%, 14% in Pharmaceuticals and about 5% in consumer, so very healthy across the board.","We have not seen any impacts on tariffs and we don't know of any that are pending around healthcare. So we've been fortunate in that way. We continue to monitor it. The business overall was $1 billion for the quarter. So that's I think a high watermark for that business, as it continues to go fairly strong in terms of growth levels.","Lawrence Biegelsen","That's very helpful Joe. And Ashley, European surgery business has been growing outside the U.S. nicely, but has been soft in the U.S. So my question is, what turned that around in the U.S., and will these recent trends continue until you launch your surgical robot? Thanks for taking the question.","Ashley McEvoy","Thanks Larry. I mean before I kind of get specifically into kind of the surgery business, I do think it's helpful to share - I had talked at the last quarter, some of our hotspots on how do we address some of those, and then will we look at some of the areas that are really on fire.","As Joe mentioned in China, like our Asia business continues to perform double digits, and we actually performed high single-digit, if not double-digit, in all of our franchises, in orthopedics, in surgery, as well as in interventional. And as I talked last time, really, the U.S. is our largest market, how do we continue to accelerate growth there. ","So, I am pleased to see that year-to-date, that business is up around 2.2%, and this time last year, that number was a little bit south of 1%. And then when I look at our global orthopedics business where we are, we do command the world-leading position in orthopedics. We've accelerated that revenue in 2019. So year-to-date that business is up around 1%, really fueled by very strong quarter. In quarter three, up of around 2.3%, which is our strongest quarter since 2016, which is growth acceleration versus a year ago, where that number was about down 1%.","So if I turn my attention to surgery, I would say our energy business has a very strong performance, really double-digit growth OUS. In the U.S., we will be challenged until we get our digital surgery offerings out there. And then similarly for endocutters; endocutters globally had a softer quarter versus the second quarter, really due to some phasing between quarter two and quarter three, and due to a very healthy comp last year, where we grew 10% in endocutters. Similarly, we're seeing very strong performance outside of the United States, high single-digit, but we are challenged versus the robotic penetration happening in the United States.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thank you.","Christopher DelOrefice","Great, thank you, Larry. I appreciate the question, Rob, next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I appreciate all the commentary on Medical Devices. I love to see the growth this quarter. Ashley, just a quick question for you, as we think about that 4.5% growth, you talked about like some one-timers. How should we think about the sustainability of this?","I know there's probably going to be volatility quarter-to-quarter, but just wanted to make sure this level of growth isn't going to fall off for any sort of reason. So I am wondering if you could talk about this, as we look out over the next four to six quarters, the sustainability of that 4% to 5% growth level, or are there any headwinds at any particular quarter coming up that we should be thinking about?","Ashley McEvoy","So thanks for the question. Danielle, and listen, it's really good to see a number four, and we're pleased with quarter three, and we're pleased with really kind of the year-over-the-year enhancement. So I feel confident in that continued year-over-year progression. I don't anticipate us having a perfect linear line every quarter-to-quarter. The market is just - we will have to adapt to the market. But I really think that we're going to accomplish that. What you're seeing is really the benefit of strength in commercial execution. But I would say what I'm equally bullish on, is really the innovation agenda.","And when I look at 2019, I think we benefited from some really novel innovations in our circular -- powered circular stapler for complex oncology cases. We had a first in contact lens with a light adaptive lens. We are launching our cementless, which is a high-growing segment in knees in quarter three. In quarter four, we'll have some news in spine, related to our Symfony launch for our complex posterior cervical and deformity.","So I really think that those are going to have an effect, but equally important is really what I look at the innovations coming out over the next, let's say 18 months. And we're going to have a first-in-kind, smart micro catheter in our electrophysiology business under QDOT, which is going to deliver about two to three times the amount of energy, and take the procedure from four hours to two hours.","We're going to have another novel innovation in Vision, related to the first ever drug-eluting contact lens for allergy. More premium intraocular lens coming, and we're going to have some digital surgery robots in our orthopedics business really beginning with the filing in 2020, let alone all the digital surgery offerings that we have with Monarch and the future with Verb and Eye platform. So thanks for the question.","Christopher DelOrefice","Thanks Danielle. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just as we think about margins, obviously posted a really strong quarter, it looks like Consumer and MedTech were the key drivers of the improvement. Just wondering if that level is sustainable here, or if there is room for further improvement in each of these segments as we look into 2020? And then on DARZALEX looking ahead into 2020, is it reasonable to assume that year-over-year growth in the U.S. should inflect positively next year, given the front-line label? Thanks.","Joseph Wolk","May be Thibaut and Ashley, if you'd like to address your levels of investment with respect to your businesses and then Jennifer you can handle the DARZALEX question.","Thibaut Mongon","Sure, I can start with Consumer, Terrence. On - as you saw, we are very focused on improving our profitability level. I just talked about the sequential improvement we are seeing this year. As I look at 2020, we expect to see moderate acceleration in the topline, with market growing around 3% and we remain focused on driving our productivity agenda. So that's the agenda for 2020.","Joseph Wolk","Yes, I think that the best way to characterize it relative to this year, Terence, is that this year was the bigger lift in terms of profit improvement - profitability margins improving for the consumer unit. So you will still see continued improvement, as Thibaut mentioned, but not to the same degree you probably saw in 2019.","Ashley McEvoy","And just to build, Terence, this is Ashley, on the kind of the investments and what the expectations are, I think we're seeing very strong performance in Asia. We've made continued investment in Asia, and continued investment in China.","We command a leadership position in China and we command leadership position in emerging markets, and it's really nice to see emerging markets up 10% and China up 19% and we will continue to make those very, very select investments.","And then in areas like commercial infrastructure around having a world class sales force and world-class professional education, I think we're seeing the investments that we made, particularly in new deployment models in the United States, having an effect.","And then clearly in innovation, both in digital surgery, through the Auris acquisition, and what we're continuing to do with our Verb and Orthotaxy, and some robotic programs in spine, and as you know, we've invested about $12 billion in M&A since 2017 in Medical Devices to make sure that we're playing in the most attractive spaces.","Joseph Wolk","To be fair Terence, it's a little bit of a tough question for our business leaders to answer at this point in time. As I mentioned at the outset, we're still developing our plans for 2020, and for us, when we go through those planning, we're really looking at what investment opportunities are available to us, in terms of fortifying not just the short term, but the long term. What's going to make us truly competitively advantaged two, three, five years down the road.","So that's why it's a little bit difficult to answer. But we're always looking to make sure that we've got over sustained periods of time, sales growth that exceeds the market in the respective segments, and then profit a little bit better growth than sales growth.","Jennifer Taubert","Hi Terrence. Our oncology business had another strong quarter and DARZALEX was really one of the key drivers of that, with 57% growth versus the third quarter of last year. As you noted, we've got a great opportunity to make strides in the front line setting. Right now DARZALEX is a leader in line 2+.","However, at the end of June, we gained approval in the front line setting for transplant in eligible patients, in combination with REVLIMID and at the end of the third quarter we gained approval in front line for the transplant eligible patients in combination with Velcade and Thalidomide, are based on our CASSIOPEIA data.","And so we're really looking to continue to expand DARZALEX across the various lines of therapy and in various combinations to really be the backbone of therapy. Importantly for us, and I believe the key growth driver for the future, we filed our subcu formulation, which is going to take us from a several hour infusion on this product, down to under five minutes.","And so we think that's going to be an important catalyst for growth, particularly in the outpatient settings, the more community settings, and we're also importantly studying DARZALEX in amyloidosis, smoldering myeloma, so we think that there is both near-term, short-term growth, as well as continued long-term growth potential on this asset.","So based on the strength of the performance to-date, the additional data that we're seeing and the opportunities that we have in the front line setting and growth potential, coupled with the subcu formulation that's coming up, we believe that there is very good reasons for a very strong, continued growth for DARZALEX going forward.","Christopher DelOrefice","Great, thanks Terrence. I appreciate the question. Rob, next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to I guess clarify just some of the timing around the digital surgery platforms. I think Ashley mentioned filing for Orthotaxy in 2020. Just wanted to get some clarification there, and then also any updates on progress with Monarch and then timing around Verb? And I think you might have a Medical Device Day next year, just wondering what we should expect with that, and just kind of Verb and thoughts with Medtronic I guess showcasing their platform too?","Ashley McEvoy","Thank you, Kristen for the question. So listen, I couldn't be more bullish around how J&J is going to create value in this space, and really kind of the goal that we're trying to achieve is really to make medical interventions smarter, less invasive, more personalized, quite frankly to change the standard of care, not just for the next 10 years, but to 20 years and 30 years.","So it really starts with, as you know, a very strong footprint that we actually have today in - as a world leader in open surgery and a world leader in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. I'm very pleased to share that Monarch is off to a great start, as a first in, in endoluminal surgery. We've conducted over a thousand bronchoscopes using the Monarch system.","You'll see in the chest, at the end of October, we will be sharing our post-market surveillance data, and so stay tuned for that. We have a very healthy pipeline with Monarch, for not just lung biopsies, but potentially lung treatment via ablation, and potential treatment via oncolytic viruses, so that program is well on its way. We also are looking at applications of Monarch in endourology for the treatment of kidney stones, and we also are assessing the potential application of [indiscernible] in GI endoscopy.","So very encouraged with Monarch, equally encouraged with the acquisition of Auris as well as Verb. We brought in a new leader to head our Verb program, Kurt Azarbarzin. He's got over 30 years experience in minimally invasive surgery and robotics. It's pretty fun to watch Kurt and the community of Dr. Fred Moll, again one of the founders of Intuitive, Peter Shen, he has grown up on Ethicon instrumentation and then Andy Conrad from Verily, kind of put those thought leaders together with over 30 different key opinion leaders from around the world, who've been really assessing how we can create value with all of these assets over the next several years.","So I am encouraged to say both programs have conducted - and I mean both programs both the [Auris-I] platform and Verb have conducted end-to-end procedures in multiple different indications in general surgery. We've gotten very good feedback from over 30 plus surgeons, and we're going to take the absolute best of all of those, as we in parallel advance both of those programs.","Equally pleased to see Dr. Fred Moll engage with our orthopedics team. We plan to file our orthopedics program for filing middle of 2020. And so, when I take a step back, I really see us having a healthy cadence of news starting last year, with the launch of Monarch, every single year having meaningful news. We are completing our assessment, Kristen, as you had mentioned around the eye platform and Verb and how do we create the most amount of value. Right now, we're not changing any timelines until that assessment is complete, so stay tuned.","Joseph Wolk","Great, thanks, Ashley. And may be just another update to Ashley's point on the progress of the Monarch platform, while it's early and limited revenue today, we're very pleased with the progress of the placement of systems, two times the amount year-to-date versus where we were in 2018. So, that continues to progress well from an adoption standpoint in the marketplace.","Christopher DelOrefice","Thanks, Kristen. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning, congratulations on the strong quarter. I was hoping to start off around on the Pharma business. I just wanted an update on the generic\/biosimilar headwind, you guys have called out a kind of $3 billion number for 2019. And is there any way you can help us think about where that headwind will sit, as we head into 2020? And then the second question, another pharma question just on XARELTO; congrats on the line extension. Any help there, just in terms of how you would perceive launching into this new indication? Are there any pricing considerations you need to undertake and can XARELTO return to growth? It has been a blockbuster that's been relatively anchored over the last number of quarters? Thanks a lot.","Jennifer Taubert","Hi Josh, it's Jennifer. So as we take a look at this year, first on your question regarding sort of biosimilar and generic impact. We think we're seeing about $2 billion of incremental impact from biosims and generics. This is a little bit less than what we had anticipated this year. However, the number of generic approvals and the erosion rates are starting to catch up. And so we think as we enter into next year, we'll work through the rest of that. So part of it - a little bit of it's going to carry over into till 2020, and then we'll be working through and be done with that.","As it relates to XARELTO, we are very excited about the new indication. This is actually the eighth indication for XARELTO and that product really remains unmatched in the oral space, in terms of the number of indications. So the asset has indications in AFib, VTE prevention and treatment, and then also in CAD, PAD.","So how to think about the acute medically ill indication? First of all, it broadens XARELTO's base of indications across these three areas, and it's that's really unmatched. And so that can help from a formulary and from a payer perspective. And then within the market, there are over 7 million Americans that are hospitalized each year with acute medical illnesses and so these patients are at increased risk of clots for up to three months post discharge.","So currently they are treated in hospital, with a product like Lovenox, but because of the complications and the difficulties with injections, they typically go untreated, once they leave the hospital.","What we now know from our studies and our data, is that it's much better for these patients to actually be treated for about 31 to 39 days, following their medical illness. And so this is a - we believe that patients will start on XARELTO in hospital, when they're there with the acute medical illness, and then our goal is a transition out of hospital with a script and continue on oral medication for that 31 to 39 days.","Now you may have the question, how do we go about doing this? The good news is, XARELTO 10 milligram, which is the right dose for this indication, is already available on hospital formularies, that's the dose that we've had in the market now for a number of years, for post knee and hip surgeries. So we do have very broad availability in hospitals, formulary access and also payer access for this.","We've also got teams that are already deployed to hospitals across the other range of indication sets. So in our typical way, we do next day launches. So the team is already out in the markets, getting ready and working on this indication, as well as continuing to drive uptake in the paradigm-changing CAD, PAD indication, and fighting out for a competitive share in both AFib, as well as the other VTE treatment and prevention indication.","So we feel very good that we reached flat this year, that's obviously not where we want to be, but we are moving forward and getting past some of the donut hole and rebate issues, and we do believe there is an opportunity for growth for this asset as we take a look, and completing the year and going forward.","Christopher DelOrefice","Great, thanks Josh. I appreciate the question, Rob, next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matt Miksic","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So just two follow-ups, if I could, one on the digital surgery side, Ashley, I appreciate the color on the strategy across the major business lines. The one that I wanted to ask about was just spine. You have a partnership with Brainlab, and that continues to progress. You have pretty solid set of new products that you mentioned are going to drive improving growth in spine. But just if you could, what amount of the competitive pressure there is coming from this sort of increase in robots in that space, and how do you think about that strategically? And then just one follow-up for Joe, if I could?","Ashley McEvoy","Sure. Thank you, Matt. So spine, we're number two in the world in spine. We have been challenged. Our revenue performance has been challenged, and really what we've been working on is, one to give very dedicated focus to - if I'll call it like the top six markets in spine, that are really going to be the growth contributors in stabilizing those, from a leadership point of view, from a commercial execution point of view, from a clinical acumen of how we engage with spine surgeons and then rebuilding the spine portfolio.","And so, I think we are starting to see the fruit of that on stabilization. And we mentioned some of - Chris had mentioned some of the innovations around VIPER PRIME, around CONDUIT Interbody cages, around Symfony which is going out in quarter four, and so clearly digital surgery is also going to be important that we launch that. To date, that has had a very minimal effect.","As you know and you referenced, we do have a strategic partnership with Brainlab, which is offering us an end-to-end navigation solution, and we actually in quarter three entered into a co-marketing distribution and R&D agreement with Tinavi, who is the market leader in orthopedics robotics in China and actually is the only arm based robotic technology approved for spine in China. So clearly, we feel like we have to have a digital surgery offering as well in spine.","Matt Miksic","That's helpful. And the question for Joe, if I could, just I understand from your comments on the call that you're working through the plan for next year and it's still not a full outlook for next year, but just if you could help us understand perhaps the puts and takes and how you think about spending as you've mentioned balancing near-term to long-term, again some of the year-over-year challenges you may have elsewhere in the P&L that would be super helpful just to maybe walk us through R&D and SG&A and any potential ForEx or opportunities you have in gross margin just at a high level Joe, that would be super helpful?","Joseph Wolk","Yes so, I appreciate the question Matt. I think I'm going to be respectful to the teams on letting them finalize their plans. But I would say in terms of puts and takes I feel very good about the top line growth. We need to see where the net of all the incremental generic and biosimilar erosions will eventually land as we go through the 4th quarter here that will give us a pretty good insight. As you saw, with Medical Devices we expect to be around the markets of 4% to 5% is where we see that market overall.","As you know, some of that is influenced by some of the higher segments where we yet don't have a, I'd say a pronounced presence but working our way towards that. But again, Ashley and the team have their line of sight in continued acceleration there. Maybe as a step back for the overall pharma market, we see about 4% growth for next year. And then in Consumer you've heard from Thibaut that we expect to be competitive with the market, which we anticipate will be around 3%, but the focus there has been on prioritization to skin health and self-care and improving the profitability profile,","We're going to continue to invest in R&D, that's been a bias of ours for a number of years, you can see that when we issue our P&Ls that there is a disproportionate share and that's where we grow as a percent of sales more often than not. And we're going to continue to look for those opportunities to advance the pipeline. I was really thrilled with the press release today, not simply because of the financial results, although, I was very pleased with those.","I would say it was the 15 items that were listed across our businesses of notable advancements in our pipeline and that really just bodes well for the future. So, Matt, I appreciate the question, I apologize, I can't give you a little bit more detailed guidance today, but stay tuned for our report out in January and we'll be pretty specific then.","Christopher DelOrefice","Great, thanks, Matt. I appreciate it. Rob, next question please.","Operator","And your next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Oh, thanks very much for taking the question. Just two really quick ones; given the strength in Medical Devices, I was wondering if you could comment on two quick things. One, you had very strong growth in hips and knees outside the United States. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on what drove that incremental growth? Was it market share, was it market strength?","And then just one last one on Verb, I was just wondering, when you think you'll be able to be in a position to provide us with a more detailed update on the timelines for filing and approval? And I ask in part, because your comments on endocutters, and in part because one of the other large competitors has now provided pretty specific timelines, so, just those two quick device questions? Thank you.","Ashley McEvoy","Sure, thanks Bob. I think I'm pleased with the performance that we've had in hips, around 3%. We have a strong portfolio in hips and we're really leading the way on the anterior approach. We actually just completed a new acquisition of JointPoint, which is going to help us with kind of an intra-operative software program, to enable a more digitally oriented procedure in hips. I'd say hips is pretty balanced between OUS and U.S.","Knees, I am encouraged. This is our first quarter in several quarters that we actually posted growth in knees of around 2%, really fueled by OUS performance. The U.S. I'll come back to that. ATTUNE is performing well in the U.S., we've seen a pivot and start in primary and revision in ATTUNE.","We're working off some legacy transition in some of our legacy knee brands in Sigma. Really what's enabling knees is just a couple of things; one, strength in commercial execution in our top six markets. It's also about innovation. We have a very strong foundation in our ATTUNE knee platform that we've invested over 10 years in bringing to market. It's performing very well from an efficacy and safety point of view. We now have a full portfolio in the ATTUNE Revision, both fixed bearing and rotating platform and we've also launched our cementless in quarter three.","And then you could add to that, Bob, you can see next year when we'll have cementless in fixed bearing, and we'll have our digital surgery offering in knees, I feel pretty confident that our join platform will start to get back to the market performance.","As it relates to Verb, we have been progressing Verb and all of the milestones to bring this to market. We have been preparing for kind of validation studies. We've been in active discussions with all regulatory authorities, both in the United States as well as in Europe. As I mentioned, we brought in a new CEO of Verb, Kurt Azarbarzin, about 60 days ago. So we've been letting him get underneath the hood of what needs more focus, what needs acceleration. Very pleased with, again, the customer feedback from Verb. What we've done is, we've brought in the combination of Auris. There are leaders with Dr. Fred Moll and Kurt and Verily, our partner, Verily are creating kind of this connected OR [ph] of the future, and we're in the middle of assessing how do we really optimize all of these assets to make a difference in healthcare systems.","So we're still in the middle of that, and I expect to have that completed before the end of the year. Right now, we're holding to the timelines, but I expect probably in quarter one with some updates, we will keep you posted. Thanks for the question, Bob.","Christopher DelOrefice","Great, thanks, Ashley. Rob, we have time for one last question, and then after that I will turn it over to Joe Wolk for some closing remarks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford","Hi, good morning. I'll keep it to one question and thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe for Thibaut and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but your International Consumer business seems to lag year-to-date about 1% growth. Can you give us a little detail on why the international growth has been a little slower? And then you've alluded to bit of a pickup in market growth next year in consumer, what are the big factors driving that better growth? Thanks.","Thibaut Mongon","Yes, thank you for the question. Regarding -- as you said, we had a very strong quarter in the U.S., a bit softer outside of the U.S., a number of factors internal and external -- externally we see some softness in some emerging markets, Latin America, especially, and we are rolling out our baby, our new Johnson's Baby brand around the world. The rollout will be completed by the end of this year and this has an impact on our shipments outside of the U.S. In the U.S. we have already completed this rollout last year as we just talked about.","Regarding next year, we anticipate modest acceleration in the markets and geographies in which we compete, from 2% to 2.5% this year to 3% next year. And as Joe just mentioned, we are finalizing our plans to grow competitively in these markets while continuing to work on our profitability agenda, so we can improve our profitability and at the same time invest behind growth opportunities we see in our priority areas.","Great, thank you, Jayson. I appreciate the question. Joe, final comments from you?","Joseph Wolk","Sure. Well, first let me thank all of you on the webcast today for your time and your continued interest in Johnson & Johnson. Ashley, Thibaut, Jennifer, Chris and I were certainly proud to discuss the quarterly results and also engage in discussing the overall health of our business.","What you hopefully saw from today's press release and the discussion that we're about to conclude is that you have a focused organization here on delivering transformational innovation for the betterment of healthcare and much broader society. We manage through any challenges that we face to deliver those results, not just over one year or five years, but many, many years, many, many decades and hopefully you saw that on display today. So again, thank you for your time and look forward to the next encounter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
