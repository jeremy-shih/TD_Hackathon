My name is Cheryl and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. For those participating in the Q&A, you will have the opportunity to ask one question and if needed one follow-up question. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you may begin.","Karen Fletcher","Thanks Sheryl. Good morning and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi, along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss second quarter financial results and provide an update on our 2019 full-year outlook.","Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the remainder of the year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","So with that I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.","Scott Santi","Thank you, Karen, and good morning.","As you saw in our report this morning during the second quarter, we experienced a deceleration in demand across our portfolio. At the total company level, second quarter revenues came in 2% points or approximately $85 million below what they would have been had demand helped at the level we were seeing exiting Q1.","Q2 revenues were down across all seven of our segments versus Q1 run rates with higher declines in CapEx related products, such as welding equipment. EPS came in at $1.91, down from $1.97 last year. In addition to external market factors, known headwinds primarily foreign currency translation and accelerated restructuring expense reduced EPS by 8% year-over-year in the quarter.","Excluding the impact of these headwinds in a couple of small divestitures, this quarter EPS would have been $2 or an increase of 2%. As usual, as the quarter progressed, the ITW team executed well on the elements within our control, operating margin held solid at 24.1% supported by more than 100 basis points of benefits from enterprise initiatives.","Despite negative volume leverage and excluding 30 basis points of restructuring impact operating margin improved 10 basis points year-on-year. The team also managed working capital well as we delivered a 14% increase in free cash flow this quarter. And after-tax return on invested capital was 28.6%.","Based on the data available to us in the fact that we've only seen these slowing conditions for a couple of months, it is difficult to draw any conclusions as to whether this is a pause related to some near-term business tentativeness or something that may turn out to be more protracted. ","And in terms of visibility for us, keep in mind that is a result of the service levels that we provide to our customers. The majority of our divisions are order today ship tomorrow businesses, and as a result we carry very little backlog across the company.","That said, we have had contingency planning discussions with our segment leadership as to the adjustments that need to be made to our plans for the remainder of the year in light of the current operating environment. And as we always do, we are adjusting our full-year guidance in line with conditions on the ground as they exist today.","Current run rates exiting Q2 projected through the remainder of the year would result in an organic revenue decline of 1% to 3% for the full-year. And as a result, we are reducing our full-year EPS guidance by 4% at the midpoint. All other assumptions are essentially unchanged and we continue to expect a stronger second half on a relative basis, as first half headwinds from foreign currency translation and higher restructuring expenses dissipate.","While the combination of a decline in global auto market slowing manufacturing CapEx spending and significant business uncertainty has this operating in a challenging macro environment near term, our efforts over the last seven years have been focused on leveraging the strength and resilience of the ITW business model to position the company for long-term through the cycle performance.","To that end, I would point out that despite the external challenges of the moment, in Q2 we delivered the third highest quarterly EPS in the 107-year history of the company. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, while we will be prudent in making appropriate adjustments based on the near-term demand environment and continue to drive quality execution on the elements within our control, we remain focused on managing and investing to maximize the company's growth and performance over the long term.","Our teams are executing aggressively on our Finish the Job strategy agenda,, and we continue to make solid and consistent progress in positioning the company to achieve our 2023 enterprise performance goals.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Michael to give you more detail on our quarter. Michael?","Michael Larsen","All right, thank you, Scott, and good morning.","In the second quarter,, organic revenue declined 2.8% year-over-year as demand slowed across our portfolio versus demand levels exiting Q1 to the tune of approximately 2% points. Compared to Q1, Q2 year-over-year organic growth rate slowed in all segments with the most significant slowdown in Welding. Like geography, North America was down 2% and International was down 4% in both Europe and Asia Pacific.","Of note, China was down 5% with Automotive, the main driver, and excluding automotive, China was up 1%. You will recall that we previously talked about the first half of the year and Q2 being challenging due to a number of known headwinds , namely currency and restructuring. Those items played out as we expected.","GAAP EPS of $1.91 included $0.06 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact, $0.02 of higher year-over-year restructuring expense and a penny loss related to two small divestitures in Specialty Products. We continue to expect that these first half headwinds moderate in the second half, and I'll provide more detail on the first half-second half dynamics on Slide 9.","Excluding these three items, EPS would have been $2, an increase of 2% versus Q2 last year, which you might recall was a record quarter with EPS of $1.97, it was up 17% versus the prior year. As usual, our execution on the elements within our control was strong. Operating margin of 24.1% improved 10 basis points, excluding 30 basis points of accelerated restructuring impact.","As you may recall in Q1, we made the decision to accelerate this year's planned restructuring projects into the first half of the year, a decision that sets us up well for the second half. Price was well ahead across from a dollar basis and margin neutral for the first time, first time since 2016 as pricing actions continue to more than offset moderating material costs.","Enterprise initiatives were the largest driver again in terms of margin expansion and contributed 110 basis points this quarter with more to come. Free cash flow increased 14% and conversion was 98%, seasonally strong for second quarter.","In terms of capital structure, we opportunistically refinanced our short-term debt and locked in annualized interest expense savings, equivalent to $0.07 a share. And we repurchased $375 million of our shares as planned.","Overall in a softer macro environment than we expected entering into the quarter, ITW team executed well to essentially hold operating margins despite a 6% decline in revenues, grow free cash flow double digits, and deliver EPS of $1.91, the third highest in our company's history, the highest ever being Q2 last year.","Let's go to Slide 4 for some detail on operating margin. Like I said, operating margin was a solid 24.1% as enterprise initiatives contributed 110 basis points. Setting aside the impact from higher restructuring year-over-year, operating margin was 24.4%, a 10 basis point improvement from last year despite negative volume leverage of 60 basis points.","Price cost margin impact was neutral this quarter, thanks to strong pricing and moderating costs. You can see the sequential price\/cost trends on the bottom left side of the slide. And if things stay broadly as they are, price\/cost is on track to turn margin positive in the second half.","The other category has a negative 40 basis points this quarter and includes 20 basis points of one-time items. Going forward, we expect the impact of the other category to normalize in the 10 to 30 basis points range in line with historical.","So in summary, strong execution and margin performance with enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points again. And the enterprise initiatives impact is broad based ranging from 70 to 160 basis points across all seven segments.","In fact in a few slides, you'll see some very strong margin performance in the segments including Polymers & Fluids up 160 basis points, Test & Measurement Electronics up 100 basis points, and Construction up 50 basis points, just to name a few.","Turning to Slide 5. For details on segment performance. As we talked about on our last call, we expected Q2 to be pretty similar to Q1 based on the levels of demand we were seeing at the time we exited Q1. Based on historical data, we expected sales to be up approximately 3% from Q1 to Q2. In actuality, they were up only 1% as we experienced a broad based deceleration in demand as the quarter progressed.","The chart on the left illustrates that point. This is a summary of segment organic growth rates year-over-year in Q1 versus Q2 and to make it apples to apples we equalized the number of shipping days in Q1 and you can clearly see the impact of slowing market conditions across the board with the largest decline in Welding, which was up 5% in Q1 and down 2% in Q2.","At the enterprise level, where we were essentially flat year-over-year in Q1, Q2 ended up being down almost 3%. The decelerating demand occurred from May and June. And after only two months, we don't have enough data points to tell whether this is a pause or potentially more of a sustained slowdown.","That said, our standard approach is to recalibrate our full year expectations and guidance based on the demand levels we were seeing exiting the second quarter, which essentially means that there is no second half reacceleration built into our guidance. We'll get into that in more detail on Slide 10.","Now that's going to be more detail for each segment starting with Automotive OEM and similar to Q1 organic revenue was down 7% compared to the most recent IHS builds down 9% for North America, Europe and China combined.","Despite the fact that this quarter included 130 basis points of Product Line Simplification, nearly half of which related to the ongoing integration of a European based acquisition. This segment still outgrew the underlying markets by comfortable margin. North America was down 6% as builds at the Detroit 3 where we have our highest content per vehicle, were down 6% in the quarter.","In Europe, organic revenue was down 8% essentially in line with Q1, and beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. In China, organic revenue was down 12%. On a positive note, we continue to take full advantage of the long-term growth opportunities in this segment and a new product pipeline and new program wins remain strong positioning us for 2% to 3% of above market organic growth on a sustained basis.","The segment is performing well in the current auto down cycle as evidenced by 22% plus margins despite some pretty sizable declines in revenue over the last four quarters. Operating margin was 22.1% with a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives again this quarter. We'll continue to manage our way through these near-term challenges and adjusting our cost structure as appropriate and focus our positioning the segment for the long term.","Looking forward to the second half, even though IHS is forecasting that auto builds for North America, Europe and China combined will be flat versus down 8% in the first half, we are using current run rates which equate to a decline in builds of approximately 5% in the second half.","Moving on to Slide 6. Food Equipment organic growth was solid up 2% with strong performance in our service business, which was up 4% and equipment of 1%. In North America, results were similar to the first quarter with 2% organic growth with modest growth in the equipment side and service up 4%. Growth in independent restaurants and QSR was solid up double digits, offset by a decline in institutional where we had a tough comp of 20% plus growth in the prior year quarter.","Food retail was a bright spot again this quarter, also up double digits, as the recovery here appears to be taking hold. International organic growth was up 2% mostly on strength in Europe, which was up 4% offset by weakness in China.","Operating margin expanded to 25.6% with enterprise initiatives,, the main driver. Test & Measurement and Electronics, Organic revenue was down 1%, excluding lower sales to semiconductor equipment manufacturers, which represent approximately $200 million. This segment organic growth would have been up 2%.","As we have talked about before, we plan for semiconductor-related sales to be down double-digits this year. And so far things are playing out as expected. Test & Measurement was down 3%, up 4% excluding semiconductor and electronics was up 1%. Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 24.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main driver.","Turning to Slide 7. In Welding as we talked about earlier, we experienced significant deceleration in demand as the quarter progressed. Organic revenue declined by 2% against the challenging year-over-year comparison.","Equipment sales globally were down 4% and the decline was broad based by end market. Consumables were flat. North America was down 3% with equipment sales down 5%, while filler metals were up 5%, suggesting that underlying Welding activity in North America is still fairly solid which is certainly a positive sign.","International markets were flat and operating margin was the highest of our segments at 28.8%. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was flat with Polymers up 2%. Automotive aftermarket was flat and fluids were down 3%. Operating margin was up 160 basis points, driven by enterprise initiatives.","Moving to Slide 8. Construction organic revenue was down 1% due to market softness in Australia-New Zealand, offset by a pretty good results in North America, which was up 2% with commercial construction up 5 and residential remodel up 3. Europe was stable up 1% and operating margin expanded 50 basis points due to enterprise initiatives.","In specialty, organic revenue was down 6% versus a tough comparison of 4% percent, driven in large part by PLS and the performance of potential divestitures in this segment. PLS was almost a 1.5 of which two-thirds relates to a plant closure and the discontinuation of that product line.","Organic growth in potential divestitures was lower in the quarter and reduced the overall organic growth rate for the segment by a little more than 2% points. The remaining core specialty was down about 2.5% against an apples-to-apples comparison of plus 8% in the second quarter last year. By geography, International was down 8%, and North America was down 5%. Operating margin declined due to negative volume leverage and higher restructuring.","So let's move to Slide 9 for a summary of first half financial performance and how that sets us up for a stronger second half. As we've talked about before, we fully expect that the first half to be pretty challenging due to known headwinds and some tough comparisons versus prior year, including the fact that the first half last year was the most profitable first half ever in the history of the company as EPS increased 20%.","As you can see EPS for the first half was 372, which included approximately $0.20 of year-over-year headwinds from both foreign currency translation impact and higher restructuring expense, both factors that will moderate in the second half.","At this point, we have completed about 70% of our planned restructuring for the year and in current FX rates, the headwinds from currency begin to dissipate in Q3 and are essentially gone in Q4. As a result, the $0.20 year-over-year headwind in the first half is approximately $0.05 in the second half, so net positive of $0.15 from these two items alone.","In addition, we have a number of tailwinds to EPS in the second half, starting with restructuring savings of about $0.05 from the first half projects that were accelerated. These are projects with typically less than one-year payback and other than the acquisition integration we talked about in our last call, they relate to our typical 80\/20 front to back activities and are pretty well distributed across the segments. Furthermore, price cost dynamics are favorable, interest expense is lower as I mentioned earlier, and comparisons year-over-year get easier, and we have one extra shipping day in Q3.","So overall, solid performance in the first half with a more challenging near-term environment, and importantly a better set up for the second half with organic growth at the enterprise level in line with the first half at current run rates, margin expansion year-over-year at the enterprise level and across the majority of our segments, strong cash flows and mid to high single-digit EPS growth year-over-year. In terms of the quarterly splits in the second half, we expect Q3 and Q4 to be fairly similar in terms of EPS.","Q3 does have one more day but Q4 has favorability from lower restructuring expense and higher restructuring benefits, as well as no year-over-year currency headwind at current rates. Now let's talk about our updated 2019 guidance on Slide 10.","As per usual process, we are updating full-year guidance to reflect current levels of demand. Run rates exiting Q2 adjusted for normal seasonality project the full-year organic revenue will be down 1% to 3%. This compares to our prior organic growth guidance of 0.5% to 2.5%.","The reduction in organic growth rate from a midpoint of 1.5% to down 2% impact EPS by approximately $0.35. As a result, we now expect EPS to be in a range of $755 to $785 with the midpoint of $770 up slightly 1% versus $760 last year. Lower organic growth also translates to lower volume leverage, and as a result, we now expect that operating margin to be flat to up 50 basis points.","As you saw, we're off to a strong start on cash flow in the first half and the full-year is expected to be strong with conversion well ahead of net income, and we expect to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our own shares for the full-year.","Now a brief update on our portfolio management activities. Our divestiture activities are progressing well and we remain on-track to complete about half of our potential divestitures in 2019. Interest is strong and we expect to realize significant gains and cash proceeds upon divestiture, all of which is excluded from our guidance.","As we have stated before, the positive impacts from the expected divestitures when completed by the end of 2020 include approximately 50 basis points of structural improvement to our overall organic growth rate and 100 basis points to operating margin.","Not counting the gains on sale, we're planning for divestitures to be EPS neutral as any EPS dilution will be offset by incremental share repurchases, above and beyond the approximately $1.5 billion that I just mentioned.","Before I hand it back over to Karen, let me just reiterate something that Scott said earlier. Given the strength of our core competitive advantages, the resilience of the ITW business model, our diversified high quality portfolio of businesses, and our team's ability to execute at a high level, we are well positioned to outperform across a wide range of economic scenarios.","In terms of the near-term macro after only two months, it's too early to tell where near-term demand is headed, and so we're assuming current run rates will extend through the second half. And as we go forward, we'll continue to make the appropriate adjustments incorporating current market conditions and also remain focused on managing ITW and investing for the long term.","So with that, Karen back to you.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. Thanks Michael. So, I think I'll open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Just two questions from me. And first for Scott, so just picking up where we ended on the call, what is the complexion of the cycle. I clearly understand the point that it is very early, you and I both have been around the block a few times. Looking at what you're seeing in some of your leading indicator type businesses or just customer behavior, could you share a little bit of context of how this looks or feels relative to other slowdowns that you've seen? You know what may be looks like a point of worry or what looks like reason to have some level of confidence that this might just be a pause and what in otherwise is a very long extended cycle?","Scott Santi","Yes, I think that look across what we saw in the second quarter. It looks a lot more to me overall at some short-term tentativeness. I think Michael talked about the Welding business data is probably the most tangible data point where we saw a big deceleration in capital investment in the equipment side, but the filler metal business was up solidly mid-single digits in the quarter, which has that our customers are still Welding, the activity level is very high.","And I think that's, if we look at the employment rate in the US, you look at a lot of, it's an environment where overall it looks much more like a short-term pause, some tentativeness certainly impacting capital investment decisions.","You know it's certainly difficult for me to say after a couple of months that that is - it turns into something larger at this point, but we all know that it's a pretty uncertain environment right now, given all of the things going on from the standpoint of global trade issues and concerns and all that.","So I think it's a couple of months, and it certainly was a meaningful data between Q1 and Q2 in terms of overall demand rates, but it is only a couple of months, and it certainly looks in terms of that data point in Welding and some other things like it is some, a bit of a pause, but I don't see anything that says this is the front end of, the end of the expansion cycle for sure.","Jeff Sprague","Now I was just wondering, Michael, if you could clarify the comments you gave us on headwinds and tailwinds as it relates to FX and restructuring saves and the like. I believe those were sequential comments. Can you just clarify that and maybe put that in context of what the year would be?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So that's the first-half headwinds from restructuring and from foreign exchange are $0.20 a share on a year-over-year basis. In the second half those same items, the headwind from that is only $0.05. So incrementally we get $0.15 year-over-year, better in the second half versus the first half. And that is as always assuming that foreign exchange rates stay where they are today.","Jeff Sprague","And that's just relative to the restructuring costs.","Jeff Sprague","Correct? And we've got benefits to think of.","Michael Larsen","Yes, that is, that's a good catch. That's just the cost side. We are getting an incremental $0.05 of benefits from the restructuring activities, the projects that were implemented in the first half of the year as part of this acceleration that we've talked about before. So there's another $0.05 there. You have, if you want to go down this price cost is turning, beginning to turn positive if things stay where they are.","We also have lower interest expense. I said $0.07 annualized. So we'll get about half of that in the second half of the year. We obviously had easier comps year-over-year, even though the organic growth rate is the same at current run rates. First half-second half and then we have one extra day in Q3 that we've talked about a number of times. The straight math on that is that's worth about $0.03 to $0.04, so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open.","Andy Kaplowitz","Michael, we know usually use current run rates when forecasting organic sales going forward, which is to clarify, you do have easier comparisons. You mentioned the extra day in Q3. So is it really just you're being conservative around auto builds because your forecast for declines in the second half is similar to your forecast in the first half? So you've been conservative for auto builds and then everything else kind of stays the same as June basically is how you do it?","Michael Larsen","I wouldn't say we're being conservative. I think this is purely a mathematical calculation. We're taking existing run rate exiting Q2, projecting those into the back half of the year. And if you do that, we get to, if you do the math, our first-half was down 2% organic, we're saying the full year will be down two and therefore the second half will also be down two, but there is no subjective input to that calculation.","Scott Santi","Keep in mind, Q1 was flat. So we are basically projecting exit Q2 run rates, not first half.","Michael Larsen","That's right. These are Q2 run rate. Yes.","Scott Santi","Which is why you get to even year-on-year with the extra day.","Michael Larsen","Yes.","Andy Kaplowitz","And then if you look at the specialty products, you talked about that divestitures there. But maybe if could you give us a little more color, obviously the detrimental there, a little bit weaker than the other segments. I think in the past you've talked about some tariff related headwind on that business. So could you talk about sort of what you're seeing? Is it specific to your appliances there? What's going on in that business?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think, similar to the other businesses, we did see a slowdown in demand, but really the bigger delta, which is down 6% is what I was trying to explain with the higher PLS, the divestitures in the core business being down 2.5. On the margin side, I mean the enterprise initiatives were good. The drag is really volume leverage and then higher restructuring and that's, those are the key drivers of the margin performance.","There is really no real trends that we can point to inside of these businesses that we can tie back to some macro factor. It's really broad based, lower demand in those businesses with a lot of PLS. We're working on the divestitures and so that's kind of the story on specialty.","Andy Kaplowitz","But the step that Michael, you haven't seen with it with the 25% tariffs anymore impact on the margin side compliance or whatever. It's just, there is obviously uncertainty out there on the sales side, but no impact on the margin side, in that segment.","Michael Larsen","That's correct. I mean this latest round of this 3 going from 10 to 25 really had a material impact on the company overall we're talking pennies of EPS and well managed and really that goes back to were largely a produce where we sell company and that's also true for specialty products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","I'm just curious if you'd comment on price cost and by segment, what's your thoughts on how your ability to full pricing in an environment where demand is weakening and some of your input costs are probably declining particularly in 2020. Is there any segment in particular where we might see pressure on the business to give up pricing in the lower volume environment.","Michael Larsen","No, I mean we do have a number of divisions with index pricing. Of course, those will have to adjust to contracts. But there is really when we look across the board here price continues to improve in Q2 relative to Q1. On a dollar basis and that is true across the board.","As you know, automotive is a little bit more challenging. Just given the way the contracts are structured, but across the board. We're really pleased with the price performance and we're entering into more of a normal pricing environment I say we've neutralized the cost impact including the modest tariff impact we just talked about and this issue for now as things there, they are essentially behind us and to be very specific, there is no actions to give price back really all we were trying to do is cover our material cost increases as those increases went through.","Ann Duignan","Okay, thank you, good color and\u2026","Michael Larsen","We expect to have answered most of it going forward.","Ann Duignan","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe you could comment on what you're seeing out in the marketplace. I know you talked about maybe a pullback in capital spending, but it was interesting to see that you're automotive aftermarket business was flat and I would have top of that was tied to consumer discretionary spending, which has remained resilient versus maybe business CapEx. So maybe just talk about what you're seeing in that business in particular.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean there is not much automotive aftermarket has been a grower in the low single digits here and I think there were a couple of things, there is a small portion of their sales that is tied to overall automotive production. But beyond that, there is this business correlates more to miles driven than anything else and we didn't really see much of a, there will be changes in this segment in this, in this business in the quarter.","Ann Duignan","Okay, so no kind of the consumer slowing down I think what we can.","Michael Larsen","No, I think we. And the thing I would add that there is some within quarters in that business. There are some impacts from the launch of new programs or new product launches. So I think overall the demand there our view is pretty positive. Overall , in Q2, but we can certainly go back and take a look at whether there is a specific issue related to a prior year launch. But it's they got as much said the longer sort of full year trends there are up really solidly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","So my first question maybe just high level, and if we were to just go into a little bit more of a prolonged downturn, you guys historically have done a great job of taking costs out. I'm just wondering like how do you guys think about how much there is left within the organization to continue to take cost out. And then secondly, just from a strategy perspective, do you feel like you need to shift at all from really like that the focus on growth to really cost at this point of the cycle?","Scott Santi","Well, I think overall, we have a couple of things going for us. And when they're, when we're seeing some pressure in the marketplace. The first is that we have a very flexible cost structure. We've talked about that before, given our 80\/20 operating model. And the historic performance that you referenced is really built around the fact that we have the ability to move up or down, capacity up or down.","I won't call it easily, but I would say we have the ability relatively quickly to adjust our cost of the current environment. I think we showed that to some degree in Q2, and certainly we would expect that we will go through the back half of the year.","So I would describe that is tactical. I would also describe our ability from a cash flow generation standpoint, and the margin profile that we've now got as a company that will allow us in a downturn to stay invested in the things that we think are really critical to the long-term growth and performance of the company. And that's a very different dynamic perhaps and we - from a overall position standpoint that we might have had in some of the prior downturn.","So, I'm certainly very comfortable in our view is that we will make prudent tactical adjustments in the near-term and be able to both do that and stay invested in the things that we really think are the important things for us to be focused on and investing in from a long-term perspective.","Joe Ritchie","I guess and Scott, maybe just following on that question really just from the cost levers, like where do you think that there is still kind of opportunity within the organization? I know you guys have highlighted. You've simplified the organization. You've highlighted sourcing as an opportunity before. So, where do you see the opportunities today?","Scott Santi","Well, I think we've talked about before, we are - we would kind of certainly a ways to go from the standpoint of our enterprise initiatives. We've got 100 basis points this quarter. There is easily several more years of work there and opportunity there. It depends on your, we're talking about the next 2 or 3 years that certainly is a lever that we will continue to access. And as I said before, the other is that we will adjust our capacity very flexibly in the cost associated with supporting their capacity.","So, I think we've got plenty of levers and it also depends on sort of the magnitude of the sort of environment in the ups and downs that we're dealing with here. So our, what we would do I think is our intent is to be very responsive to the environment as we see it in the short term while staying invested in the things that we think are really critical to the long-term performance of the company. And I don't know how to be more specific.","Joe Ritchie","Okay.","Scott Santi","Yes.","Joe Ritchie","No, that makes sense. If I could ask one question just quickly on growth. You guys, I like the slide that you had showing Q1 versus Q2. I'm just curious, it sounds like June certainly took a leg down to the extent that you guys can kind of quantify and I may have missed this earlier, just the order of magnitude that June was down that would be helpful.","Scott Santi","Yes, it's June was I mean we really started to see the decline in May and in June, mid-single-digit I would say in June year-over-year, and at the same time going into July here, we are starting to see things, certainly not get worse and stabilizing maybe from what we saw exit in Q2, which again supports our view that run rates are a good way to look at this on a go-forward basis. So, until we see something different.","Michael Larsen","Until we see something, yeah. So June was the, the more significant leg down, July looks like things are stabilizing as we sit here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open. Steve Volkmann, your line is open. If you're on mute, please unmute your line.","And we'll move along. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO.","Joel Tiss","I can't believe I made it. How is it going guys?","Scott Santi","Why do you say so?","Joel Tiss","Cheers. Two questions, just one, I know you said that it's a little bit too early to tell and I just wondered if the way you're characterizing sort of a little bit of amplification of slowdown in May and June and stabilizing in July, is there any way to tell and I know you guys are hand to mouth, but is there any way to tell if your customers demand was sort of impacted you know kind of like the amplified a little bit from inventory destocking or there is not really anyway to tell? You know what I mean so that the underlying markets is better than what the number show.","Scott Santi","I think we're a tough parameter for you and you know the fact that we deliver at the kind of level of responsiveness that we do means our customers have to carry relatively low amount of inventory. So to the extent there was any inventory adjustment, it's probably not a particularly material number for us.","Joel Tiss","But I meant for them, like your customer demand went down because their customers are reducing inventories. Okay, maybe will do...","Scott Santi","We can't tell.","Joel Tiss","Too much of attending? Okay. Can you give us a little bit of an update on your pivot to acquisitions and where we stand and what you're thinking and how your, how your team is building and how you're seeing with prices and all that? Thank you.","Scott Santi","Sure. I don't want to get carried away here, but we have certainly as we talked, going back to our last Investor Day, we have certainly begun the process of starting to explore. And we certainly are ready to, as we talked about begin to supplement the portfolio with nice high quality acquisitions.","I would say we have made appropriate efforts in terms of communicating that update of our strategy to the appropriate people and have had pretty interesting change in terms of flow of ideas and opportunities. So, we are certainly looking at a number of things.","The pipeline is sort of quickly rebuild. I don't want that in, in any way tip any or give anybody an indication that there's anything imminent there, but we're certainly starting to explore a range of potential opportunities, and we expect that over the next 12-months or so that we will generate some activity there. But it's all a function of quality fit and sort of afford let's call it affordability, doesn't, can we get, let's get and what we think it is the right value for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Top line question during the quarter and going back to the Investor Day, you talked about 6% of revenue and divestiture process last year to date It up to the Investor Day seeing of 4.6% drop. With the latest weakening, did that and did that pool of revenue associated with the divestitures, did that see a sharper decline than the overall ?","Michael Larsen","Yes, so , Andy these are rightfully characterized as long-term growth challenged and we're certainly seeing a performance in those businesses that are below the kind of core ITW.","Scott Santi","And that you talked about specifically specialty.","Michael Larsen","Specialty is a good example of that where we called it out.","Andy Casey","And then the gross margin was flat in the quarter year-over-year despite the revenue drop. I just wanted to, did any of the restructuring fall into gross profit?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So I think there is both the 80\/20 activities and obviously the sourcing activities and so I think it goes back to what we talked about earlier, just the resilience of ITW with a 6% decline in revenue is half of which organic the other half currency, we're holding margins above 24% and we're holding gross margins.","We generate more cash in terms of the conversion rate, and so I wouldn't say we were, that was not a big surprise to us that we were able to do that, that's kind of, that's how we run the rail on the railroad here, so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Hi, there. I don't know if I missed this, but when you're talking about the back half of the year, by the way I'm looking at Slide 4 right now at your price cost discussion there. What exactly is embedded in your guidance at this point for a price cost tailwind? And can you help us in Q3 versus Q4, is that kind of how your assumptions play out ?","Michael Larsen","Yes I think if you look at the trend of the bottom left of the slide, we would probably expect that trend to continue into the back half of the year if things stay the way they are, from a cost standpoint.","Mig Dobre","All right, but is there going to be like a 50 basis points tailwind, Is it 100 basis points? What's, what's the right magnitude?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think a more realistic view is that it begins to turn slightly positive in the second half here. And beyond that I can't really give you a number.","Mig Dobre","Well, I mean I figured that you would know since obviously this is one of the key elements in terms of the swing. The first half versus back half, and I get it, it's hard to forecast it perfectly but--","Michael Larsen","Let me just Mirc. Just because I don't answer your question specifically, doesn't mean I don't know the answer. I just want to be clear. So it's just a - we have never provided quarterly guidance on price cost and given the dynamic environment we're in and it's I would put it this way.","Overall, it's not going to be a material driver to our performance in the back half, but it certainly contributes and relative to where we've been over the last three years, it's no longer a drag, which I think that's really the big story here. The price cost has been neutralized. In terms of price dollars, we are significantly ahead of the material cost side, including the tariffs we talked about. So hopefully that helps.","Mig Dobre","No, it does. Fair enough. If I had to try. Then let me, let me ask my follow-up on growth, right. I think everybody kind of understands what's going on with auto, but I was wondering, some numbers here, even if I take out auto. I think your organic growth was down something like 0.7% year to date. And I look at this and that almost feels like a recession type environment.","So I guess I'm wondering from your perspective, when you're looking at the remaining businesses excluding auto, you know how much of this decline is generated, has been generated by businesses that you actually looking to exit per Andy's question from earlier versus what's going to stay, what's going to remain in the portfolio? And do you sort of feel like you've got kind of the right portfolio mix in the right geographical exposure at this point or do you need to make maybe some more significant adjustments down the line? Thanks.","Michael Larsen","I think in terms of the big, if you look at it by segment, automotive accounts for the vast majority of the decline in revenues year-over-year, I think that's well understood. We're kind of being hit by a number of things here, including and we've talked about semi and now this slowdown in Welding.","So, I think it's a little bit about, little bit of an unusual time for us. Usually we have things kind of moving in different directions. But like I said auto is the majority. Then we have this unique situation in Specialty where the divestitures are underperforming. We're still doing a lot of product line simplification and then Welding took a step down here in Q2. So, yeah.","Scott Santi","And I'll answer the same question from a longer-term perspective, which is if you look at the margins we generate in every one of these seven businesses, what that tells me is we deliver a lot of value for our customers in those, in every one of those businesses.","In every one of those businesses, we have significant share and penetration gain potential, and we expect, as we've said many times before and we are working on it by creating every one of those businesses to outgrow the underlying markets by 1% to 2% percentage points plus. Some have the potential to do be more, some less.","But every one of them should outgrow their underlying market growth. And we are working through sort of lots of all things we've talked about before in our path to get there, but I have no doubt we will get there.","Mig Dobre","All right, thank you.","Michael Larsen","Thank you.","Scott Santi","And supplement it with a couple of nice bolt-ons when we get there as well a year maybe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Just one, two follow-up questions. Just one on the Welding side. Could you just provide some color which markets were, end markets were hit hardest? And then I was impressed with the ability to hold the margins. I mean, they were down modestly over year but given the organic growth decline, I thought margins would have deteriorated more. So was there anything unusual in that number, and how do I think about margins for the year? Thank you.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So I think on Welding, the decline was fairly broad-based. If you look at, so the equipment side down, for consumables flat and the filler metals is up 5, like we talked about. So that's certainly a positive. The industrial side of Welding in North America, it was down kind of in the mid-single digits, and was the biggest driver overall. The commercial side, as we've talked about before, did relatively better than that, and then the last data point oil and gas kind of was flat in the quarter, so.","Scott Santi","What I would add is in the equipment decline, industrial was certainly the bigger decline relative to the commercial end.","Michael Larsen","Yes.","Scott Santi","So manufacturing.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, it's really the industrial economy here is what we're seeing the softening demand. And because we are shorter cycle and Welding is one of these, receive the order today and ship tomorrow. We see it maybe faster than other companies that carry more of a backlog. You have to keep in mind that in Welding since we're on that topic, we carry less than two weeks backlog, because of the best-in-class service levels that we provide in that business.","So, and then I think on margins, I'm not sure. Well, you were talking about Welding specifically, I mean I think certainly if margins at 28.8. If you take out the restructuring and Welding they were actually positive in the, in the quarter as well up year-over-year.","There was about 60 basis points of restructuring in the quarter. And I think it's back to the resilience of the of ITW and given how we're organized, our teams on the ground when they see things slowing. They are able to react quickly and make appropriate adjustments and deliver.","If you look at the decrementals for ITW in the quarter, we are in the mid 20's, which is given that we saw the slowdown late in the quarter, I think it's pretty really strong performance. And as we talked about earlier, we expect that to continue as we go into the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","You know that amount of 24.3 just to be precise. So it's pretty good. So, in that regard, you know, as we kind of went through the quarter. How satisfied are you that you're preserving the investment spending to get to kind of accelerate growth when the markets return to growth or are we sort of in the zone now where it's all about margin preservation and some of the investment spending kind of get the 3rd? I mean how do you think about that?","Scott Santi","We are, we talked about our contingency planning discussions that we had with each one of our segments and the first topic was the conversation around what are the things that we are going to absolutely stay fully invested in as we go through this a little bit of a, of a rough patch in terms of demand.","And I'd sort of go back Nigel to what I said earlier is sitting here with mid-20's EBIT margins with a business that as we model it would have to shrink by a 3rd in some unprecedented economic depression for our margins to drop below 20% suggest to us or not suggest, it puts us in a position where we are absolutely able to ride the cycles, power our way through these cycles and stay invested for the long haul.","So I am. There are, there are certainly tactical adjustments that can be made in terms of managing capacity appropriate in the short run rates around demand. Again, I talked about our flexible cost structure that helps us move up or down in debt from that standpoint as demand moves up and down.","But from the standpoint of capacity to invest and desire to stay invest, we're not trying to be a hero based on decremental percentage. We're trying to build a company that over 5 and 10 year period can outperform based on the core strengths that we have in terms of the business model, the end market positions where in.","And the things, I don't want to get too detailed on this, but the things we've talked about in terms of sales capability building in terms of new product innovation, all of those things are part and parcel of the conversations that we've had with each of our segments in terms of the things we are absolutely going to stay invested in as we write this out.","Nigel Coe","And then just a quick follow-up on kind of taken a different approach to the price cost question, looking at gross price and have you seen any pushback or increasing sort of investments and incentives in any of the businesses? And I'm thinking here about auto, it's obviously gone through a real rough patch. And how is pricing looking in that end markets? And Welding is another one where we've seen some chatter about deceleration in pricing maybe just address those two and perhaps overall as well.","Scott Santi","Yes, I think overall, this is a general statement with millions of products. But I think that all the work that we've done in the portfolio, we've talked about this before. We are in many, in the majority of our businesses, we are in spaces where we're doing something unique and value-added for our customers, which gives us some ability to price based on the value we deliver, not based on a commodity reference points.","It's not to say that those, there aren't pressures in certain end markets as you talk about, but our responses to try to find a way to give the customer better value, not necessarily reduce the price that we're seeing or serving. So, we are doing things in auto every day to design products that help our customers to be more efficient in how they manufacture to give them better performance in terms of features and benefits.","So, we're not certainly immune to the pressures at the moment as much as I would say we have from the standpoint of the differentiated nature of the product portfolio. We have multiple responses and ways that we can respond to that over time to again deliver value to our customers. We still get paid for the value that we deliver.","Michael Larsen","Right. And I'll just add Nigel one data point before, and it was a question earlier and if I didn't say clearly. Our year-over-year price, if you look at in dollar terms was higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter. So, if there is some nervousness around the ability to maintain price, hopefully that data point is helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","John Inch","Good morning, Michael, Scott and Karen. So the 55% of the ready to grow, growing, presumably have some model in there obviously. If you were to strip that out, how did that roughly speaking, how did that do in the second quarter? What's kind of the growth rate there for those businesses and sort of how are you thinking about them in the second half ?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think it's a good question, John. When we talked about this at Investor Day last year, I think we described it as a journey. And so what we were going to do is report on our progress on an annual basis. I can tell you we're certainly making progress in those businesses.","We are having movement of businesses that were not ready to grow, not growing category that are moving up. Maybe the Service business in Food Equipment is a good example of that where we are now putting solid 3% to 4% organic growth on the board at, by the way really attractive margins as I'm sure you know.","Scott Santi","But I would also say that that list was chock-full of Welding businesses, so to Michael's point to try to calibrate this on a single quarter given the macro influences it's, this is a data point that we are certainly comfortable being accountable for in reporting out, but on an annual basis is a better way to reflect our progress in that regard.","John Inch","So it's fair to say though the choppiness, the CapEx deferrals et cetera that are going on, is that making it harder to do deals, meaning is the sort of the end-market demand choppiness and there's obviously project push outs not applicable per se to your company but it's affecting CapEx. Is that causing for a little bit of deal disruption in terms of the discussions you're having, or looking to begin to have?","Scott Santi","Not yet. And there is no prediction. Actually not yet. It hasn't really been a major focus but yeah it's been a couple of months.","John Inch","Just lastly. Michael, you said that even the guide doesn't assume a re-acceleration, but what if there is a deceleration obviously which I realize you can't forecast nobody really can but it holds to reason things sometimes move in trends, and Scott your, I take your comments obviously. I get it right, this is probably ultimately just some kind of pausing but if it's not, how should we think about sort of ITW's resilience or what kind of sensitivity is there if in fact there is further deceleration?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, I think if things decelerate from here we will give you an update in the third quarter. I think what you saw in terms of kind of the decrementals are a good way to think about how the company would, that we saw in the quarter a good way to think about how the performance might play out. There is one other data point in the materials today. You saw we adjusted our organic growth guidance down.","Every point of organic growth is approximately $0.10 a share so and then you can and I think we're pretty transparent in terms of all the information that we provide, including at the segment level and then you can build your own models and those decrementals by the way are fairly similar across all of our segments. So hopefully that helps you model the sensitivities around, around the top line.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Karen Fletcher for closing remarks.","Karen Fletcher","Okay, thanks Sheryl, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s third quarter 2017 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our third quarter financial results and update you on our 2017 earnings forecast.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you on slide two that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2016 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Santi","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, all. In the third quarter, the ITW team continued to execute at a very high level and as a result, delivered another quarter of strong financial results.","Q3 earnings were $1.85 per share, which includes a $0.14 per share benefit from a favorable legal settlement that Michael will discuss shortly. Excluding the impact of this legal settlement, earnings per share increased 14% year-on-year, and operating margins increased 130 basis points to 24.4%, with Enterprise Initiatives contributing 110 basis points of improvement.","In addition, we continue to make good headway on organic growth acceleration with continued progress on our organic growth initiatives across all seven of our segments. Year-to-date, our organic growth rate of 2.7% is more than double last year's rate despite the fact that two of our fastest-growing segments, Auto OEM and Food Equipment, are experiencing a little bit of market softness.","Based on our solid Q3 results and a fairly stable near-term end market demand environment; we are increasing our full year EPS guidance as we now expect to grow full year earnings by 14% at the midpoint, and that's excluding the 17% per share full year benefit from the legal settlement.","Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the progress we are making in leveraging ITW's differentiated business model and high-quality diversified business portfolio to deliver consistent top tier performance. We look forward to updating you on our strategy and long-term performance goals at our Annual Investor Day on December 1.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q3 performance and 2017 forecast. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thanks, Scott. I'm on Slide 3 and I'd like to start the financial discussion today by separating the impact of the legal settlement from our underlying operating performance in the quarter.","The schedule on Slide 3 lays out the key performance metrics as reported, including GAAP EPS of $1.85, the impact of the legal settlement, you can see the $0.14 benefit to EPS here and all the metrics excluding the legal settlement, with EPS of $1.71, an increase of 14% versus prior year.","When I discuss our financial results for Q3 on the following slides, all of the results presented and my supporting commentary exclude the impact of the legal settlement.","Okay. So, I'm on Slide 4, and as I mentioned, EPS increased 14% year-over-year to $1.71 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.09, with $0.06 contribution from margins and $0.03 from currency translation. As you may know, we've met or exceeded the midpoint of our EPS guidance every quarter since we began executing on our enterprise strategy five years ago.","Total revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 4% with organic growth of 2%, which was right in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Six of seven segments had positive organic growth, led by Specialty up 5% and Welding and Construction, which were both up 4%. By geography, organic growth was strong internationally, up 4% led by China, which was up 13% and Europe was up 2%.","As we discussed on the last earnings call, this quarter had one less shipping day, and in addition, Product Line Simplification ran a little higher than usual and was a 70-basis point drag on our organic growth rate in the quarter.","Adjusting for these two items, the underlying organic growth rate is closer to 4% on an equal day basis. Just to remind you that the calendar for Q4 also has one less shipping day which is factored into our guidance.","We increased the operating margin by 130 basis points to 24.4%, a new record for the company, driven by our continued progress on enterprise strategy initiatives and positive volume leverage. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of margin expansion, and we continue to have strong momentum on our Strategic Sourcing and 80\/20 initiatives.","Operating income grew 9% to $881 million, making this quarter the most profitable quarter in the company's history. Free cash flow was solid at 108% of net income, in line with typical seasonality, and it's worth reminding everyone that we raised the annual dividend by 20% in August. Overall, another strong high-quality quarter as the ITW team continues to leverage our highly differentiated business model to consistently deliver top tier results.","On slide 5, we've laid out the key drivers of our 130 basis points of operating margin expansion this quarter. Enterprise Initiatives continue to be ITW's main driver of margin expansion as they contributed 110 basis points of structural margin improvement, marking the best quarterly performance so far, this year.","Volume leverage was 60 basis points and as expected, price\/cost was unfavorable 40 basis points, due primarily to higher steel costs, which impacted a few segments. For comparison purposes, please keep in mind that we do not include Strategic Sourcing savings in our price\/cost calculation. Those are reported separately as a part of the Enterprise Initiatives savings number.","If we were to include them, price\/cost would have been positive and accretive to operating margin in the quarter. As in prior quarters, we more than offset the cost side with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We expect that price\/cost for the full year will be positive in dollar terms by $30 million to $40 million and unfavorable by approximately 40 basis points to the margin percentage. Overall, really strong operating margin performance, record operating margin performance, in fact, in the quarter.","On slide 6, on the left side of the page, you can see what Scott mentioned earlier, the solid progress on organic growth versus last year as reflected by our year-to-date organic growth rate of 2.7% and positive organic growth in all seven segments. Our growth rate of 2.7% is more than double the 1.2% we did in full year 2016 despite the fact that we were expecting a little bit of softness in two of our fastest-growing segments.","In terms of operating margin, you can see the results by segment with meaningful sustainable margin expansion as six of seven segments have improved margin on a year-over-year basis.","Test & Measurement and Electronics is leading the way in 2017 with 320 basis points followed by Welding up 230 basis points and Specialty up 200 basis points. As expected, Automotive OEM margins are down due to the margin dilution impact from the acquisition of EF&C last year. Excluding the 160 basis points of dilution from EF&C, Automotive OEM margins are up 20 basis points to 24.3%.","I will now discuss the segment results starting with Automotive OEM, which delivered organic revenue growth of 1% in Q3 and grew above market in all key geographies as we continue to increase our content per vehicle. In North America, revenue was down 7%, which was better than the decline in auto builds, which were down 10% overall and down 14% at the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content per vehicle.","Outside North America, growth continued to be very strong, with Europe up 8% and China up 10% versus market growth of 5% and 1%, respectively. The most recent IHS forecast for Q4 auto builds calls for more moderate declines year-over-year, including down 3% in North America and down 9% at the D3. As a result, we now expect full year organic revenue growth in our global Auto OEM segment of approximately 4%, pretty solid considering a second half decline in North America of 7% overall and 12% with the D3.","Turning to slide seven. Food Equipment organic revenue this quarter was flat overall as strength in international markets was offset by market softness and difficult comparisons due to the timing of new program rollouts in North America.","North America was down 4% with equipment down 6%. However, international equipment was strong, up 6%. Operating margin remained solid at 27.3% despite a little bit of a slowdown in the organic growth rate.","Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue grew 1% as Test & Measurement grew by 4%. In the Instron, where demand is tied more closely to the CapEx cycle, organic growth was up 3% as the positive trend continues from the first half of the year. Electronics was down 3% due to a tough comparison versus last year when the business was up 13% due to some one-time large equipment purchases.","Operating margin performance was very strong at 24.1%, an improvement of 310 basis points driven by Enterprise Initiatives. As a reminder, the 24.1% includes 300 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets.","Turning to slide eight. The positive momentum in Welding continued with organic growth of 4% in Q3. By geography, North America was up 8% with equipment up 10% and consumables up 5%.","Our industrial equipment business, which sells primarily into manufacturing, including automotive and heavy equipment, was strong, up 11% in the quarter, while our commercial equipment business, which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication, farm and ranch customers, was up a solid 5% year-on-year. International was down 11% due primarily to oil and gas. And keep in mind though that international only represents approximately 20% of our Welding segment.","Operating margin was solid at 26.6%, but was negatively impacted by increased restructuring costs in Europe. Excluding these added restructuring expenses, operating margin Q3 would have been up 70 basis points to 27.3%.","Polymers & Fluids revenue improved 1% organically with automotive aftermarket up 1%. Fluids, which primarily sells highly-engineered lubricants and cleaners into industrial and commercial end markets, was up 4%, driven by demand internationally.","Polymers, which primarily sells engineered adhesives and sealants for industrial MRO and OEM applications, was down 1%. Keep in mind that the 21% operating margin number includes 400 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets.","On Slide 9, Construction Products organic revenue was up 4%. And demand in North America was solid with organic growth up 4% as residential led the way with 7% organic growth. Commercial, which is about 20% of our North American construction business, was down 3%. Europe and Asia Pacific was solid, both up 3%.","Operating margin performance was very strong at 25.4%, which represents 280 basis points improvement year-over-year, primarily due to volume leverage and Enterprise Initiatives. Finally, in Specialty Products, organic revenue was strong, up 5% led by the international side, which was up 7% and operating margin was the highest in the company at 27.7%, an increase of 160 basis points due to volume leverage and Enterprise Initiatives.","Let's turn to Slide 10 and our updated guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. Starting on the left side of the page, we're showing the as-reported numbers, which include the full year impact of the legal settlement.","As a result of our strong Q3 results, we're raising our full year earnings guidance by $0.25 to a new EPS range of $6.62 to $6.72. And the $0.25 increase reflects the $0.09 beat from margins and currency in Q3, $0.14 from the legal settlement and $0.02 from higher operating margins in Q4.","At current levels of demand, we expect full year organic growth of 2% to 3%, more than double our 2016 organic growth rate as all seven segments are poised to deliver positive organic growth for the full year.","ITW's key performance metrics for the year are expected to be all-time records for the company. Excluding the legal settlement, we expect EPS growth of 14% at the midpoint and operating margin of approximately 24%, an increase of 150 basis points, with Enterprise Initiatives contributing 100 basis points.","After-tax ROIC is expected to be approximately 23.5%, and free cash flow is expected to be greater than net income. As you can see, we are projecting another strong year for ITW, a record year.","Finally, turning to the fourth quarter, our EPS guidance range is $1.55 to $1.65, an increase of 10% at the midpoint. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year, we recorded a $0.06 EPS benefit from a special dividend related to an investment. Excluding this item, our fourth quarter EPS guidance represents 15% earnings growth at the midpoint.","Finally, we expect organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% and as always, we're factoring current foreign exchange rates and current levels of demand into our forecasts.","So, with that, we'll now open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open.","Andy Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Scott Santi","Hey Andy.","Andy Kaplowitz","Can you give us a little more color regarding what's going on in Food Equipment? Obviously, U.S. restaurant seems to be a little weak. It's still a small portion of that business for you guys. Did institutional get a little weaker in the quarter? And you did mention the timing of shipments impacting quarter, so how are you thinking about the potential for recovery in the business at this point moving forward?","Michael Larsen","Right, Andy. So clearly, we've seen a little bit of pullback here on the demand side. If you look at it in North America, the equipment side, down 6%. If you look at it by end market, the institutional side was only down slightly, down 1%. And restaurants were actually positive for us, up 1%. And if you'll recall in the last quarter, restaurant was actually down 7%. So, restaurants were up 1%.","And then the retail side is where we had the comparison challenge in terms of product rollouts last year that didn't repeat this year in the retail side, which was the scales and the weigh wrap equipment was down 13% on a year-over-year basis.","Andy Kaplowitz","So, Mike, do you see these parts of Food Equipment recovering here, or how should we look at it over the next few quarters? I know in the last quarter, you have said sort of 2% to 3% growth moving forward, but obviously, it's been a little weaker.","Michael Larsen","Yeah, I know it's -- you're right, it's been a little bit weaker than expected, and based on what we're seeing in the business, we're not expecting anything very different in Q4, which as always, is based on current run rates. So, we're not seeing anything to suggest that these markets are coming back in the near term.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay. That's helpful. And then Scott or Mike, maybe you could just step back and assess the pivot to growth here in 2017. I know you talked about generating something like 130 basis points of higher organic growth this year versus last year, which is good.","But as you move forward here, I mean, the global economy has clearly improved a bit. I'm not sure that you're going to generate 200 basis points above market this year but the goal was for exiting next year. So how does that look at this point, especially if a business like Food Equipment is a little bit slower?","Scott Santi","Well, I think overall, what I would say is we certainly are getting much better balanc across the portfolio. Keep in mind that there is \u2013 and this is just repeating something you already know, but there has been an intense focus on a lot of the restructuring initiatives going on inside the company related to our Enterprise Initiatives. 85 divisions across the company all starting to make this pivot, all of them in various \u2013 in different stages in terms of making that turn.","But I think the encouraging part in terms of what we see is that we're getting better balance across the portfolio. All seven of our businesses are improving in terms of their year-on-year organic growth rate. But it's not a matter of just simply flipping the switch. It is a matter of making a progress on the things that they're focused on internally and then making the shift in terms of the relative balance of effort, energy, attention and investment around growth initiatives. And those are all transitioning across again 85 different divisions across the company.","So, I think as we look in terms of our progress to date, I think Michael talked about it, I think our \u2013 the fact that we've been able to get the organic growth rate up better than a full percentage point this year relative to last year with the two businesses that were generating the fastest organic growth for us being in -- experiencing some challenging near-term market conditions, I think, overall feels pretty good.","And certainly, understanding what's going on inside these businesses and the kind of progress they're making in terms of this turn, I think we're set up well for another -- we'll talk about 2018 in December so we won't get ahead of ourselves, but we expect continued progress in 2018.","Andy Kaplowitz","Scott, I don't want \u2013 I know you don't want to get ahead of yourself, but do you still feel confident about accelerating organic growth, lower POS as you go into 2018 and generally momentum from the businesses from pivot to growth?","Scott Santi","Yes, I feel confident that our -- we'll be able to make another step change improvement in overall organic growth rate in 2018 relative to 2017.","Andy Kaplowitz","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","I know you don't really guide quarter-by-quarter, but I'm just wondering it seems that you're not expecting Food to get better anytime soon. So, I'm just wondering if maybe you could just sort of broaden that out in terms of 4Q, the 2% to 3% organic, maybe just throw in a specific comment on Auto. Given the interest there, how do you see the segments relative to the 2% to 3%?","Scott Santi","Yes. I think for Food Equipment, first, Nigel, I would expect a growth rate in Q4 on a year-over-year basis that is similar to what we just had here in Q3, maybe a little bit better than Q3 based on current run rates. I think for the Automotive business, the organic growth rate in Q4, on a year-over-year basis based on current run rates should be slightly better than Q3 and also factoring in the forecast from IHS that I just went through.","So, if you look at in Q4, North America is down less than it was in Q4 and the Detroit 3 are down less in Q4 than they were in Q3. So, both those businesses should be in line with Q3, maybe a little bit better on a year-over-year basis in Q4.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And the rest of the segments will be pretty much consistent with what we saw in 3Q as well?","Scott Santi","Exactly. As the momentum is solid in the other five, that's what I would say heading into Q4.","Michael Larsen","Yeah, I think what you'll see, Nigel, based on current run rates, most of our businesses will improve their year-over-year organic growth rate in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's helpful. And then just my one follow-on, obviously, the margin trends in aggregates remained very, very strong. Auto margins were slightly weaker year-over-year despite comping the acquisition in 3Q.","Maybe just -- maybe Michael or Scott, just discuss the impact of the mix between D3 being down mid-teens versus Europe, Asia up strong? So maybe just talk about that mix and perhaps whether or not we saw a disproportionate impact from raw materials in Auto as well?","Michael Larsen","Yeah. It's actually not that much of a mix issue, Nigel. If you look at our business and you don't see this, but if you look at the profitability by geography, it's very similar across North America, Europe and China. Really, what you're seeing in the Automotive margins is the price\/cost equation being negative here in the near term.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you and good morning everyone.","Scott Santi","Joe, good morning.","Joe Ritchie","My first question is perhaps just welding margins for a second. I think, the incrementals were, I think, slightly below 30% for the quarter. I know you guys put through some pricing increases as well, so would have just expected that to be a little bit higher.","And Michael, I think in your prepared comments, I think you mentioned some restructuring that was coming through in Europe. So maybe to the extent that you can talk about that restructuring, when we\u2019re going to be through it? And anything else that may have affected the incrementals this quarter?","Michael Larsen","The bulk of it, Joe, I mean, so you're seeing a little bit of steel inflation coming through on the Welding side, and then you saw the 70 basis points of increased restructuring costs year-over-year. I think if you look at the year-to-date performance and for the full year, we expect to be in this 27% range in Q4 and for the full year. So really nothing unusual beyond those two items.","Scott Santi","And the European restructuring is a one-quarter event.","Michael Larsen","Yeah, yeah.","Scott Santi","Q3.","Michael Larsen","So, this is a one-time restructuring event, which will have benefits obviously in Q4 and next year.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Maybe \u2013 and maybe just a little bit more color. What specifically were you guys doing in Europe from a restructuring standpoint?","Scott Santi","Joe, we typically don't discuss the specifics of those projects. ","Michael Larsen","It's related to Enterprise Initiatives. Nothing unusual out of the ordinary.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. All right. Maybe switching then to price\/cost. I know that this quarter, I think you guys did 40 basis points or the 40-basis point drag on margins. I think you guys had expected price\/cost to be a little bit less of a drag in the second half of the year.","And so, I'm just wondering whether that expectation has now changed. And how should we be then thinking about it also for 2018? Is there an opportunity potentially for this to turn into a tailwind to your margins next year?","Scott Santi","So, Joe, on 2018, I think we're going to have to wait until -- when we get together in New York in December. I think, we haven't rolled out the annual plan here yet, so I wouldn't be -- I really don't want to comment on 2018 yet at this point.","I think what we did say on the call last time where the headwind was 50 basis points in Q2, that we expected it to get better from here on out. We just did 40 basis points in Q3. We expect it to be a little bit better than that here in Q4. And so, for the full year, it should be about 40 basis points of headwind.","And I'll just -- to put it in context, I mean, we just took up our margin guidance for the full year. We expect to be at 24% operating margin, and that's after offsetting 40 basis points of price\/cost headwind here in 2017. So, we -- fundamentally, nothing has changed in terms of how we look at the price\/cost equation. Should get a little better in Q4 and then we'll give you an update in December when we get together in New York in terms of what it might look like for 2018.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso with ISI Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Raso","Hi. Thank you. First question, I just want to bridge the gap on the faster organic growth in the fourth quarter than third quarter. You didn't call it out but is it Test & Measurement off of an easier comp? Is that really the notable acceleration in organic fourth quarter versus third? Is the other business still\u2026","Scott Santi","A little better Auto.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. I mean, that's part of it. I think, in Electronics this quarter, like, I think, we said in the script here is, Electronics was up 13% last year and so a tough comp and so they will get a little bit better here in the fourth quarter. But I think as we look at it, based on current run rates, the majority of our segments will have a higher year-over-year growth rate in Q4 than they did in Q3.","David Raso","Okay. And that is a set up a bit for when you made the comment earlier about in progress, I don\u2019t know if you would used the word, significant progress on the organic sales growth for next year. I know it's a little bit harder with sales than with margins in a way, but we used to think of the margin story as 100 bps a year.","This year, the organic sales growth accelerated, if you hit your number, about 120 bps. Just so we can frame the expectations going into the December meeting, when you say significant progress, can you at least give us some idea of -- I mean, people just trying to figure out if the CapEx businesses may be aren't coming back quite as quickly as we like.","In Auto, maybe a slower just given the strong growth to start this year. Where are the businesses that we expect accelerated growth? Is it the business that are doing pretty well now? Or is it some of the laggers like Polymers and Food stepping it up? If you can just kind of help frame the acceleration for next year that you speak to.","Scott Santi","Yeah. I think we\u2019ve got to defer you to December, sorry. Our plans are still coming together. I would expect every one of our seven businesses to be better in 2018 than they were in 2017.","Michael Larsen","Okay. Yeah.","David Raso","So organically every business faster growth rate in 2018?","Scott Santi","Organic and on margins, too.","Michael Larsen","Yes.","Scott Santi","Now what exactly that looks like, we got to get through the annual plan process here and then we'll -- we can talk about it in December.","David Raso","No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Scott Santi","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is now open.","Mig Dobre","Yes. Good morning everyone.","Scott Santi","Hi, Mig.","Mig Dobre","Just maybe to follow-up a bit on David's line of questioning here. I guess I'm wondering, when you're looking at your business this year, obviously, it's done better from an organic growth standpoint. But broadly speaking, growth has been considerably better. I mean, PMI, for instance, is now at the highest level since 2004 and who knows, chances are it's probably not going to accelerate from here as we look at 2018.","So, if you're thinking about accelerating organic growth, how much of it would you say is going to be within your control, things like PLS or new products or things of that nature as opposed to simply end markets being better?","Scott Santi","Well, I'd make two comments. One is that -- one would be just to remind you that PMI was strong in 2014, 2015 and 2016 when overall organic rates in our industry were not particularly strong, so I'm not sure that, that's the best parameter necessarily. But I would say overall is we are all about what's within our control.","So as Michael said, none of our forecast is ever related to anything other than current run rates and what we expect to do incremental beyond that. So, everything that we are committing to, everything that we are working on is all in the realm of the various areas within our control.","So, pivot to organic growth is much more focused on, as we talked about, additional penetration opportunities with our biggest and best customers, a very healthy and productive new product pipeline and some combination thereof across all sets of our businesses.","Mig Dobre","Is it fair to expect lower drag from PLS next year?","Scott Santi","I think it'll -- it's hard to tell. It may be in line with what we're seeing this year, maybe a little bit lower than that. I'll just -- the PLS is a drag on organic growth rate but it is really a very positive thing for what we're trying to do from an 80\/20 standpoint. It really sets up the portfolio for much stronger organic growth on a go-forward basis with best-in-class margins and returns.","So, we haven't talked about it much this year. We \u2013 I mentioned it today because it was a little bit higher, it can be a little bit lumpy as we go through these projects across 85 divisions. And when we rolled it out, we were a little bit higher than the average for this year. But in 2018, we're probably going to enter into more of a maintenance mode. What that number looks like, I don't know right now but it's probably a little bit lower than what we have seen this year. ","Mig Dobre","Okay. Great. Lastly, on Specialty Product, there were some headlines early in the quarter here that the Zip-Pak business had three trademarks canceled. I guess, I'm wondering if there's any comment as to how this might impact either the revenue stream going forward or any impact to margin for the Zip-Pak business. Thanks.","Scott Santi","Yeah, thanks. There's no impact from that.","Mig Dobre","All right. Thank you.","Scott Santi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Scott Santi","Hi, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Just a point of clarification. On the price\/cost versus the enterprise strategic sourcing savings, is the right way to think about that price\/cost being more perhaps steel inflation showing up in the gross margins versus enterprise strategic sourcing savings maybe being more indirect savings like travel, et cetera? Is that the right way to think about it conceptually?","Scott Santi","So, I'd say that the first point of your question was correct that you do see the impact of price\/cost in gross margins. But you also see the impact of the strategic sourcing efforts in the gross margins.","Michael Larsen","At this point, that's where the 80 of the benefit is, right.","Scott Santi","So really on the indirect side is not -- it's really primarily on the direct side. And the only point we're making, Ann, is if we take those -- if we were to report those Strategic Sourcing savings in the price\/cost number as some of our peers are doing, not saying it\u2019s good or bad, I'm just saying the way we report it looks a little bit different than some of our peers, the price\/cost equation would be positive this year and it would have been positive in Q3.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate that. I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it conceptually the right way.","Scott Santi","Yeah. That's fair.","Ann Duignan","Then on the remainder of your businesses, could you just talk, I guess, specifically construction and maybe welding? Was there any impact on your business? I think about the welding business, you can use those welders with backup power units. Any impact on either welding or construction in the back of the storms or anything anticipated going forward?","Scott Santi","Yeah, so Ann, let me just say first, we have more than 300 employees in Houston, 400 in Florida, 20 employees in Puerto Rico, and the most important thing as we talked about the impact of the storms is that they're all safe and we're only a small number of them are personally invited. And all of our facilities, the eight facilities in the region, we didn't have a lot of significant damage and we're back up \u2013 and they were back up and running pretty quickly.","So, in terms of the results here in the near term, there were certainly some puts and takes by business, which is what you're getting at. We did see a little bit of an uptick on the welding side as well as the construction side. And that was offset actually by some Food Equipment orders that were not shipped into the region where the customer elected to defer for now.","So overall, probably neutral for ITW here in terms of the third quarter. I think longer term this will probably be a net positive for some of our businesses, especially on the Construction side. But we've not put anything in the forecast at this point.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I\u2019ll take it offline and get back. Thank you. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. I guess, first question, obviously, you guys have done a phenomenal job on the margin side in terms of Enterprise Initiatives. As we think about the different business segments, are there certain segments where you feel like you that story sort of played out and there's not as much to do within your control and we should think about margins more driven by volumes versus incremental help from the Enterprise Initiatives as we think to 2018?","Michael Larsen","Yeah, thank you, Jamie. And I think we would \u2013 the way we think about it is that despite the considerable progress at the enterprise level and also by segment that we've shown you that data in the past, we believe that there's more room for improvement here. And I think that's a -- we believe that's true for all of our segments and that's based on what they're telling us.","This is not what we here at corporate think. This is based on the roll up from the divisions. And we'll see what 2018 looks like, but we expect at least another 100 basis points of margin expansion just from the Enterprise Initiatives alone. And just as an aside, if you look at \u2013 ","Scott Santi","It's in 2018 over 2017.","Michael Larsen","In 2018 over 2017. And just as an aside, if you look at Q3, every one of the segments had at least 90 basis points of Enterprise Initiative impact. So, it\u2019s broad-based, it's still going on and is having a meaningful impact on our margins. The other point, I'll just make, if you look at \u2013 if you go back to slide 6 on the deck, you can see that our seven segments are all starting to cluster around the mid to high 20s from an operating margin standpoint.","And some of these businesses have improved by more than 10 percentage points since we started the enterprise strategy. And I think that the fact that they're now clustering in the mid-20s really speaks to how powerful, our differentiated business model is. And as we continue to focus on leveraging that, we expect to continue to see improved margins across the portfolio, and therefore also at the enterprise level.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Fisher","Thanks. Good morning.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Steve Fisher","Michael, you mentioned that PLS can be lumpy, but to what extent was that PLS drag in the quarter plan going into the quarter? Or was that an adjustment that you made as the quarter progressed? Just wondering where you felt the need to do more PLS or kind of where you found the opportunity?","Michael Larsen","Yeah, so this was all planned, Steve, at the division level. So, I think I can't really point to any one segment. There's still \u2013the 80\/20 initiatives are broad-based across 85 divisions. And like I said, when you we rolled up the number for the quarter, it was 70 basis points, a little bit higher than what we had expected maybe, but that's actually a good thing, as I tried to say earlier.","Steve Fisher","Okay. And you mentioned some of the puts and takes of the hurricane in September. But more broadly, did you see any particular acceleration or deceleration as the quarter progressed? ","Michael Larsen","No, I think when we looked at the monthlies they were all right in line with run rate and what we had expected. So, nothing unusual from a monthly standpoint.","Steve Fisher","Okay. And then just real quick, the commercial construction looked like it flipped to a minus 3% from positive 3% last quarter. Was that just a comps thing or is there something moderating there?","Michael Larsen","I think that business can be \u2013 commercial construction side can be a little lumpy. I think that market, I would probably say, is flat to maybe slightly negative, maybe slowing a little bit on the commercial construction side, but more than offset by the 7% growth that you saw in residential. And just if you look at commercial construction business on a year-to-date basis, it's flat, which is probably in line with where we see the market right now.","Steve Fisher","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Michael Larsen","Good morning.","Nathan Jones","Just a question on corporate expense. You guys have had fairly low corporate expense this year, even adjusting out the legal sentiment. Can you talk about what we should expect for our quarterly run rate, say in the fourth quarter and going into 2018?","Scott Santi","So, if you look at, Nathan, so there's a line in the income statement in the schedule on the back where we typically, on a quarterly basis, have $20 million of unallocated cost. That has flipped positive with the legal settlement. I would expect for next year that our corporate cost will be flat on a year-over-year basis.","And so, as a result of that, you'll see \u2013 we will come back to that $20 million of unallocated cost in the income statement as we go through next year on a quarterly basis. So, don't expect any big changes from a corporate cost standpoint.","Nathan Jones","Okay, so about $80 million next year. Then just one question on the international Welding business. You said that was mostly dragged down by the oil and gas market. Is it possible for you to give us any information on how the international Welding business did ex the oil and gas market?","Scott Santi","It's really the majority of what we're showing there is oil and gas, so international was down. I think oil and gas international was down 11%, which is in line with the overall number for the international side.","Michael Larsen","The vast majority of our international sales, so I don't think we have much in terms of read-through.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much. ","Scott Santi","Right.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi. Good morning.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Joe O'Dea","Looks like another quarter of good growth out of China. And I think actually looked like some acceleration from 2Q, given a harder comp. We see the data on the Auto side, but just if you could talk about China a little bit more broadly, maybe where you're seeing some sources of acceleration there and kind of confidence that you have in those demand levels as we move forward.","Scott Santi","Yes. I think, Joe, if you remember last year, the Auto business in China was up 40% year-over-year, so that was \u2013 so this was a tough comp, and despite that, the business was up 10%, the Automotive business in China. When we look at China, it's \u2013 the strength is really broad-based.","So, Test & Measurement, Food, Polymers & Fluids, Welding all positive, Specialty Products all positive here in the third quarter, up 13%. And on a year-to-date basis, the same is true and our businesses in China are up 15% on a year-to-date basis.","Joe O'Dea","That's really helpful. And then, I guess, just along that, no signs of something within the quarter that would have been a particular boost? That's more kind of stable demand that you see that's supporting that growth?","Scott Santi","Yeah, no, I think across the board really stable overall, like I said, China up 13%.","Joe O'Dea","Great. And then just on price\/cost, when you talk about the split between the dollars and the margin, when you think about the typical lag, if you can kind of characterize it in any sort of typical fashion, what do you generally see as the lag time before we'd start to see margin come back so that you're at least net neutral on price\/cost?","Scott Santi","Yeah, it's about two quarters until we've offset any -- the material cost side with price, about two quarters historically so.","Joe O'Dea","Perfect.

You may begin.","John Brooklier","Thanks, Diane. Good morning, everyone and welcome to ITW\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me this morning is our CEO Scott Santi and our CFO, Michael Larsen. We would also like to welcome our Erin Hoffman our new VP of Investor Relations. As you know, Erin joined us in early September and we are working on a smooth transition of the Investor Relations role till I retire in March of 2015. Erin good to have you onboard.","During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our outstanding Q3 financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. As usual, we will open the call to your questions. We ask for your cooperation on our one question, one follow up question policy as we have scheduled one hour for today\u2019s call. Before we get to the quarterly data, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2014 fourth quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking questions identified on this slide. For a preview of the company\u2019s 2014 Form 10-Q for the second quarter for more details about the important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectation. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","Take care of that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott Santi, who will comment on the quarter. Scott?","Scott Santi","Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Overall, we were pleased with the performance in the quarter and with the progress that we are continuing to make in executing our strategy. Operating margins in the quarter were a record 20.9% and were 190 basis points higher than in Q3 of last year, with a 120 basis points of that improvement coming directly from enterprise strategy initiatives. After-tax return on invested capital was 20.1%, marking the first time we\u2019ve gotten both of these key metrics above our stated goals of 20% plus in the quarter since the launch of our enterprise strategy in 2012. Operating income of 772 million was the highest quarterly total on the company\u2019s history and free cash flow was very strong at 128% of that income. EPS of $1.28 was up 42% versus the prior year. We were also pleased with our organic growth performance in the quarter as we had four of our seven business segments deliver organic growth of 5% or better. While we are still three or four quarters away from being able to turn the majority of our attention to the growth agenda component of our strategy, it\u2019s encouraging to see some early signs of progress on the organic growth front in a number of our businesses.","Product line and customer simplification activities remain an active element of our portfolio management initiative currently, and had a negative impact on the company\u2019s overall organic growth rate of approximately 1 percentage point in the quarter. I expect that these activities will have a similar 1% negative impact on our organic growth rates were up most, if not all, by 2015. However, keep in mind the product line in customer simplification our core components of ITW\u2019s 80-20 business management system and we are in the process of reapplying it to our scale of operating divisions. These activities are a key driver of our ability to continue to improve margins and returns and to accelerate organic growth going forward. Overall, we are pleased with our progress as we approach the end of year two of our five year enterprise strategy. At our upcoming Investor Day in December, we will provide investors with an updated view of our performance targets for 2017, as well as lay out a preliminary line of what we think 2018 and beyond might look like in terms of both strategy and performance.","I\u2019d like to close by thanking all of our people around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. Now I\u2019d like to turn over to Michael. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Okay let\u2019s get started with the financial summary on page two. Third quarter was another quarter with solid execution and high quality of earnings with organic growth of 3.5%, record operating income and record operating margins of 20.9%. EPS of a $1.28 was an increase of 42% versus prior year. Revenues were 3.7 billion, up 3.5% with growth in all major geographies. Four segments automotive, food equipment, test and measurement and electronics and welding stood out with organic growth of 5% or better.","As Scott mentioned, consistent with the first half of the year, product line simplification was a 1% drag on our overall organic growth rate. Five of our seven segments expanded margins by more than 200 basis points, with a 120 basis points from enterprise initiatives, which included increased contribution from our strategic sourcing efforts. Incremental margins were 76% and cash generation was solid with free operating cash flow 128%. We spent 500 million on share repurchases and you might recall that we raised a dividend of 15% in the third quarter. Good progress in after-tax return on invested capital with an improvement of 250 basis points. So overall, we were pleased with the strong results in the quarter and the continued positive momentum on our enterprise initiatives.","On page three, a few highlights on organic growth for the quarter with North America up 4% as a result of continued strength in automotive up 8%, food equipment up 6%. Also in North America, welding was up 10% and test and measurement and electronics grew 6%, certainly some encouraging progress on organic growth. International growth was also positive up 3% in the quarter with Europe up 3%. Four of our segments were positive in Europe, with automotive up 9% and food equipment up 6%. Asia-Pacific increased 5% driven by Australia up 5% and China up 3%. Automotive OEM and food equipment in China were both up double digits construction in Australia test and measurement and electronics in Asia-Pacific were up high single digits. So in summary, solid organic growth across all major geographies and some encouraging signs in our CapEx driven segments welding and test and measurement, as we continue to apply our 80-20 business system and position our businesses for future organic growth.","Moving on to slide four, operating margins were once again a highlight as solid execution on the enterprise initiatives which included greater contributions from the strategic sourcing effort, led to record operating margins of 20.9%, an increase of 190 basis points from last year. As Scott mentioned, the third quarter was the highest ever in terms of operating income at 772 million, which speaks to the quality of the revenues generated by this portfolio of highly differentiated businesses after completing the portfolio management component of our enterprise strategy. This former record was 770 million in the second quarter of 2012, the quarter that had revenues almost 1 billion higher than this quarter. We were pleased to see that all seven segments improved operating margins with five of the seven segments expanding margins by more than 200 basis points, and polymers and fluids exceeding 20% for the first time. At the right side of the page we\u2019ve listed the drivers of the margin expansion, with the largest contribution being 120 basis points from enterprise initiatives.","We continue to invest in future margin expansion and spent $28 million on restructuring related to our business structure simplification efforts. So clearly more to come in terms of BSS savings, as we spend approximately $100 million this year. Operating leverage was 80 basis points and price cost was favorable for a total of 190 basis points of margin expansion. So really great progress and lots of positive momentum on the enterprise initiatives. We\u2019ve continued spend on restructuring and higher contributions from sourcing which gives us increased confidence in our ability to expand margins in 2015 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes to go over our updated guidance, but first let me turn it over to John for some additional commentary on the segment.","John Brooklier","Thank you Michael. Moving to slide five, you\u2019ll see the breakdown of total revenue and operating income per segment. Six out of our seven segments produced top-line growth in the quarter, while all seven segments demonstrated operating margin expansion. Our auto OEM, food equipment, test and measurement electronics and welding segments led the company\u2019s top line growth and five out of seven segments produced operating margin over 20%. This was an outstanding quarter for the company as our enterprise initiatives contributed to improve our operating margin performance in all of our segments which I will detail now. As I cover our segments, I\u2019ll remind all of you that our organic revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisition activity.","Moving to auto OEM, the segment produced another long line of solid quarters. Organic revenue grew 8% compared to worldwide auto builds of 2% and that was due to ITW\u2019s style customer backed innovation and ongoing product penetration. By geography, organic revenue for Europe grew 9% North America increased 8% and China was up 12%. Our European businesses outperformed European auto builds by 10 percentage points due to penetration gains across all platforms. In North America our growth equaled auto builds at 8% however, Detroit where we have significant penetration only grew by 3%. In China, we outperformed auto builds by four percentage points. Profitability remain high with operating margins 23.4% a 230 basis points improvement from last year.","Moving to slide six, in our test and measurement electronic segment organic revenues increased 5% in Q3, a solid improvement sequentially over last quarter. Test and measurements organic revenues grew 8% led by strength in our worldwide Instron business with growth of 22% in Q3, and both North America, Asia produced good results. The electronics business increased organic revenues by 3% as the electronic assembly business moved into positive territory with 5% growth in Q3. The remainder of the electronics business grew 1%. For the total segment, Q3 operating margin showed notable improvement at 18.7% that\u2019s 240 basis points higher than the year ago period. The food equipment segments organic growth rate of 5% reflected another quarter of very good growth and showed progress along all major product categories and geographies. In North America, equipment and service related organic related service revenues grew 6% and 4% respectively, thanks to growth in refrigeration and cooking businesses and new product innovation. Internationally equipment revenues increased 8% due to strong warewash and refrigeration sales, while service organic revenues increased 1%. The segment\u2019s operating margin at 23.1% was a robust 320 basis points higher than the prior year period. So again, good progress on the food equipment side.","Moving to slide seven, in our polymers and fluids segment organic revenues declined 2% and that\u2019s largely driven by our ongoing product line simplification activity. As we\u2019ve noted in prior quarters, we continue to weed out less profitable products and customers in this segment, which as you know, negatively affect organic revenue but substantially improves profitability. Polymers and fluids and hygiene businesses organic revenues each declined 1%, while automotive aftermarket declined 4%. As the product line simplification activity diminishes, we expect the effects of PLS to have less of an impact on organic revenue in 2015 and beyond. The much better new shorter term is that the segment achieved Q3 operating margin of 20.2%, a 210 basis point improvement over the year ago period.","Looking at the welding segment, the worldwide organic revenues grew 5% due to strength in North American equipment sales. North American organic revenues increased 10%, it\u2019s a very good number for them, in the quarter and that was driven by robust growth in both industrial and commercial markets and growth in the oil and gas business. International organic revenue declined 7% due to impact of delayed onshore pipeline projects in China and the Middle East, and also some of the PLS projects in Germany negatively impacted the organic revenue growth in the quarter. All said, the welding segment continues to lead the way with company high operating margins of 26.2% and that\u2019s 80 basis points higher than the year ago period. So a nice quarter from the welding segment.","Moving to slide eight the construction product segment produced modest organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter. Asia-Pacific led the way with 6% organic growth and that was largely driven by growth across all construction sectors in the Australian and New Zealand geographies. In North America, organic revenue was up 2% with a residential and renovation categories up, but commercial construction down. In Europe, organic revenue was down 1% and that was largely due to product simplification and declines of France, offset by strength in the United Kingdom. As noted in the prior quarter the segment\u2019s profitability continues to be our major focus and operating margins of 18.9% were 270 basis points higher than the year ago period. In specialty product segments, organic revenues were flat as modest growth across our consumer packaging business was offset by delays and customer projects and warehouse automation business. In total, our consumer packaging business and appliance was flat while ground support was up 2%. This segment represents a collection of high margin businesses in the total segment operating margins of 21.3%, the 20 basis point higher than the year ago period.","So substantially good progress from a lot of our segments. Now let me turn the call over to Michael who will cover our fourth quarter and 2014 full year guidance. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Okay, thanks, John. So on page nine let\u2019s start with our guidance for the quarter where we expect 2% to 3% organic revenue growth and 100 basis points of margin expansion from enterprise initiatives. Currency is a 3% headwind on revenues, so total revenues are expected to be about flat. Foreign exchange is a manageable $0.04 headwind to EPS and EPS is expected to be in the $1.07 to $1.15 range midpoint of $1.11, an increase of 21% over last year. For the full year, we are raising our EPS guidance third time this year to $4.57 to $4.65 which compares to $4.50 to $4.62 previously. At the new midpoint of $4.61, EPS is expected to be up 27% over 2013. Our organic revenue growth assumptions for the year remains unchanged at 2% to 3% and we now expect higher operating margins of approximately 20%, roughly 200 basis points of improvement.","So in summary, we are pleased with our progress on our enterprise strategy and strong financial results for the quarter and for the year. In a macro environment similar to the one that we\u2019re in today, we have great confidence in our ability to further expand operating margins and deliver differentiated earnings growth in 2015 and beyond as the team continues to execute well in our five year strategy and position ITW for a solid organic growth, with best in class modules in returns. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th.","So with that, let me turn it back over to John. John Brooklier","Thanks, Michael. So now I\u2019ll open the call for your questions so please be brief to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question. Remember one question and one follow up question. We\u2019ll now open the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Rob Wertheimer, your line is now open.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Hi. Good morning. So, great results in welding. I was curious if there was what the discrepancy if there is one between welding and construction particularly North America is? Does the strength in welding tend to turn around the construction or you\u2019re turning product lines somewhere there or it\u2019s just not as much overlapping them in the customers I would have guessed?","Michael Larsen","I might probably not as much overlap most of the strength in welding was in what I described is more general industrial and oil and gas really end markets, less so in commercial construction.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Perfect. And then just one more in welding may be you don\u2019t want to get in too much detail in the international side, but are you able to say if the pipeline delays are sort of geopolitically related or whether there is any other more economic reason to the delay?","Michael Larsen","I\u2019d say it\u2019s hard to say at this point. I think we\u2019re looking at some things that just got pushed back a little bit relative to our earlier expectations on timing. I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So far you don\u2019t think it\u2019s cancelled or gone, it\u2019s just pushed out?","Michael Larsen","Yes.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Great. I think that was my two I guess. Thank you.","Michael Larsen","Thanks Rob.","Operator","Ann Duignan, your line is now open.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, good morning.","Scott Santi","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Can you talk a little bit about what you are weeding out on the businesses that you are weeding out, the lagging businesses. Can you just talk about \u2013 give a little bit more color on which business you are actually divesting up or discontinuing?","Scott Santi","Well if you\u2019re referring to the product line simplification work the way I would describe it as sort of the next level down of our portfolio strategy and really what we\u2019re doing there is weeding out relatively small volume product lines that add complexity, but don\u2019t really drive a lot of impact and\/or product lines where we don\u2019t have the sort of level of differentiation that we\u2019re ultimately looking to build the company around. So lower profit, certainly lower volume product lines. And that\u2019s going on all over the business. So even automotive that\u2019s got the best growth rate it\u2019s got pretty healthy product line simplification agenda underway.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. So it\u2019s more just 80-20 across the entire business, it\u2019s not related to one specific end market?","Scott Santi","Correct. Well said.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","That\u2019s helpful to understand. And then my follow up is on food equipment, can you just give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on those businesses? And there were some pretty end results just curious to get a bit more color how much is market? How much is market penetration, innovation? If you can just give us a little bit more quantitative analysis around what\u2019s going on there that would be great. Thanks.","Scott Santi","Yeah I think what I would say of I think we\u2019re very happy with the equipment sales increases in the quarter. The one in Europe certainly stands out from my standpoint where we\u2019re plus 8% internationally overall, part of that is certainly some progress we\u2019re making around in acquisition because last year on China, but also the core European business was actually relatively healthy given a lot of the gloom and doom in terms of the overall economic situation there. I would say overall, we\u2019re not seeing a ton of market lifts, probably things in North America will get better but largely these numbers are driven by new product activity.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Any products in particular or any categories in particular, particularly in Europe I\u2019m just curious","Scott Santi","Yeah warewash which is our commercial dishwashing business and also refrigeration in Europe.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And you believe those are more market penetration not end market?","Scott Santi","Yes.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Take care.","Operator","Andrew Kaplowitz. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys good morning. It\u2019s Alan Fleming for Andrew this morning.","Michael Larsen","Alan, how are you?","Unidentified Analyst","I\u2019m doing well. Just on Europe, you saw some acceleration to plus 3% from I think, plus 1 last quarter. And I know some of this seems to be somewhat specific to ITW with strength in food equipment and auto, but just curious if you guys view is it possible that Europe may be a little more stable than some feared and things have not slowed down as much as it seems may be if you just give a little bit more color on that market.","Scott Santi","Yeah sure. Again, we can comment on what we\u2019re seeing in our businesses and we had obviously a good quarter in Europe and a good September when we haven\u2019t seen signs of slowdown in Europe. I mean we were encouraged to see automotive up 9% really continue to build on strong penetration gains in that business. Test and measurement and electronics had a good year all around and were up in Europe. We just talked about food equipment up 6% and then welding, polymers and fluids and construction you\u2019re probably seeing a little bit more product line certification in those businesses but overall Europe for us 3% we\u2019re pleased and we have not seen a slowdown in Europe.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, helpful. And then just on construction North America I know you\u2019re continuing to see some declines on the non-res side is there any kind of reason for hope that you guys are seeing any positive signs in that market?","Scott Santi","The way we characterize our construction business North America it\u2019s been bouncing around quarter to quarter it\u2019s up a little down a little and I think we\u2019re still waiting for some traction overall. There is a fair amount of good progress we\u2019re making inside the business on the margin front, but from an overall demand standpoint I think we\u2019re still not seeing any consistent trends whether it\u2019s commercial construction activity.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. All right. Thank you guys.","Operator","Jamie Cook. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions one broader and then one on test and measurement. I guess I\u2019m surprised I mean know you\u2019re having the market healthy something internal issues help your top line, but I\u2019m surprised when I think about the organic growth of 3.5% just given a number of free announcements that we\u2019ve seen across industrials and just broader concerns on the macro. Did any of your businesses see deterioration as we exited the quarter or as we look into October? And to the headlines you\u2019ve read from other companies concern you more as you think about 2015? And then my second question on the positive test and measurement had a very good quarter. Your Instron business was up 22% I\u2019m just wondering if you can give a color there I think last quarter you talked about some confidence may be you could see a pickup in CapEx your thoughts there. Thanks.","Scott Santi","Yes. So, on your first question Jamie we didn\u2019t see any of our businesses slow down as we went through the quarter. We are \u2013 if you look at the comps on a year over year basis had that made drive some of would be referring to but generally there was solid strength as we went through the quarter there. Although it\u2019s little early to comment but we haven\u2019t seen anything unusual that\u2019s inconsistent with what we were expecting and what\u2019s including in our guidance today. Now that said, I mean we are obviously we are aware of the headlines and what other companies are reporting so we continue to monitor what\u2019s going inside our businesses and the order rates that we\u2019re seeing. In terms of tests and measurements, they had a good year really if you go back to first quarter second quarter backlog activity particularly in the Instron business has been excellent. And we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing now keep in mind that, that business was up 8% organically in the fourth quarter last year so the comps are going to be a little bit more challenging here in the fourth quarter. But in terms of seeing a sustained pick up in CapEx cycle, probably a little too soon to call that but we say that we\u2019re encouraged but what we saw in the second quarter in test and measurement then obviously we\u2019re not seeing anything that would suggest that there is a slowdown in those businesses.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Walter Liptak. Your line is now open.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Hi, thanks. Wanted to go back to the welding segment and I understand your answer that general industry is where you\u2019ve seen the pickup and North America. But I wonder if we saw a slowdown in welding this year and now it seems to be picking up I\u2019m wondering if you can attribute that to anything pent up demand , or any different sectors within welding.","John Brooklier","Well I\u2019ll just go back to what I said earlier which is oil and gas North America in the quarter was strong and also the general industrial part of our business and also the commercial part was certainly much stronger year on year than we\u2019ve seen past prior quarters. But I\u2019ll also reference to what Michael just talked about the pickups are largely for us and the equipment area and from the CapEx standpoint I think it\u2019s been a couple of quarters now improving demand rates in the CapEx area but I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re ready to call any big inflexion point we\u2019d like to see it sustain itself around the couple of quarters.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Does it seem like a pickup in the welding distribution channel or is it direct to\u2026","John Brooklier","The commercial business is what we talk about general industrial and commercial we\u2019re talking about sort of about more fragmented part of the market most of that has access through distribution channel. I assume that the pickup in the channel the sales through the channel are function of increased demand from their end customers.","Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Yeah, of course. Thank you.","Operator","Ajay. You line is open.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Thank you and good morning. Scott, congratulations good to see the organic growth rates come through here. So may be talk a little bit about some of work that\u2019s being done, I imagined a lot of it is blocking and packing business by business but then to the extent there are initiatives at the corporate level, be it in terms of what you\u2019re doing with incentive structures and may be other initiatives. So just give us a sense of what to expect and the work that you\u2019re doing to drive organic growth?","Scott Santi","Yeah sure. So we are as I said in my comments we are still another three or four quarters away from being able to bring the majority of our focus to the organic growth component of this strategy. We\u2019ve talked I think to significant degree about the past in the end what makes all of this work is the ability to move our organic growth rate up and on an historical basis we\u2019re talking percentage point or so improvement relative to the history. So we\u2019re not talking about it a huge step up but a meaningful one. Right now what we\u2019re doing is trying to manage these internal initiatives related to our structure related to sourcing in a thoughtful way to face the implementations of those in such a way that our business is continued to be able to deliver for their customers and deliver for our investors.","We probably got another three to four quarters of pretty significant activity in that regard. So from an organic growth standpoint I think largely what we\u2019ve accomplished to date is I think we\u2019ve got the management team fully aligned around the fact that in this reshaped portfolio we have highly differentiated business that all have significant potential to drive organic growth through innovation and penetration I think that part is very clear across our management team. heading into \u201815 we will be doing some work on incentives to get that sort of further flushed out so in \u201815 and beyond we will continue we\u2019ve already made some adjustments we\u2019ll continue to make some more. But I think this is largely an issue for us of focus and execution with a much higher quality of portfolio that will ultimately add more potential to grow organically.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Good. And then enterprise initiatives obviously very, very impressive margin gains here. And without taking any of that thunder away from the December meeting, may be just talk about which innings you are in terms of savings from BSS and then sourcing?","Scott Santi","Well I think the way that I would answer that Ajay is that we\u2019re in the end of year two of five year plan that we\u2019ve set along that we\u2019re expecting fairly comparable improvements year by year as we go through the plan. I think a couple of years in we have some better sort of thoughts and visibility on where we think we\u2019re going to end up on \u201817 and build the December meeting around sharing some views on that with our investors.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Andy Casey. Your line is open.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Good morning, Andy.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","If we could go back to the enterprise initiative for that last question you\u2019ve increased your 2014 operating margin guidance by about 100 basis points through the year now 20 versus your initial 19 and you\u2019re kind of at the bottom range the longer term 2017 goals. If you\u2019re focusing on returns of the next three to four quarters before you really transition to the organic growth, are we talking about more than 200 basis points left in your view?","Michael Larsen","Yeah so I guess. Andy this is Michael. So we\u2019re not ready to go down that path for a number of reasons. One, we\u2019d like to give you the full picture when we get to our Analyst Day on December 5th that you\u2019re of course invited to. The other thing I tell you is this is annual plan season for us right now so all the businesses are working through their plans for next year being able to share a much better view of what this might look like in terms of the landing spot for margins and returns at the end of the five year enterprise strategy as well as provide some detail on 2015. But what I would echo with Scott just said that we expect all our businesses to continue to improve and get a little bit better on every year on operating margins and you should expect us to describe that in more detail when we get to the analyst day on December 5th.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks. At least the question was good for some laughter in the background.","Scott Santi","Thank you for that.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","You\u2019re welcome. Regarding to the Q4 organic growth guidance for growth moderation just to clarify that Michael, is that mainly driven by comparisons and not trend deterioration?","Michael Larsen","Yes that\u2019s correct. And if you look at the growth rates last year, we were up 3% organically in the fourth quarter we were up 1% up organically in the third quarter. We talked about test and measurement in particular having a more challenging comp and then may be a little bit of a decline auto builds as well. So that\u2019s all factored into our guidance. And like I said we haven\u2019t seen any deterioration in terms of our segments.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you very much.","Operator","John Inch. Your line is now open.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, [inaudible] what was the POS drag in that segment. I forget what you said if you\u2019d actually called that out on the top line.","Michael Larsen","About 2 percentage points in that business, so a little bit more than some of the other segments.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And Michael you or Scott said that you expected the associated drag to lessen in that 2015. When you think overall, you think POS is going to drag the company is organic, the kind of 1% cadence through 2015 or do you expect the other segments to realize the lessening as well?","Michael Larsen","I think a conservative expectation would be a 1% drag all of next year and then largely we will get it behind us. We may get out of it, a quarter or two ahead of that but I think that would be the planning assumption for now.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I assume there is a sort of a degree Scott of kind of flex in that as far as naturally it lessens but then you kind of want to keep it at the 1% to sort of accomplish the initiatives, is that the way to think about it? In other words, it might naturally lessen but then you might redouble efforts to bring it back to 1%?","Scott Santi","No, I think most of its really I would describe as in terms of impact at this magnitude I would describe it as a onetime event. This is really about reshaping the portfolio. So we did it at the macro level in terms of the divestitures and refocusing the company. What\u2019s going on now is really about driving that same principle down to operating businesses. So it\u2019s existing product lines that don\u2019t carry the level of differentiation that we think are appropriate for a strategy or exiting volume product lines in the scale of divisions. So this is much more of a onetime even over a six or eight quarter period of thoughtful, repositioning and refocusing of our portfolio. We need to go through it.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Now that makes sense. Just also the kind of [inaudible] is, in theory you would say POS adds beyond 15 and we get a one point boost, but shouldn\u2019t you in theory get more than one point because less distractions spread over, less robust product lines with the terminology.","Scott Santi","I won\u2019t necessarily applied on a percentage basis, but major component of PLS is to get us focused on the stuff that we really have conviction about, being able to grow at the kind of earnings and returns profile we think are appropriate for the company long term. So there is an element of this that\u2019s certainly margin and return related but it\u2019s equally important from the standpoint of the organic growth accelerations we go forward in getting us focused on the major product lines where we have major positions and industries that really think are the right ones for the company.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And then Scott, one of the phenomena have been in the quarter just the significant down shipped in the price of barrel of oil. Presumably you\u2019ve looked at this possibly touched a little bit. If oil stays around the $80 $85 mark what do you think the impact ITW really if anything?","Scott Santi","I actually can\u2019t answer that. We haven\u2019t spent a lot of time studying that one at this point. If it stays down there for another quarter we will certainly have a more up to date view, a thoughtful view, but right now I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s moving around but not really driving much change in our business underground right now.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So if there is a more significant direct impact I presume you would have been studying it by now, without the characterization?","Scott Santi","Yes.","Operator","[inaudible] Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome Erin. My first question is, thinking about the enterprise initiatives and the 100 basis points in benefits that you\u2019re expecting to see in the out years. I mean is it fair to say that you\u2019re going to see disproportionate amount from the segments today that are below the 20% threshold because as we exit \u201814, you\u2019re probably going to see at least four of your segments above the 20% range. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about it.","Scott Santi","Like I said, we expect all of our businesses to continue to improve every year and just add to that, that some businesses are little further along than may be others. So if you look at the welding business which was in the enterprise initiatives may be a little bit more for the long run and the enterprise strategy and the ability to now focus on organic growth versus some of the initiatives. But overall, I think we\u2019ve said before that we expect all of our businesses to reach 20% plus over time and like I said, we expect all of our business to continue to improve every quarter, every year.","Unidentified Analyst","And I guess may be one follow on is really you guys are nice to have a breaking out where you\u2019re spending your restructuring spending. It looks in the most recent quarters in an auto or food equipment. There has been recently some concerns that the auto market are going to decelerate as we head into next year and clearly that\u2019s been a driver for you guys. So just any commentary around where you\u2019re spending on restructuring and any view on the auto markets would be helpful?","Scott Santi","The restructuring basically follows our BSS initiatives which you know particular event based on end market conditions and in terms of we\u2019ve deploying that spending over the last couple of years. From an auto perspective I think we are certainly in a position to absorb some modest slowdown in the end market. We have in terms of the penetration games that we have been delivering for the last 8 to 12 quarters now, one target for business where we have three years of essentially visibility in terms of new programs that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ve got a pretty good pipeline of new content coming in and certainly tailwind is better than headwind. But can be still operated and generate some organic growth even if the market slows down or flattens out on our site, I think we are in a really good position to do that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Eli Lustgarten. Your line is now open.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research","Good morning, everyone.","Scott Santi","Hey, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research","Can we just follow up your last comment and talk about the automotive. You said three years visibility I mean the gains in your from penetration was absolutely spectacular. Can you give us an idea of what kind of thing that we can expect over the next four to six quarters because you said you had to see for 12. Would it stay at the same rate or can you give us some magnitude, some way of calibrating penetration games that we\u2019ll see for the next","Michael Larsen","I think we\u2019ve been running at four to five percentage points over market growth kind of rate and I think good expectation would be for us to be able to continue that.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research","So sustainable at least well till \u201815?","Michael Larsen","We believe so.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research","And second point sourcing and better buying a big part and this year everybody\u2019s been blessed with flow of material prices going on. Is there any way if you can give us some idea of the benefit of the actual drop in commodity prices have especially company versus the initiatives we\u2019ll get some idea how we\u2019re leveraging that at all?","Michael Larsen","The way we reported externally is we\u2019ll give you the price cost metric and that has been favorable all year, every quarter by 10 basis points, twice ahead of cost. So that continues\u2026I think at this point we still describe the material environment fairly benign. There is a couple of outliers for the overall. I think all businesses are doing a good job offsetting material price inflation with price. On the sourcing side, is the bigger contribution to the over 120 basis points of margin expansion. While we don\u2019t break it out between sourcing, what I\u2019ll tell you is that we were very encouraged by the progress that we\u2019re seeing on the strategic sourcing side and you see in our variable margins or gross margins with 100 basis points improvement that we believe is sustainable. So I think we\u2019d answer your question.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research","And the bulk of it is coming from the sourcing side at this point, would you guess?","Michael Larsen","So we don\u2019t break out the 120, so we don\u2019t break it out, but like I said we are very encouraged by the positive momentum on the sourcing side and we expect that to continue.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research","Thank you very much","Operator","Joel Tiss. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","I didn\u2019t I was going to make it. Thanks. How\u2019s it going? As you guys move through this the 80-20 and the simplification and other things that you are working on, can you just give us a sense of how, I know you are not looking at the acquisition yet, can you talk a little bit about how you are seeing opportunities in that front to fill in different product lines and may be how the philosophy in the future around acquisition would end up changing instead of buying [inaudible]","Scott Santi","I think we would plan to spend some time on that in December if we can defer that answer that question of Joel in December. I think as Michael said before we\u2019d like to be able to talk about that with all of you on our investors in a way that\u2019s more comprehensive than a quick answer.","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","So it\u2019s not too early like that was the other part of the question, it\u2019s not too early for you guys to start thinking of acquisition? There is a lot of stuff on your plate obviously but.","Scott Santi","Well I think it\u2019s a matter of where do acquisitions fit in our strategy I think that\u2019s ultimately what we want to talk about and certainly it\u2019s not a matter of where we\u2019re \u2013 from a financial standpoint or it\u2019s not a matter of capability, we know how to acquire companies and ultimately where they fit in our strategy, on a go forward basis is a very different place than where they fit historically in ITW.","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And then lastly if there\u2019s no to look at the $500 million of share repurchase in the fourth quarter as a sign that things are slowing down a little bit or if there is any concern in the operations?","Michael Larsen","No, I don\u2019t you think how you would draw that conclusion, I mean we said that we were going to be opportunistic in terms of share repurchases in the second half of the year. We started out the third quarter with 500 million and in the fourth quarter we expect to spend at least another 500 million on the share repurchases. So there is no change in terms of our view of how attractive the share repurchases are and therefore we are continuing obviously.","Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thanks very much.","Operator","Stanley Elliot. Your line is still open.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you guys for putting me in Hate to go back to the welding business because there are so many things to talk about in the quarter but as it relates to the oil piece, could you quantify how big the oil end market is for welding in general?","Scott Santi","20% of our North American business.","Unidentified Analyst","It\u2019s fair to say when you talk about the general environment a lot of the growth you are seeing was more industrial production kind of a general fab which is a significantly larger part of the market if I am not mistaken. Is that correct?","Scott Santi","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Steve Fisher. Your line is still open.","Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS","Thanks. Good morning, I may have missed this earlier but can you discuss the direction of various components of your business in China how they are moving in different directions or where they\u2019re all up. Basically, we saw the automotive business leaped away up 12%, food equipment also up double digits so we said a lot about the acquisition that we did and how good a job the team has done in terms of integrating that acquisition. So now we are benefiting organic growth rates in food equipment in China of solid double digits. Polymers and fluids had a good quarter, up 5% and then the others are fairly small. The main drag really was what\u2019s got talked about oil and gas pipeline projects been differed in China so that business was down but other than that \u2013 which was on the wielding side. Other than that we had a very good quarter again in China.","Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Sean Wayne. Your line is still open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi good morning. I would want to maybe come back to the food equipment again I mean the incremental margins in that business significant acceleration there. I mean certainly you talked about new products, can you just help me understand how much of the margin expansion was kind of volume related versus new product introductions? And then should we start thinking about this business being kind of a 20% to 25% margin business kind of going forward or was there anything of one timish in that quarter that is unlikely to repeat.","Michael Larsen","No, I mean there was nothing unusual in the quarter other than really solid execution and organic grows. To answer your question specifically, if you look at the 270 bases points of margin expansion in food equipment in the quarter, 150 of that came from the initiatives. So the work around at BSS and sourcing and a 120 bases point from the operating leverage on the organic growth. But really I guess Scott described it very well in terms of performance of that business and we think it\u2019s very sustainable on the go forward basis.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thank you. Just know housekeeping the other income came in I guess quite a bit harder than what I would have expected in giving the run like the last couple of quarters. It means talking of what the variance was there?","Michael Larsen","It\u2019s primarily interest income.","Unidentified Analyst","Ok perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Jim Krapfel. Your line is still open.","Jim Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","Hi good morning. So just on price costs I imagine while your raw material cost have come down recently. I would like to get your comments on the extent of that going forward and then also your ability to hold and increase pricing from here.","Michael Larsen","I would expect us to continue to be favorable on the price cost side of things and so saw 10 bases points in this quarter and it\u2019s probably going to be in that range for the fourth quarter but you know as these businesses know are working to become more and more differentiated and in terms of adding value to the customers you obviously going to have more leverage for a pricing standpoint so but I wouldn\u2019t expect that just yet but nothings really change in terms of ability to continue to get price in all of our businesses to offset the cost.","Jim Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. John Inch. Your line is open.","John Inch \u2013 Bank of America","Hi so in terms of follow up come more of a big picture question Scott ITW historically has never been managed on a geographic basis now that you\u2019ve been CEO clearly enterprise initiative have a lot of traction and momentum. The company has made a lot of structural changes, are you thinking perhaps any more about sort of managing the company as a bit portfolio in so far as having geographic exposures are concerned. I will give you an example so China you know you have done pretty well, but there seems to be significant sort of, there is an expectation China could slow in the coming years. So I don\u2019t know how that could represent your businesses as may be a pro or con but you know how does it affect kind of corporate in the way you are looking at the world. That\u2019s just one example, there could be lots of others.","Scott Santi","I think where we are and we\u2019ve done a lot of thinking about this really the most important decision that we make for the company and our shareholders of what we business we should be in. And geography is in our view kind of second condition to sort of our thinking around what business we should be in. If you look across the portfolio that we\u2019ve assembled we\u2019ve got $2 billion plus businesses highly differentiated in terms of the things they do for their customers. $2 billion business customers. Lots of room to move.","Operator","David Raso. Your line is open.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Research","Good morning. Just a quick question, thinking about incremental margins next year, I know pensions been a help this year I meant that\u2019s been really more just an absence of some of the curtailments you had last year. Let me just try to think the puts and takes for next year, I know you\u2019re not going to want us to give us too much granularity, but there any items which we talked about enterprise initiatives, pension anything else that we can think about last quarters obviously incremental have been over 75%. So the baseline for next year but just trying to get a feel for the puts and takes.","Michael Larsen","I think the way I\u2019d answer your question David is that look at ITW historically excluding initiatives have been in the 30% 35% range. And when we\u2019re done with the initiatives, we\u2019d expect to be at the high end of that if not for better, but we still have a lot of work going on margin expansion to come from these initiatives in \u201816 and beyond. I can\u2019t at this point \u2013 all right I don\u2019t want to give you at this point an incremental margin sums up of 2015 this will be part of when we get all together we\u2019ll be able to give you our best view at that point.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Research","Outside of the initiatives, sort of a historical baseline is the way to think about it? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m making sure when I\u2019m listening, some thoughts I already have your pension or just any other company is leave to go. So without getting into these are kind of small pieces of a bigger puzzle. But since you are asking specifically pension has not been a tailwind this year in a significant way and we don\u2019t expect it to be a significant headwind in 2015. The other item that is may be worth talking about is currency, we called $0.04 of headwind here in the fourth quarter which we believe which is every manageable. There could be some headwind in currency in 2015 depending on where rates are at the time and we think that\u2019s very manageable at this point.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Research","All right.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Karen Fletcher","Thanks, Brandon. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we'll discuss second quarter financial results and update you on the outlook for the remainder of 2018.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the third quarter and full year 2018 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2017 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott?","Scott Santi","Thank you, Karen, and good morning. ITW delivered another strong quarter, with revenue up 7% and organic growth of 4%. EPS of $1.97 was up 17% versus prior year and ahead of our expectations despite a $0.03 currency headwind versus the prior guidance. And that's a translation headwind. If you exclude the benefit from a legal settlement we received in the second quarter of last year, EPS was up 19% year-on-year. We delivered strong results on all key financial metrics, including operating income of $932 million, up 9%; operating margin of 24.3%, up 50 basis points; and after-tax ROIC at 28.7%, up 440 basis points.","Underlying demand trends remained strong as evidenced by all 7 business segments in major geographies, delivering positive organic growth in the quarter. In particular, CapEx-related demand continued to spur strong organic growth in our Test & Measurement and Electronics and our Welding segments. And we saw improving growth momentum in Food Equipment, with growth 120 basis points higher sequentially versus Q1.","Overall, the company delivered 4% organic growth despite 40 basis points of unfavorable impact from North American auto builds, which ended up being down 3% year-over-year versus an IHS forecast heading into the quarter that they would be up 3%. And in addition, we had 70 basis points of Product Line Simplification in the quarter. Michael will share more on -- more details a little later in the call. Overall, our teams are working to offset raw material cost increases on an ongoing basis, and through the first half, we have offset the impact of those raw material cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we continue, despite the rising raw material cost environment, to expand margins. ","Continued progress in implementing our Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points margin benefit in Q2 and in the first half as our business teams continued to apply our proprietary business model to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. Looking ahead, we have adjusted our full year guidance to account for current foreign exchange rates, which, at the current levels, present roughly a 12% impact to the second half compared to the end of Q1 when we last updated guidance. We expect to deliver 15% EPS growth for the full year as we continue to execute well, accelerate organic growth and expand margins. We are well positioned to deliver continued strong results as we enter the second half of the year.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael for more detail on the quarter. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thanks, Scott. Organic revenue growth of 4% was up more than 100 basis points sequentially, and we're seeing good growth momentum across our business portfolio and in every major geography. Product Line Simplification in the quarter reduced organic growth by 70 basis points, and softer North American auto builds versus the industry forecast heading into the quarter was a 40 basis points drag on our overall organic growth rate. We add those back, we would have been right around 5% organic growth.","By segment, Welding led the way as demand continued to accelerate, delivering 13% organic growth; followed by Test & Measurement and Electronics and Specialty both up 4%. Scott mentioned good sequential growth momentum in our Food Equipment business, and this was particularly evident in our North America foodservice equipment side with growth of 13% in Q2 following 7% in Q1 and a positive outlook for the second half.","Earnings per share of $1.97 were $0.02 above the $1.95 midpoint of our guidance despite a $0.03 unfavorable currency translation impact. Operating margins was strong at 24.3%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, excluding the prior year legal settlement, and up 20 basis points sequentially. Free cash flow was really good at $533 million, up 38% versus prior year. And we repurchased 500 million of our shares this quarter for a total of $1 billion in the first half of 2018.","Moving to Chart #4 and operating margin. Like I said, strong margin performance as operating margin continued to improve sequentially and year-over-year. Operating margin of 24.3% was up 50 basis points versus prior year when excluding last year's benefit from a legal settlement. Similar to Q1, strong execution by our teams of Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of margin improvement. And volume leverage from higher organic growth added another 70 basis points in the quarter. Pricing actions continue across the company as we execute on our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. I'll cover this and tariffs in more detail on Slide 10. Finally, we continue to invest in CapEx and people to support and further accelerate our long-term growth strategies. These growth investments amounted to 60 basis points.","Turning to Chart #5 for a look at our first half performance. We delivered strong performance with revenue up 7%, organic growth of 3% and earnings per share up 20%. All segments and major geographies contributed positive organic growth. Across the board, there was excellent operational execution with continued margin improvement as operating margin improved 70 basis points in the first half with Enterprise Initiatives, again, contributing 110 basis points. Pricing actions offset cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we just completed the most profitable first half in the company's history and have really good growth and margin momentum heading into the second half.","Let's move on to Chart #6 and segment performance. Table on the left summarizes organic growth by segment for first and second quarter. And you can see the good growth momentum we're building, with 5 out of 7 segments improving sequentially. Overall, organic growth was 4% in Q2, which, as I mentioned, includes PLS initiative impact of 70 basis points. We remain confident that we will deliver 3% to 4% organic growth in Q3 and for the full year based on current run rates. The table also shows segment operating margins for the first and second quarters with strong margin performance across the board as all segments improved sequentially, except auto where pricing actions take a little longer to take hold.","Now moving to the right side of the chart and an overview of our Automotive business. Organic growth was 3%, up from 1% in Q1. Looking at the regions, our North America growth of 2% was 5 percentage points above builds, which were actually down 3% in the quarter. You'll remember that on our last earnings call, I shared that the Q2 North American build forecast from IHS was up 3%. Had North American builds been at the original forecast, our total segment growth rate would have been 1.5 percentage points higher, well above 4%.","China organic growth continues to be very strong at plus 17%, 8 points above builds. And Europe was up 3%, 1 point below builds, mostly on mix and PLS in the region. Overall, in Automotive, PLS had roughly a 4 percentage point impact to organic growth in Q2. Finally, if you look across these 3 major regions, our weighted average penetration was about 250 basis points above the build rate. Margin expanded by 20 basis points, with Enterprise Initiatives and new product penetration offsetting cost inflation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect organic growth around 3% in the second half, with margins holding steady.","Moving on to Chart #7. Food Equipment organic revenue was up 2%, and on a very positive note, we continue to see a strong recovery in institutional sales, particularly in education, as foodservice equipment sales were up 13% in the quarter, partially offset by decline in retail. Operating margin of 25.4% was up 80 basis points sequentially but down year-over-year due to slightly higher restructuring in Europe this quarter versus prior year and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits from Enterprise Initiatives. Price\/cost did not have a significant margin impact in Food Equipment. Looking forward, we expect the Food Equipment segment to accelerate organic growth and expand margins in the second half. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was up 4%; once again, particularly strong performance driven by strong CapEx spending in Test & Measurement, which was up 7%. Electronics was flat this quarter, primarily due to timing of large equipment orders in electronic assembly. Operating margin improved by 160 basis points to 23.5%.","Now Chart #8. Welding's organic growth rate continued to accelerate in Q2, and the backlog for the second half is looking very good. Organic growth was 13%, with global equipment up 15% and consumables up 11%. North America was up 17% with strong demand across all end markets, including oil and gas. Margin expanded by 210 basis points to 29.3%. Polymers & Fluids, organic growth was 1% and operating margin was essentially flat despite significant cost increases tied to chemicals, silicone and resins.","Chart 9. Construction delivered 2% organic growth in the quarter with North American growth of 2%, European growth of 4% and flat in Asia Pacific. 6% growth in North America residential was partially offset by declining commercial construction where we were impacted by a onetime wedge anchor product issue. Excluding this issue, commercial construction was down 5%. This segment also had a 1 percentage point impact from PLS initiatives in the quarter. Specialty organic growth was up 4% this quarter, driven by strong equipment sales that were up 23%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 28.1%.","Moving on to Chart #10 with an update on raw material costs and tariffs. As we've talked about before, we continue to execute our strategy to cover cost inflation with pricing actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We've done that year-to-date and expect to do the same in the second half. For perspective, full year projected cost inflation, including tariff impact, represents approximately 3% of our total spend.","As many of you know, our model is to source and produce where we sell. And this approach helps significantly mitigate the risk associated with tariffs. By our estimate, the impact of tariffs represent about 10% to 15% of our total projected cost inflation in 2018. In addition, only 2% of ITW's material spend is sourced from China. Our \"produce where we sell\" model and the very limited cross-border movement of raw materials and products certainly helps mitigate the impact from tariffs.","The bottom line for ITW is that the combination of continued progress on organic growth, which is underway right now, coupled with the strength and resiliency of our business model and our high-quality business portfolio and the excellent operation execution of our teams who are delivering over 100 basis points in Enterprise Initiatives, will drive continued margin expansion and strong earnings growth in 2018. Our guidance midpoint reflects margin expansion of about 80 basis points this year, following 70 basis points realized in the first half.","Let's go to Chart #11 and 2018 guidance. As mentioned, we see strength in demand trends across our segments and continued strong margin expansion from Enterprise Initiatives with clear line of sight to projects and activities that will contribute at least another 100 basis points of margin improvement again this year. While we expect raw material cost inflation to continue to impact margins in the second half, we're confident that we will offset those cost increases with price actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, so there is no negative impact to earnings. The price\/cost impact to margin is reflected in our updated operating margin guidance of 24% to 25%. Again, this is strictly a margin percentage point impact, not an earnings impact.","As we always do, we've updated guidance for foreign exchange rates as we sit here today, which has a $0.12 impact in the second half versus the exchange rates in place at the time we updated guidance at the end of last quarter. As a result, for the full year 2018, we're adjusting the EPS guidance midpoint by $0.10 and expect earnings in the range of $7.50 to $7.70 per share, which represents 15% EPS growth at the midpoint versus the $6.59 underlying earnings per share in 2017. On the top line, currency is expected to be a 1 percentage point impact in Q3 and Q4 versus prior year quarters.","With respect to cash, we expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income or better. Through the first half, we repurchased $1 billion of our shares and now expect to repurchase an additional $500 million in the second half. As a reminder, subject to board approval in August, we plan to significantly raise our dividend as we increase ITW's dividend payout ratio to 50% of free cash flow. Today, we're also providing guidance for Q3, a range of $1.80 to $1.90 per share versus $1.71 in the third quarter 2017. As a reminder, we had a $0.14 benefit in the third quarter last year from a legal settlement. Finally, we expect organic growth of 3% to 4% based on current run rates.","So to wrap up, we continue to see positive underlying demand trends across our businesses. We're well positioned to continue to deliver strong margin expansion and earnings growth in 2018. On price\/cost, we continue to execute well on an effective strategy and the impact is manageable. Our guidance today reflects solid organic growth with best-in-class margins and returns, including 15% year-over-year earnings growth and strong cash flows. All in, another strong year supported by our performance at the halfway mark and our confidence in ITW's ability to continue to execute at a high level through the balance of 2018.","Karen, back to you.","Karen Fletcher","Thanks, Michael. Brandon, let's go ahead and open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Scott or Michael, this question is going to be a bit nitpicky because we know that you have still very high margin, but it seems like there has just been a little more volatility in some of your segments' margins over the last couple quarters, arguably outside of price versus cost. So if you look at Food Equipment, you guys talked about it, but down 100 basis points year-over-year this quarter after being down last quarter. And at the company level, you cited 60 basis points of growth, investments, other, which you said was an investment in people but maybe a surprise, at least to us. You did mention more PLS in Food Equipment. Are you having to do more PLS than you thought or the investment in people you've mentioned at the company as a whole? And do you think this increased level of noise will diminish moving forward?","Michael Larsen","So there was a lot there, Andy, but I think the bottom line is that we are very close to executing the plan that we laid out at the beginning of the year. Really, the only delta that's meaningful is the price\/cost equation, and that's just the margin percentage impact that we talked about. In terms of overall organic growth, margin expansion from Enterprise Initiatives continue in every segment. They're broad-based. We're not done on the Enterprise Initiatives. More to come in the second half and beyond that. So you're pointing out Food Equipment. Like I mentioned, we had slightly higher restructuring in Europe here in the quarter, about 40 basis points. And the balance really is a product mix item in Q2. But like we also said, in Food Equipment specifically, we expect, just based on the orders, the run rate, continued progress here in the back half on organic growth as well as margin expansion. On PLS, we are running at about 70 basis points here in Q2, similar to what we did in Q1. And as you know, that is completely consistent with the way we run our businesses and are really an integral part of our 80\/20 operating system. And very briefly, what it does is positions us for continued acceleration in organic growth with better margins and returns. So it's absolutely the right thing to do for a little bit of headwind on the top line here in the short term.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Michael, could I just have you clarify the 60 basis points of growth investment still? Was that sort of in the plan? And you talked about adding people, where are you adding people or at least you said investment in people?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So we've seen, if you look at the details, an increase in overall levels of investment really to support and further accelerate the organic growth rate. You've seen that now 4 years in a row. We're making progress on the organic growth rate up 4% here in Q2. So a portion of it is CapEx-related as well as new products. And then people is really investment in talent that can support everything we need to do to further accelerate our organic growth rate as well as continue to execute well on our Enterprise Initiatives.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. If I could just shift gears briefly and ask you about organic growth. Last quarter, you said that you thought all of your segments would have better organic growth in Q2 than Q1. We see Test & Measurement and Construction had a little bit lower organic growth. I think you explained Construction well with the commercial construction issue in the quarter. In Test & Measurement, looks like Electronics slowed down a bit. So maybe you can talk about that segment in particular.","Michael Larsen","It's really not that significant, Andy. I mean, we -- Electronics business was flat in the quarter, really based on some timing, as I think I mentioned, on some large equipment orders. If you were to adjust for that, that's -- Electronics would have been up 4%. And then the Construction item I talked about, if you adjust for that, the Construction business would have been up in that 3% to 4% range.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So no changes to either segment for the year in terms of overall balance, would you say?","Michael Larsen","They're all, I'd say, pretty close. We talked about Automotive. We have a fairly, hopefully, conservative assumption here at 3% for the balance of the year. And then we continue to see acceleration in Welding and, hopefully, some good progress also on Food Equipment.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","So my first question, maybe just focusing on the growth investments again. I just want to understand that a little bit better. I guess if -- you guys have obviously done a great job the last few years driving strong margin expansion, good cost control. I guess the -- if you look at this line item, I think some folks will say perhaps you guys got too close to the bone and now have to reinvest in either people or CapEx. So maybe talk about that a little bit on your -- where you think you are today from a growth perspective and the investment that you need to make in the second half of the year and maybe even into 2019.","Michael Larsen","Yes, Joe, nothing -- if you look back over the last 5 years, we have continued to invest in organic growth and everything that we need to do to support an acceleration in our organic growth rates. So there's really nothing significantly different. We are seeing a -- an increase in our CapEx spend here really to support our customers, which were growing at a fairly rapid rate. So I -- and if you look at it, 60 basis points is not really that meaningful, that big a number on a dollar basis. It just happens to be something that we call out here on the margin walk.","Scott Santi","Well, and what I would add is that we have -- we're trying to be more transparent in terms of how we're investing in growth. This is not a new item this quarter. This is something we've been doing for the last 5 years. The presentation is a little different, but ultimately, these investments had been ongoing for the last 5 years. They're embedded, and when we talk about 35% long-term incrementals, those growth investments are embedded in that number. So it is not a new item that just happened this quarter. These investments have been going on for the last 5 years. We've changed the presentation a bit just to reflect, given some of what we heard about, \"Are you investing enough in growth given the kind of margin and progress that you've made over the last 5 years?\" So these are -- this isn't a new item. This is -- these are investments that have been taking place consistently over the last 5 years.","Joseph Ritchie","Got it. That's helpful clarification, Scott. If I can maybe turn the conversation a little bit to organic growth and specifically just focus on Auto for a second. I know you've got 3% baked in for the back half. But I think this is the first quarter we've seen you guys actually under-pace global auto builds. And so maybe just talk a little bit more about what happened there specifically this quarter, that would be helpful.","Michael Larsen","Yes, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, the global build number includes geographies where we do not have a presence or do not have a significant presence. So if you look at places like Brazil, India, even in Japan, for example. So the right way to look at this is really on a geographic basis, which is the way we laid it out in the slides and described it. And you can see North America, up 5 points of penetration gains there; in China, 8 points; Europe, some mix, and PLS activities there were slightly below. And like I said, on a weighted average basis, we are at 250 basis points, in that 2 to 4 percentage point range that we've been in for the last 4, 5 years. And based on all the projects that we booked already, we expect to remain in that range in the future.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. And, Michael, maybe one last one. The share buyback and the repatriation, I may have missed it, but did you guys give an update on how far along you are with repatriating the $2 billion that you expected this year?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So we made some really good progress. We are slightly above $2 billion year-to-date and ahead of schedule. So the obvious question is, how are you going to allocate that repatriation, those cash -- those funds that have been repatriated, the little over $2 billion. So we've reduced our short-term debt about $900 million. Our share repurchases, we just took it up, the target for the year, by $500 million. We've got a dividend increase coming. If you pencil that out, that's about a $200 million increase for the year. And then we have slightly more cash on hand here in the near term. And as you know, we have some maturities coming up in the first half of '19. So really good progress. I'm very pleased with the fact that we were able to accelerate those plans and bring the funds back to the U.S.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi","I'm just trying to understand the reduction to the margin outlook a little bit better. I mean, you seem to be moving forward on the Enterprise Initiatives and you continue to say you'll offset raw material costs dollar-for-dollar. So what has actually changed on a margin standpoint?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think we're through the first half here, and we are updating the margin guidance now for our current view of how price\/cost, again, only from a margin percentage standpoint, will impact our overall operating margins for the year. It's -- again, it's not an impact to EPS, which does not what -- you're not seeing that, you're not hearing that from us today. It's purely just a reflection of what we've seen year-to-date on price\/cost and our expectations for the balance of the year. I want to just point out, we're still -- year-to-date, we've expanded margins 70 basis points for the full year. With our updated guidance here, we expect at the midpoint to expand margins 80 basis points. So that's really the only driver here, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. So just to be clear, the reduction to the margin outlook is purely -- is for price\/cost. The reduction to the EPS outlook is for FX.","Michael Larsen","That is correct.","Scott Santi","Correct.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. And just back on autos. I mean, are you seeing any signs of disruption? I mean, obviously, Daimler was complaining about the trade war already having an impact on U.S. auto exports to China. And you've seen some other announcements from various auto companies. Anything going on there that you feel like is impacting your business? And can you clarify a little bit more about these tariffs making up 10% to 15% of your raw material inflation? Where specifically in the portfolio is that showing up?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So I think, Ross, the short answer to your question is we've not seen anything with our customers. It might be a little too early to tell. There's still some movement around what these tariffs may or may not be and for how long they may be in place. So and again, we are a \"produce where we sell\" company, and the impact from tariffs is significantly mitigated by that. In terms of the overall tariff impact, it's -- as a result of that, fairly small, 10% to 15% of what we project for the full year will come from tariffs. The majority of that is really related to metals, so steel and aluminum, which was the first round of tariffs. And then the China tariffs will pretty -- I'd say pretty broad-based across the portfolio but pretty small impact overall from that -- from the Section 301 tariffs.","Operator","Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore ISI.","David Raso","Maybe I missed it, the price\/cost drag on margins, what is the number now for the year? And then also if you can give us some insight on 3Q and 4Q.","Michael Larsen","Yes. We're in that -- consistent with the first half, 60 to 70 basis points range is what we're projecting at this point.","David Raso","For each quarter?","Scott Santi","And that's the 3% price recovery on the 3% in place.","Michael Larsen","Correct.","Scott Santi","So little margin...","David Raso","But again, the cadence is similar? Third quarter, fourth quarter year-over-year drag is similar for both [indiscernible]...","Michael Larsen","Yes, it's similar. You could -- yes, it's the same assumption for Q3 and for Q4.","David Raso","The reason I ask, when I try to get to the EPS for the third quarter, the fourth quarter, you seem to be implying for the third quarter the operating margins, even adjusting for the year-ago legal settlement, the margins are flattish to down a bit. But you then need, for the fourth quarter, margins to grow over 100 basis points. And I do see the organic implied is a little faster in the fourth quarter, about 4%; third quarter, 3.5%. So maybe that explains it. But I was kind of hoping to hear on -- maybe making the guide seem easier, that the third quarter drag on price\/cost was greater in the fourth quarter. There's some relief, right, some of the pricing actions take hold and the margin drag becomes a lot less. If that's not the case, can you explain why the margins in the third quarter were flat to down, but fourth quarter, they pop back up year-over-year?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So we don't give margin guidance for Q3 and Q4, but the price\/cost impact is modeled or estimated to be the same in Q3 and Q4. The big delta -- and I don't -- not knowing your model specifically, and so what you have to factor in is really currency. So if you look at the impact from currency in the second half of the year is negative on a year-over-year basis versus being positive in the first half. So I don't know how you've updated your model for that, but that's really the main driver here in the back half of the year.","David Raso","Okay. We can take it offline. And on Auto, when you gave the second half organic, at least the quick numbers that I ran, it implies the full year organic went down about 200 basis points. But the offsets, the other segments, the -- I mean, I would assume Welding was a big piece of it. But to make up for the 200 bps lower on Auto, I mean, ideally, if you can give us like you gave us that for the first quarter, maybe a full year organic sales number for each segment, how you're thinking about it or just...","Michael Larsen","Yes. So I'm not sure I can do that for you, David. But like I said, I think we adjusted the outlook for Auto. I think we've seen the IHS forecast may not be the most -- haven't been the most reliable data point year-to-date. And so we've put in a 3% growth rate for the back half for Auto. The acceleration really is Welding, and then like I mentioned, some improvement in Food Equipment. Those are the big ones. There's a couple of other puts and takes here, but that's really the -- those are the big drivers.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen Volkmann","Maybe just a couple of clarifications. The -- Michael, the PLS headwind in the second half same as first half. And the cadence question as well is sort of 3Q, 4Q the same?","Michael Larsen","Yes. I would -- the same for the second half as the first half, so right around 70 basis points.","Stephen Volkmann","And again, 3Q, 4Q pretty similar?","Michael Larsen","Yes.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, great. And then just with respect to the remaining $500 million of repo, is that -- should we spread that evenly over the third and fourth quarters?","Michael Larsen","I think from a planning perspective, that's probably a good way to do it.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay. And then my final one, just quickly again, is on this price\/cost thing. Is it your goal to just cover the dollar-for-dollar and leave it at that? Or do we think there will come a point once all the pricing is kind of through the system and everything kind of renormalizes, say, 2019, will you get back the margin as well as the dollars? Or do we just leave it at the dollars and move on?","Michael Larsen","No, I think you're raising a really good point. In the near term, what we're doing is covering dollar-for-dollar. But eventually, when we get ahead of this, this will be a positive to margins at some point. When -- we're always operating a little bit of a lag here. We see the cost increases come through. We react on pricing. And we're still, I would say, in a little bit of a catch-up mode, but we will absolutely get ahead of costs here at some point.","Scott Santi","There's roughly a one-quarter lag on average in terms of cost versus price response.","Michael Larsen","Right.","Scott Santi","And so the dollar-for-dollar, if I can say it a slightly different way, that coverage is factoring in that lag. So we're still able to cover -- minimize the EPS impact in the near term. But should the cost increases stop tomorrow, then those pricing actions will continue to carry through and have a positive impact beyond the dollar-for-dollar.","Michael Larsen","Correct, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Mig Dobre with Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Just looking to clarify a comment you made on Food. As I understood it, it was Welding and Food organic expectations that ticked up to offset Auto. And I guess I'm wondering here what the thinking is because your prior guidance talked about 2% to 3% growth. Even towards the low end of your full year guidance, that would imply pretty significant acceleration in the back half versus what you've done in the front half of this year. Is there enough in your backlog or visibility to where we could be thinking that this -- that, that can grow north of 4% organically in the back half?","Michael Larsen","Are you talking about Food Equipment?","Mircea Dobre","Yes, I am.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So we've got a number of things going on there. One is you saw the acceleration on the institutional side and the really strong backlog going into the second half as well as you're going to get some benefits from pricing and a number of new product launches in the back half of the year.","Mircea Dobre","Okay. So this is more sort of internally driven rather than end market-driven, that's what you're saying.","Michael Larsen","Well, I think the foodservice side is certainly improving. We don't expect the retail side to improve. And then if you just look at the comps on a year-over-year basis, they also are going to be a tailwind here in the second half.","Mircea Dobre","Okay. And then if I may go back to this question on growth investments that you've broken out in \\guidance. Obviously, a new way to present this, but I guess, from my standpoint, when I'm looking at this bridge here, you typically talk about Enterprise Initiatives as well as volume, price\/cost and so on. I'm looking at this and I'm interpreting this as incremental investments that are essentially offsetting Enterprise Initiatives at this point. If that's wrong, why is it wrong? And what should we expect for this growth investment drag to be going forward?","Michael Larsen","So first of all, I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate from Q2 and assume that we're going to have 60 basis points every quarter going forward. I do -- I think Scott explained very well why we're calling it out. But it also would not be a good assumption to think that the 60 basis points offset the Enterprise Initiatives. So I think really the way to think about this is unchanged relative to what we've done in prior years, which is core incrementals in a normal macro environment in that 35% range, plus the Enterprise Initiatives on top of that. That's really the way to think about this. And that's how you -- that really supports what we've been saying for a while now is that we expect margins to continue to improve from here.","Mircea Dobre","But if that is the case and growth was included in Enterprise Initiatives previously -- I don't know. To me, as I read this table, something seems to be materially different, and I guess I'll just leave it at that.","Michael Larsen","Well, we can take it offline. I don't think you're interpreting what we're saying and what's on the chart correctly.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Can we talk a little bit more about the negative mix in your PLS model that you mentioned? What specifically is that? And how should we think about that toward the back half of this year?","Michael Larsen","Well, that's really mixed with -- at this point, it becomes in terms of -- by OEM as well as by model. And so I would not read too much into that. There was -- again, it's one quarter. If you look at it historically, these penetration numbers can move around quite a bit, depending on when models kind of roll off and when new models kick in. The main driver here in terms of being slightly below the builds was really the PLS work that the team is doing.","Ann Duignan","Okay. So it's not, as we might appear, the loss of a platform or the loss of an OEM customer?","Scott Santi","No. The penetrate -- obviously, as what Michael said, the penetration numbers on a quarter -- 1-quarter basis are not good gauges. The annual numbers absolutely are. And what -- we will continue to deliver penetration gains in Europe on a full year basis this year. But things do jump around, as Michael said, in a quarter based on when a model is going up, when a new model is being launched and some of the supply chain work behind the scenes that goes on in preparing for that.","Ann Duignan","Sure. I appreciate that. And then another point of clarification. On the commercial construction side, I think you said you had a product issue. Can you talk about that and what that means and what the outlook is for the commercial construction side for the back half?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So commercial construction has kind of been flattish for a while now. We were down slightly, I think I said down 5%. When you exclude this onetime event, really limited to North America with our wedge anchor product resulting in some returns, if you adjust for that onetime event here in the quarter, Construction would have been up 3% in commercial.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And then the wedge anchor problems, can you talk about those? It's sort of uncharacteristic for ITW to have quality issues, but [indiscernible].","Michael Larsen","Yes, I know. We had some inaccurate labeling on the packaging, and we had to correct for that.","Ann Duignan","Okay. So not a product quality issue?","Michael Larsen","No.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew Casey","On Auto OEM, you mentioned second half expected to be 3% organic growth. Could you help us understand how you may be treating the impact of what appeared to be a North American supply chain disruption, not for you specifically but would have impacted some of your customers? I'm wondering how you're treating that in the outlook. Are you just extrapolating Q2 as is? Or are you including...","Michael Larsen","No. Yes, we have -- so you're right. There were some issues in Q1 that we talked about last time. There were some issues in Q2. Not specific to us, and that may be one of the reasons why the IHS forecast was off. IHS calls for North America specifically for significantly higher growth here in Q3 and Q4. We took a conservative approach here and risk-adjusted those numbers and put in a 3% growth rate for Automotive in the back half. Hopefully, that turns out to be a conservative assumption, but that's kind of what we have in our guidance today.","Andrew Casey","Okay. And then I guess another round at the growth investments. You mentioned CapEx comments. Are you seeing any market segments where production may have been constrained and may offer restock opportunities in the future? I'm just trying to understand the CapEx part of it.","Michael Larsen","No. I think it's just part of our -- as these businesses grow, we continue to invest in CapEx. We've done that for 5 years and even beyond that. I mean, typically, CapEx for us as a percentage of sales is right around 2%. And as sales grow, the CapEx numbers go up, and that's really all that you're seeing here. Again, this is to continue to support our customers with best-in-class quality and service on a global basis. And I really wouldn't read as much into it as the time we spent on it today.","Andrew Casey","Okay. And then one last one on it. You mentioned -- or you cautioned against extrapolating the 60 basis points. Was that more lumpy in the quarter than what you'll be seeing in the second half?","Michael Larsen","On the growth investments? Yes, I think this can be a little circumstantial to the quarter. I think we will continue to lean in on these investments that we need to make to further support and accelerate organic growth as well as continue to expand margins, core margins in our businesses. So this is ongoing. I think we called it out this time. And given the reaction today, we may not call it out in the future. We'll have to see. But this is an ongoing thing. It's not a response to anything specific. We are fully invested here. We're fortunate that even these investments -- by fully funding every good project inside the company, they only consume 25% of our operating cash flow. So we're not constrained. We'll continue to invest. And we wanted to highlight that today, and that's what you're seeing on that side.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher","When I look at the European auto build outperformance of your business versus the market, it's really been moderating since the -- going back to the second quarter of last year with obviously the flip to negative this quarter. So has that been mix in that trend down all along for the last year? And then what kind of gives you the visibility to that inflecting back positively in the second half?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think in Automotive, and this is not a European comment, this is a global comment, we are fortunate that we have visibility 2.5, 3 years out based on the projects we've sold already. So we know what our content per vehicle growth is going to be on new model launches. We know what's rolling off. There can be some mix as these 2, those are the big variables, kind of play out, but we're highly confident that we'll continue to outperform in Europe and on a global basis in that 2 to 4 percentage point range above the global auto build numbers. And that's really on -- the way to look at this is what Scott said is really on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, it can move around a little bit. But absolutely nothing has changed in terms of our confidence in our visibility to continue to do that on a go-forward basis.","Steven Fisher","But that outperformance is basically 0 for the first half, so the second half would have to inflect positively. It sounds like you do have that visibility in Europe right now?","Michael Larsen","Well, again, I mean, we can talk about Europe offline. I mean, I think if you look at this on a global basis, we had 2 percentage points of penetration in the first quarter. We just did 2.5% above the weighted average, and nothing has changed.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then shifting over to the commercial construction, just to make sure I heard all the numbers right. The minus 5% on commercial, that was excluding the anchor wedge product issue?","Michael Larsen","Yes. We would have been down 15% -- we're down 15%. We would have been 5% if it wasn't for this onetime item.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And I think it was down 2% in the first quarter. So where generally are you seeing sort of incremental weakness? Or is that just a comparison issue between Q1 and Q2 year-over-year?","Michael Larsen","I would think that's really more of a rounding issue. Commercial is about 20% of our Construction business. And the performance of that segment is really driven much more by the continued growth on the residential and the renovation side.","Scott Santi","Of the Construction business, not the commercial.","Steven Fisher","Okay. So maybe just one quick clarification. Did your short-term debt go up a lot in the quarter? And I thought you said when you were talking about repatriation, you were talking about reducing short-term debt.","Michael Larsen","Yes, that's correct. So that's a reclassification of the maturities that I talked about that are coming due in the first half of '19. So we have some March and April maturities, $1.35 billion. And that -- because we're within 12 months, that slips into the short-term debt category, that's why. If you look at the long-term debt, we're down by the same number.","Operator","Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","So I guess just first question around the price\/cost issue. If you could kind of talk a little bit about from a segment perspective where that has the most impact. I know you kind of said it's not happening -- or it's not a significant issue within Food Equipment, but it would be helpful to know where it is.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So the largest impact is really in the Automotive segment where it can take a little bit longer for price actions, new products to offset those cost increases. Everywhere else, we're positive on a year-to-date basis.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. That's really helpful. And then the other question. Just looking at Welding margins, the incrementals were really strong this quarter. I think they were like 44%, clearly above what you tend to target. Just thinking about like the outlook into the second half of the year, is that level of margin expansion or incrementals sustainable into the second half? And I guess a little bit of just what's driving the strength.","Michael Larsen","Yes. No, I think this is frankly typical for what we're seeing in Welding with this type of organic growth. So those are -- that's a reasonable assumption for incrementals for the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","A bit of a more philosophical question on the impact of some of the -- all the uncertainty in trade and that kind of thing. I would have thought you guys would maybe start seeing some impact on your customers' CapEx spending as all of this uncertainty weighs on their investment decisions. Maybe that led to some of the under build in Auto OEM. Instron was still pretty good. Just any kind of commentary you guys have, what you're hearing out there in the market in terms of, are customers still confident in the economic outlook here? Are you seeing any kind of weakening in just the way people are thinking about the economy going forward?","Michael Larsen","No, we've not seen that, Nathan. I mean, I think if you look at the segments most exposed to business investment, CapEx cycle, Welding, Test & Measurement, we continue to see. And the equipment side of Specialty continued to see accelerating demand. So we have not seen any impact from a demand standpoint.","Nathan Jones","Polymers & Fluids and Specialty Products both seem to have relatively flat kind of margins here. I figure there's probably a bit more oil impacting that. Is that something that you should be -- we should be expecting to see a little improvement in that as you catch up a bit more in pricing with the, I guess, more recent history of cost increases going through there?","Michael Larsen","I think in the near term, there certainly, as you point out, some chemicals, so silicones, specifically resins, are putting some pressure on. But as -- once we work through that, those segments are going to continue to expand margins.","Nathan Jones","Okay. And then just one housekeeping one. You had the other income line pick up fairly significantly in this quarter. Can you talk about what drove that up? And do you forecast the number for that in your model? Or is it just a 0 in your guidance?","Michael Larsen","Well, there's always some puts and takes. I mean, it can move around a little bit on a quarterly basis. The majority of what's in that bucket is really interest income. And so linked to some of the repatriation we talked about, we saw a pretty significant increase in the other income bucket. We do include an assumption in the guidance, and we also do for the back half, which is right around current levels. But like I said, it can move around a little bit on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Operator","Our last question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just a couple of things here. First, just on Welding. I'd love to get a little more color there. I guess no good deed goes unpunished, right? You talked about Welding today. But if you could give us a little bit of color on where you're seeing the most strength and if there's any indication that customers are perhaps pre-buying. And I ask that in the spirit, Lincoln, for example, has raised price 3 times in the last 6 or 7 months, right? We're chasing price up pretty rapidly in this business. Do you see any unusual customer behavior in the channel as a result of that?","Michael Larsen","We really haven't. I mean, I think to give you a little bit more color, overall, Welding up 13%, with Equipment up 15%, Consumables moving up double-digit. And then North America is really the key driver of the business, which represents 80% of our sales. We talked about the industrial side before, so that would be heavy equipment, auto up really strong, more than 20%, and the commercial side continues in the high single digits this quarter. I know you're a big offshore guy. We have not seen a pickup in offshore, but overall, oil and gas was up 7% here in the quarter, which is certainly encouraging.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, that's helpful. And then just on Auto real quick. With this European testing logjam, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that, but the WLTP, do you see any disproportionate negative seasonality in your Auto business in Q3 as part of your back half guide?","Michael Larsen","In Europe specifically?","Jeffrey Sprague","In Europe specifically, yes.","Michael Larsen","Yes, no, we have not seen that.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just one last one for me. Just on the Test & Measurement\/Electronics, maybe Electronics a little bit more specifically. There is a lot of pressure and noise in just kind of the whole electronics supply chain, semi CapEx, et cetera, particularly rippling through Asia. Do you have visibility on what the back half looks like in that business? Maybe a little extra color there would be helpful.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think the -- for Electronics, the back half looks good, similar to what we were seeing in the first half. We do have a little bit of semi exposure in that business, which may be going through a little bit of a slowdown in the near term but then is expected to pick back up in Q4. Not enough to really move the needle for us, but overall, the team feels really good going into the second half here.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. I think that brings us to the top of the hour. Thanks, everybody. And if you have follow-up questions, I'm available. That concludes our call.","Michael Larsen","All right. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference.

The telephone replay for the conference call is (888) 393-9645. No passcode is necessary to access the replay, and the playback will be available through midnight of February 12. Now let me introduce our CEO, Scott Santi. Scott?","E. Scott Santi","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a few comments on full year 2012. In a challenging global economic environment, we were able to deliver solid operating performance, while at the same time rolling out and mobilizing the company behind a number of key initiatives related to our 2012 to 2017 enterprise strategy.","Our organic revenues grew 2% in 2012 due primarily to strong year-on-year growth from our auto OEM, welding and test and measurement segments. We also delivered 50 basis points of operating margin improvement, and we grew our adjusted earnings per share 10%.","Last month at our investor meeting in New York City, we detailed the enterprise strategy that we are undertaking to position the company to deliver solid growth and even stronger margins and returns on capital in the context of an increasingly challenging global competitive environment. Through the execution of our enterprise strategy, we are narrowing our focus to areas of opportunity where we can fully leverage ITW's unique core capabilities. We have detailed execution plans in place for 2013 around 3 key initiatives associated with our enterprise strategy. Those are portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing. We have covered these initiatives in detail in other forums, so won't be going them -- going into them in detail here. But I can assure you that the entire organization is aligned behind and focused on driving meaningful progress on all 3 in 2013.","I do want to reiterate the performance goals that we are committed to achieving by 2017 through the execution of our enterprise strategy, and those are: organic growth at 200-plus basis points above global industrial production, operating margins of 20%-plus, returns on invested capital of 20%-plus and free cash flow conversion of at least 100% of net income.","Simply put, we have 2 objectives for 2013: one is to run our businesses and execute at a high level in the context of the realities of the economic environment and two is to drive solid progress and momentum in the execution of our enterprise strategy across the company. We are confident that through our enterprise strategy, we are taking the steps necessary to position the company to generate maximum performance leverage and impact from a very unique and robust set of core capabilities, and that our strategy will result in highly differentiated operating performance in the years ahead.","Now let me turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald D. Kropp","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Here are the highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenues decreased 2.3%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures, mainly Decorative Surfaces, which closed on October 31. Excluding the divestiture impact, revenue growth would have been 2.3%, largely driven by organic growth in North America and acquisitions.","Operating income was $609 million, which was lower than last year by $38 million, representing a decline of 5.9%. Operating margins of 14.4% were 60 basis points lower compared to last year. Diluted income per share from continuing operations was $2.10, which included several discrete items, primarily a significant gain on the divestiture of Decorative Surfaces. Excluding the effect of these discrete items, we finished at $0.89 per share.","Overall, both our Q4 top line performance and bottom line earnings were largely in line with our expectations, as growth in North America and Asia offset continued softness in Europe.","As we discussed at the investor meeting in December, we had several significant discrete items this quarter. I want to take a minute to review our fourth quarter reported performance versus our operating performance from October. Our reported EPS on a GAAP basis was $2.10. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a gain of $1.37 on the sale of our former Decorative Surfaces segment. We also recorded the P&L impact of our ongoing 49% interest in the Wilsonart business of negative $0.04, which included activity from November and December, primarily related to transaction expenses and purchase accounting amortization.","In addition, we had some discrete corporate items in the fourth quarter, which resulted in an expense of $0.04 per share. We also had several discrete tax items, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, mainly related to an IRS settlement we reached during the quarter. After excluding these items, our operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.89, which is well within the forecast range we discussed last month.","Now let's go to the components of our operating results. Our 2.3% revenue decline in fourth quarter was primarily due to the following factors: Divestitures, primarily Decorative Surfaces, reduced revenues by 4.6%; base revenues were up 0.6%, with North American base revenues increasing 1.6%; and mixed international base revenues that overall were down 0.5% year-over-year. Our Asia businesses grew 3.7%, led by strong growth in India, as well as solid growth in China. We saw a 2.6% decline in Europe, with a decline in virtually all of our businesses.","Acquisitions added 2.4% to revenue growth, while currency translation decreased revenues by 0.7%. Operating margins for the fourth quarter were 14.4% or 60 basis points lower than Q4 2011. Base business margins were down 40 basis points from last year. Higher sales volume contributed 20 basis points of operating leverage. On the non-volume side, price cost favorability improved margins by 50 basis points but was slightly lower than we were expecting. We also saw some negative impacts from higher pension and benefit cost, which decreased margin 70 basis points; and inventory revaluation from lower material cost, which reduced margins 30 basis points.","In addition, total operating margins were lower by 30 basis points due to dilutive impact of acquisitions. The net operating margins from acquisitions, excluding amortization and other acquisition accounting items, were 12.2% for the quarter. Margins were also lower by 20 basis points due to higher restructuring.","For the full year, revenues were up 0.8%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, revenues grew 2.2%. Operating margins were higher by 50 basis points. Excluding the discrete items that I discussed for the fourth quarter as well as the $0.33 favorable impact of the Australian tax case in 2011, full year EPS from continuing operations was $4.09 or 9.9% higher than 2011.","Our total full year revenue increase is 0.8%, consisting of the following: Base revenue increased 1.7%. North America was strong for the year at a 4.3% growth rate. We had a mixed growth profile internationally that resulted in a 1% decline. John will discuss the full year geographic mix in more detail later in the call.","Acquisitions added 3.1% to revenue growth, while divestitures, primarily Decorative Surfaces, drove a 1.4% reduction in revenue. Currency translation decreased revenues by 2.7%, mainly driven by a weaker euro. The higher full year base business margins of 110 basis points were partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions of 40 basis points. Higher restructuring costs of 30 basis points also reduced margin, as we expect close to $100 million in restructuring activities this year, which was double compared to 2011.","Overall, while international demand was sluggish for the year, our North American markets remained strong for most of the year. Despite our uneven top line growth profile, we saw a 50 basis point improvement in our operating margins as we maintained our 80\/20 operating discipline and continued overhead cost management, while launching our rollout of our enterprise-wide strategy and initiatives.","Looking at working capital and cash flow. Accounts receivable DSO at 58 days was consistent with last year, and inventory months on hand improved slightly to 1.7. ROIC for the year was 15.4%, consistent with 2011. Our ROIC continues to be well above our cost of capital and a key metric for us. As Scott mentioned, we expect the end result from our enterprise strategy will be an ROIC above 20% for 2017 and beyond.","For the fourth quarter, net cash provided from operating activities was $605 million, with capital expenses of -- expenditures of $108 million, resulting in free operating cash flow of $497 million, which was 139% conversion of adjusted income from continuing operations. For the year, we generated nearly $1.7 billion of free operating cash flow, which was a 90% conversion of adjusted income from continuing operations. Excluding the increase in taxes paid due to divestitures, the cash flow conversion rate is north of 100%.","Turning to our capital structure. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be as follows: Our first priority continues to be organic investments, especially focused on our key growth initiatives. Examples of our organic investments include R&D spending, additional investments in manufacturing capacity and restructuring projects, which have long-term margin benefits.","Our next capital priority is dividends. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $350 million. This included the normal January dividend payment, which was accelerated into December to allow our shareholders to benefit from the 2012 dividend tax rate. Our current dividend yield continues to be about 2.5%. Any excess capital after organic investments and dividends is used for external investments, which are either share repurchases or acquisitions. We evaluate allocation between these investments based on the best risk-adjusted returns.","During Q4, we purchased just over $600 million in shares, which brought us to $2 billion worth of share repurchases for the year. As we look to 2013, we expect that our normal share repurchases from free cash flow will be at least $500 million. In addition, we intend to use any U.S. after-tax divestiture proceeds for share repurchases as well. As of the end of the current year, we have approximately $1.9 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under our current buyback program.","For 2012, we returned nearly $2.9 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which was 80% of our available capital. We also utilized $730 million for acquisitions for the year, nearly all of which continue to be focused on our growth platforms in emerging markets.","As we think about 2013 and beyond in the context of portfolio management, 2 factors will be key to our acquisition strategy: a focus on our accelerated growth spaces and a strong differentiation potential.","Lastly, our debt-to-capital ratio dropped to 32% and debt to EBITDA rose slightly to 1.5x during the quarter. Our cash balance overseas is nearly $2.8 billion, and we have plenty of debt capacity to make additional investments.","I will now turn it back over to John, who'll provide more details on the operating results by geography and individual segments.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Ron. Let me take a few moments to review our full year 2012 geographic trends. Excluding the impact of currency, total company revenues grew 4% for the full year, and organic revenues accounted for roughly half of that growth. In 2012, our strongest organic growing geography was North America, as Ron mentioned earlier, which increased 4%.","International organic revenues fell 1%, with European organic revenues declining 2%, roughly in line with our expectations as we came into the year. The better news was that Asia Pacific's organic revenues grew 1%, with India being the principal contributor to the region's growth. Although we started to see a bit of a pickup in China revenue growth in Q4, it probably had more to do with our auto OEM business and the high level of activity there. Organic growth in China for the full year was essentially flat.","Now moving to our Q4 segment table of results. Total company organic revenues grew 60 basis points. And as mentioned earlier, this is led by our Transportation and all other segments that grew organic revenues; 4% and 3%, respectively. As to our operating margins, the majority of our segments produced margin declines in the quarter. As Ron mentioned earlier, higher pension and other benefit costs negatively impacted all segments. In addition, certain segments had unfavorable inventory revaluation adjustments, including Power Systems and Electronics, Construction and Transportation.","The exceptions were our Industrial Packaging and Polymers and Fluids segments that produced operating margin improvements of 140 and 150 basis points, respectively, and this was in large part due to better variable margin performance on product mix and reduced overhead related to restructuring projects.","Now moving to Slide 15. We'll take a closer look at our 7 reporting segments. Starting with our Transportation segment. Our worldwide auto OEM business was once again the key contributor to segment organic growth. Worldwide auto OEM organic revenues grew a very, very strong 11% in Q4, with North America organic revenues increasing 12% and international revenues growing 10%.","It's important to note that our European auto business produced organic revenue growth of 2%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter where our strong product penetration and positive customer mix more than offset a decline in car build. We should note that auto Europe car builds fell 7% in Q4 versus the year-ago period. And one other strong trend to note: Our Asia Pacific auto business, led by our China auto OEM business, grew organic revenues 28% in the quarter.","In summary, if you look on a worldwide basis, our auto businesses produced organic revenue growth that was 9 percentage points higher than the actual increase in worldwide auto production; a strong performance.","In our 2 other businesses, organic revenues for auto aftermarket business declined 5% in Q4, largely due to a loss of a product line with a key customer. And our truck remanufacturing business, which continues to benefit from energy-related projects in Canada and Western United States, produced organic revenue growth of 3%.","Moving to Power System and Electronics segment produced substandard organic revenue growth, as both the welding and electronics businesses battle slower end-market demand, particularly international. For our worldwide welding business, organic revenue declined 1% in Q4, largely due to a 12% decline from our international welding business. Notably, our China welding business, faced by slower end-market conditions in the fourth quarter, continued to transition the business away from the weak shipbuilding end market to focus more and more on oil and gas end markets.","The better news was that our North American welding business produced organic revenue growth of 3% in Q4. Our North American oil and gas customer demand continued to be reasonably solid in the quarter. I will say customer demand from North American heavy equipment OEMs softened a bit in Q4.","And in electronics, our worldwide organic revenues declined 1% in the quarter, and this was based on the fact that our electronics assembly business, which posted a nearly 30% organic growth rate in Q3 due to the new product launch with a key customer -- we saw that business normalized in Q4. As a result, electronics assembly organic revenues declined 1% in Q4 versus the year-ago period.","In our Industrial Packaging segment, our worldwide business continues to essentially reflect industrial production trends in our major geographies. For example, our total North American Industrial Packaging organic revenues grew 1%, while our total international Industrial Packaging organic revenues declined 2% in the quarter. And while our worldwide strapping and equipment organic revenues declined 4% in the quarter, our protective packaging and stretch packaging organic revenues grew 4% and 2%, respectively, in Q4. I should note that our protective packaging business was aided by increased demand from agricultural perishable good customers in Q4.","In the Food Equipment segment, a slowdown in equipment sales was evident in both North America and internationally in Q4. In North America, total Food Equipment organic revenues declined 2%. The equipment portion of this business, which comprises roughly 2\/3 of the portfolio, generated an organic revenue decline of 5%, and this was mainly tied to slower demand for equipment from institutional customers and budget-constrained sectors, such as schools and hospitals.","The North American service business generated organic revenue growth of 4% in Q4. Internationally, institutionally focused equipment sales declined 3%, but service-related organic revenues grew an impressive 8% in the quarter. Clearly, we're very happy with the performance of our service business in the Food Equipment segment.","In our Construction segment, improving end-market demand across North America drove improved results in the quarter. Total North America Construction organic revenues grew 7% in Q4, with residential construction organic revenue growth of 11% leading the way. Driven by improving residential fundamentals around new housing starts and new housing permits, we continue to be optimistic about the longer-term prospects for growth.","In the commercial construction, our renovation construction categories organic revenues grew 6% and 5%, respectively. And again, improving data fundamentals from both Dodge and ABI give us a higher degree of confidence that North American commercial construction should improve in 2013 and beyond.","Internationally, our European construction business continued to face weak end-market demand, while our Australian construction business showed signs of life in Q4. In Europe, organic revenues declined 5% in Q4. But in Asia Pacific, organic revenues actually grew 2%, and this was the first time we produced positive organic growth in this geography in 2012.","A few notes on our Polymers and Fluids segment. Organic revenues continue to be negatively impacted by both weak end-market conditions, as well as product line simplification efforts we continued to carry out throughout the year. Our worldwide polymers and hygiene business was the most impacted during the quarter, with organic revenues declining 9% in Q4. However, as noted earlier, we continued to exit low-margin products and associated customers, which in aggregate helped drive a 320 basis point increase in base margins.","On the fluids side of the business, organic revenues declined 1%, as end-market demand was soft in both North America and the rest of the world.","Finally, moving to our All Other segment. The segment was led by strong organic revenue contributions from our test and measurement, consumer packaging and appliance businesses. For test and measurement, organic revenues increased 3% in Q4, and this was mainly due to strong demand for our Instron structural testing equipment, particularly from customers in Germany, China and Japan.","In consumer packaging, organic revenues grew 2%, due to the growing demand and higher installation of automated case picking solutions from our Vertique global packaging business. And in appliance, organic revenues grew a robust 11% as growth was driven by demand for enhanced screen and safety products in North America, as well as expansion in emerging markets.","Now let me turn the call back over to Ron, who will cover our 2013 earnings forecast. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thanks, John. Before I provide the details of our 2013 forecast, I'd like to walk you through some changes in our segment reporting, which will be effective for 2013. As we discussed at last month's Analyst Day, we're aligning our reporting segments to better match our portfolio segmentation strategy.","So looking at the new 2013 segment reporting structure, I'll start with our former Transportation segment. We'll be transitioning that to a pure automotive OEM segment, with the automotive aftermarket business moving into our Polymers and Fluids segment, as well as the truck remanufacturing and service business moving to our Specialty Products segment.","Given its continued growth, we have pulled test and measurement out of the All Other segment and combined it with the electronics business. This segment represents a core part of our overall growth profile within the company going forward.","The welding business, which was formerly combined with our electronics business, will now be a stand-alone reportable segment. And our former All Other segment has a new name, Specialty Products, which primarily includes our consumer packaging businesses, as well as our appliance businesses and our truck remanufacturing service business. Lastly, we've eliminated the Decorative Surfaces segment, given the divestiture.","In the appendix of our slide presentation, you'll find some detail showing the 2012 revenues for the new segments. And the appendix of last month's Analyst Day presentation includes more detail on our 2013 segments, which is also available on our website. Prior to our April earnings release, we'll provide you a set of restated historical financials for the new segments.","As I mentioned previously, because we retained a 49% interest in the Wilsonart business, the gain on divestiture and ongoing equity income will be reported as income from continuing operations, not discontinued operations, and prior period results will not be restated.","To allow for like-to-like comparisons to 2013, we'll be presenting our 2012 results on a pro forma basis, which exclude the impacts of the Decorative Surfaces business from our 2012 results.","In the first 10 months of 2012 when we owned the business, the Decorative Surfaces business generated $921 million in revenue and $143 million in operating income, which resulted in the $0.21 per share impact. The net gain on the sale of the business and the impact of our ongoing equity interest in the business resulted in $1.30 per share in 2012.","Excluding these items from our 2012 actual results, our pro forma 2012 full year revenue is just over $17 billion. Our 2012 pro forma EPS is $3.76, which represents a growth of 6.8% over a similar pro forma 2011 EPS. The $3.76 will be the 2012 baseline EPS we'll use as a comparison point to our 2013 forecast.","Going forward, we will record 49% of the ongoing net income of the Wilsonart business. Due to the entity's interest expense and amortization expense, we expect our share of the results will have a minimal ongoing P&L impact.","So turning to the forecast. For the full year 2013, our forecasted EPS range for continuing operations is $4.13 to $4.37. This range assumes a total revenue increase of 3% to 5% versus pro forma 2012. The EPS midpoint of $4.25 would be 13% higher than the 2012 pro forma EPS of $3.76 that I just discussed.","Also, as we mentioned in New York last month, we expect increased operating margins next year in the range of 16.5% to 16.9% versus 2012 margins of 15.9%.","The key drivers of our 13% EPS growth for 2013 include the following: $0.41 from the base business, driven from organic growth as well as the net benefits from our initiatives, primarily related to business structure simplification, with some sourcing benefits later in the year; a minimal impact from acquisitions and a $0.02 decline from divestitures, which relate to the smaller divestitures completed in 2012, not the impact of Decorative Surfaces.","We expect to spend between $120 million and $140 million in restructuring, which will be 20% to 40% higher than 2012, resulting in a $0.05 EPS decline. Our nonoperating costs increased, largely due to higher interest expense from the long-term balance we issued last August. We expect currency to have a minimal impact year-over-year as we have assumed exchange rates will hold at current levels.","There's an $0.08 benefit due to the 2013 tax rate forecast of 28.5% to 29.5% versus the actual 30.4% pro forma tax rate in 2012. And we expect to see a $0.12 benefit from the shares we bought back in 2012, as well as what we forecast to buy back in 2013, which we expect to be a minimum of $500 million from our normal free cash flow.","For the first quarter of 2013, we are forecasting diluted income per share from continuing operations to be within a range of $0.91 to $0.99, which assumes a total revenue growth of negative 2% to flat. The midpoint of the Q1 EPS range of $0.95 would be a 4.4% growth versus the 2012 pro forma EPS of $0.91. There's 1 less shipping day in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012, which had a negative impact of 1.5% on revenues and $0.04 per share on EPS. Based on equal days, revenue would be flat year-over-year, with EPS up 9%.","I will now turn it back over to John for the Q&A.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Ron. We'll now open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One, on your 2013 guidance, you talked about the $0.41 help from just your base -- your revenue growth, as well as strategic initiatives, and you sort of mentioned sourcing benefits you'd get in the back half of the year. If you could just give us any color on what's really top line versus what's sourcing or any operational improvements? And then my second question just on the restructuring, you mentioned 20% to 40% higher versus last year. I think at the Analyst Day, you hinted more towards flat to 2012. So what's changed and which segments are they directed towards?","Ronald D. Kropp","Okay. So I'll start with the EPS for 2013. As we've laid out in the slide, there's a $0.41 increase related to the base business, which is where the benefits from the sourcing and business structure simplification initiatives are. That -- so that's based on the 2% base growth as the midpoint of our range. And about half of that benefit, including the negative $0.05 in restructuring, relates to the initiatives. The other half relates to growth and getting operating leverage from that growth.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just on the restructuring question?","Ronald D. Kropp","On the restructuring side, when we had talked in New York, we had thought it'd be flat year-over-year, which was still a significant increase over 2011. As we finalized our 2013 plans and look specifically at our 2013 initiatives around business structure simplification, we got some more specificity around exactly what we need to do during 2013, so we increased the $30 million. It's all related to business structure simplification.","Operator","Next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can we talk about welding in particular? When do you think we'll hit bottom in that China shipbuilding business for your business? And then if you look at the overall business, I think your initial forecast from December was 4% to 6% growth for 2013, organic. You were at negative 1% for 4Q. I know the compares are going to get easier in the international business. So how do you assess that initial '13 forecast and what you saw on 4Q?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I don't think -- we've changed our organic assumption around welding. Again 4% to 6%, could it be at the lower end? Possibly. I think that as it relates to China, clearly, we're going through a transition. We've been going through a transition on the shipbuilding side. It will -- I think it will continue to be -- it will continue to impact some of our results, but we should probably by the end of the year, second quarter, things should start to get better for us in China.","Ronald D. Kropp","And I will point out overall in welding, we had a very strong first quarter last year, almost 20% year-on-year growth, so we have a tough comp in the first quarter, but it gets a little bit easier as we move through the year.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And John, you mentioned that the OEMs softened a bit in welding in North America but still relatively good growth. I mean, do we still look for sort of relatively good growth? I understand the tough comps in 1Q, but generally oil and gas can hold you up in North America. Is that fair?","John L. Brooklier","Yes. I think that's a fair assumption. I mean, if you saw our performance in Q4, up 3%, 4%, largely driven by oil and gas. You saw the report coming out of CAT. So I don't think this is any big news to anybody that their order rates have slowed somewhat. And they're being impacted by some of the global environment, too. So I would expect oil and gas to be a clear contributor to welding in 2013.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So maybe if I can ask just a follow-up on the overall segment, Power Systems and Electronics. Can you tell us how much was the inventory reval in that business versus maybe incremental weakness in the business, in that 300 basis points decline?","Ronald D. Kropp","So in the Power Systems segment, the inventory reval was negative 70 basis points on margin. So the other pieces [ph] of the margin, certainly as we talked about, there's the pension and benefit costs that we record here at corporate that got spread to all the segments; that had an impact of about 100 basis points. On the plus side, price cost was favorable, 80 to 90, and overhead was up a little bit.","Operator","Next question is from Robert Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I wanted to ask one business question. Obviously, the automotive sector is doing great. And I wondered if you could give us any indication of how long that outgrowth versus the market might continue. In other words, it seems as though you've won a lot of content on vehicles, and maybe as the newer vehicles mix in and the older mix out, that continues to be a driver for you for a multiyear period, or maybe it's over. I'm just curious.","John L. Brooklier","No, I think it's a multiyear story.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, this is a business where we obviously have sort of forward visibility. One of the few where we have some pretty significant forward visibility because we are engineering and specifying in new content on models that are 2 or 3 years away from production. So I think this is a pretty solid story for us for a while to come.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So you expect that content win growth above the market to continue for years to come, let's say?","E. Scott Santi","For at least the next 2 or 3 that we can see.","John L. Brooklier","Yes. But I would caution, Rob, as we look at this longer term, I think we -- if you're looking at sort of average penetration numbers, in aggregate, I think we're probably looking at outperformance on a global base, probably 4% to 5%. Now you're going to see some numbers on a quarterly basis that are probably above that. But long term, it's probably more like in the 4% to 5% range.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Great. And then if I can ask just a couple of cleanup questions. There was $0.04 -- you mentioned this in the Investor Day, about $0.04 of corporate nonoperating in the quarter. I'm not sure what that was. And then just the -- in your earnings walk, Slide 19, you have $0.09 of drag from nonoperating. I'm not sure what that is. And then just one last cleanup, in the $3.76 that you're using for a base for next year, what's the 4Q number embedded in that?","Ronald D. Kropp","Okay. So the $0.09 nonop in 2013 versus '12, most of that relates to higher interest expense. We issued some long-term bonds in August of 2012 that will have a full year impact in 2013. What was your first question, sorry?","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","The $0.04 corporate discrete, yes.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. We -- it's mostly pension- and benefit-related cost. The biggest piece of that is additional costs related to the passing of our CEO, David Speer, during the quarter, where we had some acceleration of pension and equity costs related to that.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Understood. And then the 4Q, the embedded 4Q in the $3.76, if that's possible. It just seemed like there was a lower number than the $0.89 embedded.","Ronald D. Kropp","$0.76 is the embedded 4Q number.","Operator","The next question is from Deane Dray of Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just to follow up on that automotive question. The numbers in China were particularly impressive at 28% on base. Maybe frame for us what the builds were within those platforms, and where you stand in terms of your penetration to date in terms of the OEs in China and outlook for the balance of the year?","John L. Brooklier","Yes. I mean, we have -- we've had dramatic overperformance in China. If you look in the last quarter, we were up, as you said, 28% organically, and builds were only up 7% or 8%. So I think it's really fundamentally focusing on those key OEMs, Chery, Brilliance and the like. That's the future of China, and their build continues to be -- while that continues to be strong, our overall performance continues to be very much targeted around our ability to serve those local OEMs that are going to contribute to growth longer-term.","E. Scott Santi","Who are now building cars that are at a much higher level of technical sophistication than they were even 2 or 3 years ago, which certainly helps us in terms of being able to deliver solutions to them that they now need.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then a follow-up question for Scott. Lots and lots of questions about -- and expectations about a resurging U.S. residential cycle. And maybe just give us a sense -- ITW touches so many of those, the products and services within that cycle, and sometimes it's just proportionately attributed to what your overall revenues are. But you still has some really good insight of -- and hopefully you can share for us what you're seeing today for the signs of a recovery and how might this cycle play out differently versus previous cycles.","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think what we are seeing for the first time in this sort of extended recovery, if you want to call it that, is we're starting to see, I think, some real consistent alignment in terms of the overall market metrics that we're looking at across a number of different sources. So I think we are in a stage now where we're starting to build some momentum, and I think the -- in terms of how all this plays out, my view is it's still going to be spiky. It's still going to be -- it's still a high level of foreclosure activity. There are still some, what would you call it, some of the excesses of the prior market issues there are -- that still have to be dealt with as we go through this. But in general, I think we're at a point now, where we're going to start to see some solid year-on-year improvement, and that's going to play out for, as it gets going, for a number of years.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just to clarify, is there the same market exposure, the same distribution channels, the big-box versus a really diverse set of building yards that don't necessarily show up in -- that you would get from big-box indicators? But how is that mix today versus the last cycle for ITW?","E. Scott Santi","Yes. It's a good question. I don't -- I think from an overall channel standpoint, I think the market structure has remained largely intact. I think one of the interesting things that's starting to crop up that certainly is going to have an effect is the issue of shortage of skilled trade labor. We're starting to see now some shortages in terms of various construction trades because a lot of people that used to do that for a living has now -- have now gone out and found other things to do, as this market has been in such a declined state for a while, and so I think we'll see how that ultimately -- it's probably the biggest concern on our radar in terms of macro fundamentals here.","Operator","Next question is from Ann Duignan of JPMC.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Ann from JPMorgan. I haven't changed, again.","John L. Brooklier","We assumed it was JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to take a circle back on the Industrial Packaging business. We always think that, that business as being the most coincident with economic activity. And maybe you could give us some color in terms of what you're seeing now as we go into the new year, post any uncertainty that popped up in the fourth quarter?","John L. Brooklier","Again, I go back to my comment around that I think it -- largely reflecting industrial production metrics, either in North America or in Europe. So the European business is slower, the North American business is a little bit better. Now, we do have disparate pieces of that business around strapping, around protective packaging and around stretch that all have sort of different growth metrics right now. And quarter-to-quarter, those can change based on sort of discrete demand from specific end markets or customers. But I would say in aggregate, what we're seeing there is not dissimilar than what we're seeing from a sort of a total industrial production demand level.","E. Scott Santi","No big changes in Europe over the last 2 quarters. Right.","John L. Brooklier","More of the same on the North American side too, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the process is the same, but the --","Ronald D. Kropp","And we were down in more than industrial production in the fourth quarter, but a lot of that was due to some comps and hedge buys in the prior year. So if you can strip that out, we're really close to flat in the fourth quarter, and that's what we're seeing going forward here.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's good color. And then on Food Equipment, schools and hospitals, no surprise there that the spending might be curtailed a little bit. Do you think that, that was just kind of lack of budgets in 2012 and we might see some pent-up demand in '13? Or are those sectors likely to remain under pressure as we go forward? Just some color on what you're seeing out there in the Food Equipment side.","E. Scott Santi","Yes. I think the budget issues continue going into '13 for those sectors, and that's sort of one of our -- one of the realities of our position, as we've got some real strength in the institutional space, that both in Europe and in North America are obviously dealing with some fiscal pressures and other things. We have been very focused on growing earnings through margin improvement in that business and also focusing on the service part of the business, as I think John talked about earlier, had some nice growth there. So I think that story remains intact for us in 2013.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is that one of the sectors that you might look to build from -- through acquisition?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think it's one that we certainly need to up our penetration in more of the fast-food, fast-casual arena than -- where we said we have a nice position there, but certainly not one that is reflective of, on a relative basis, the overall potential. So whether it's organic or acquisition or some combination thereof, I think we have some -- assume some -- it's been part of our strategy for the last 18 months or so to really position ourselves to have a bigger piece of that part of the market.","Operator","Next question is from John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the elevated restructuring in '13 versus '12, I apologize if you said this, but again, where are you taking these actions? Do you expect the costs to kind of be relatively linearly spent? And is this a new run rate given sort of simplification? Or -- we do expect, from what we know, '14 to kind of revert back to the $100 million.","Ronald D. Kropp","So the $130 million is really being driven by business structure simplification initiative. As we talked about in New York, 2012, 2013 are going to be strong years for restructuring around business structure simplification, and we'd expect that to moderate a bit in 2014, probably not back to normal levels, which are $60 million, $70 million until 2015. But I would say 2013, we'd expect to be a peak. And it's really spread out throughout the year and throughout the company as the business structure simplification is really an initiative company-wide.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So -- I'm sorry. So okay, it sounds like $100 million for '14 is a reasonable midpoint between what you just said for '15 and what you're spending in '13. Where are you -- where have you sort of opportunistically, if you want to think about in that context or whatever, found incremental restructuring opportunities? Is it -- are you just sort of accelerating your process? Or as you're arrived at the new [ph] process and you're saying, \"Oh, we can be doing more of this or that\"? Or -- a little more color would be great.","E. Scott Santi","Yes. John, it basically is coming from the fact that as this BSS, business structure simplification, initiative continues to get sort of developed and executed around the company, our plans for '13 have become much more crisp and clear around what we need to do there. And so essentially, it's about this initiative really accelerating from an execution standpoint for '13.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I'm just trying to understand, though, it's the context that, \"Oh, we really have to,\" I guess, \"spend more money, because we didn't appreciate how,\" let's say, \"difficult the problems were\"? Or that you're getting progress and you're accelerating kind of the plan?","E. Scott Santi","We can get more done in 2013.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. And then just lastly, Scott, it's going to be your first year as CEO. I mean, obviously, simplification is going to be a big part of what, I'm assuming, you're going to be focusing on. What are you going to be -- how are you going to be allocating your time? Is there any way to sort of segment this as you're sort of thinking about your year ahead and what you're hoping to accomplish this year?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I talked about -- as part of my opening comments, the real priorities from my standpoint are pretty simple, which is, we have to execute with excellence in terms of how we run our businesses every day in the context of whatever the realities of the economic environment are. And we are in the process of sort of executing enterprise strategy that we've spent 2 years developing here. So from the standpoint of my time and the management's team and our -- management team's time and our priorities, that's where it resides. So we are in execution mode in a big way in 2013 on our enterprise strategy.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm assuming a disproportionate amount of this is going to be focused on Europe, just based on continued market malaise, your big company in Europe. I mean, I'm just -- I'm assuming that you're going to be spending more time physically in Europe with your European managers figuring out how to drive incremental productivity and so forth.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think those plans are pretty far advanced in terms of all the planning around business structure simplification and -- in Europe. I think the -- I wouldn't characterize the benefits to the company as disproportionate to Europe. I think Europe is a big part of it. But ultimately, from the standpoint of -- you know, this is not necessarily economic in its -- sort of motivation. This is about structuring the company in a way where we can leverage scale and yet maintain our decentralized operating model. So this is a global initiative. We're applying this in both North America and in Europe. And certainly, the economic environment in Europe has an added element to it. But by and large, the processes are very similar in North America and Europe. The execution is a little more challenging in Europe, as I'm sure you well know, given just some of the realities there but doesn't in any way take away from the potential benefits for the company in the end.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I was also thinking from the potential of the profit improvement. I'm assuming that you would probably have more European margin improvement opportunity than you would in other parts of the company. Maybe that's not a fair statement.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I wouldn't necessarily -- I would say there are equal benefits in both.","Operator","The next question is from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The -- a question going back to the Power Systems and Electronics, the 300 basis point segment margin decrease. If I take out the inventory revaluation and the pension hit you described earlier, everything else appeared to drive around the 90 basis point decrease in margins, if I'm doing the math right. That's still a relatively high decremental. Was that -- aside from the price cost stuff you already described, was that primarily driven by the mix shift related to the various OEM actions? And how far are your customers saying those are going to last into 2013?","Ronald D. Kropp","Well, I think the biggest piece of that remaining amount that I didn't talk about earlier is, there's a 50 basis point hit related to restructuring in that segment, which is really more focused on the electronics business versus welding. So we don't see any significant difference in margins between -- in the product mix area coming through this quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. So that, okay, should reverse through the year. On -- then on this automotive aftermarket product line loss, a few cleanup questions, I guess. Is that related -- is that contained within the acquired revenues from SOPUS? What drove the customer decision? Was it price or something else? And then does that have a material impact on the '13 revenue outlook?","E. Scott Santi","It is related to SOPUS. It was related to -- how do I want to describe it? I think, ultimately, a pricing situation that we weren't comfortable pursuing from a profitability standpoint. And from an overall 2013 impact, it certainly had some impact from a revenue standpoint. But from a -- we've got -- have had some strong margin improvement momentum within the -- what's now our aftermarket platform, and we expect that to continue in '13, with or without the revenue that we just talked about.","Operator","The next question is from Eli Lustgarten of Longbow.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Just got one cleanup question. The tax rate is going down in '13 to a new midpoint of 29%. Is that mostly the R&D tax credit? Or is that the level we should look out for 2014, whether or not they have an R&D tax credit or not?","Ronald D. Kropp","No, and I think we've got the R&D tax credit baked in at both years. I think the -- our normal run rate for our tax rate has been 29%. It ticked up a little bit in the fourth quarter, which got us the 30.4% for the year, but we'd expect our normal run rate, similar to what it was in the earlier quarters of 2012, to be 29%. So no significant change in our tax profile.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So '14, it would be -- you should assume the same as '13?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. We're not going to predict '14 tax rate at this point, but that's certainly a reasonable assumption.","E. Scott Santi","Or 2015, Eli.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, I was just -- just wanted to make sure whether this is a permanent change or not.","Ronald D. Kropp","Not today.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","In the 0.5 point to almost 1 point improvement in operating margins, could you give us some idea as you look at the new segments that, will most of that come in a couple of segments? Or is it pretty well spread? And could you give us some idea of the operating margin improvement expected for 2013?","Ronald D. Kropp","It's really across most segments. And as we said, these enterprise initiatives are touching all the segments, and that's certainly been a large part of the margin improvement.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So there's no 1 or 2 segments that's going to have above average -- or, what was it? Above average? Would it be average? Or, I mean, is there any guidance...","Ronald D. Kropp","Not anything of significance.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So it's pretty well distributed. And just a cleanup, do you have an auto forecast in North America, Europe and China and a housing forecast?","John L. Brooklier","Yes. Eli, I'll go offline with you, and give you all of those numbers.","Operator","Next question is from Ajay of FBR.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So maybe just on that inventory reval, and I know you do this on a periodic basis, but sounds like it came a little bit heavier this quarter. So is it possible to kind of just provide general color in what that was? Is it more related to raw material pricing? Or is it more accounting on work in process or finished goods? Just general color would be helpful.","Ronald D. Kropp","So what it is, is certainly, we do look at our inventory costing as we move through the year on a quarterly basis. But generally as we move into -- through the end of the year, there's a normal process of looking at our standard cost based on current cost, as well as going forward. And if you look at where the impact of that standard to standard, it's really in the businesses that use steel as a primary raw material input. So it's automotive. It's Power Systems. It's Construction. So as you know, steel has been going down all year, so it's really -- you really had to catch up in some of the adds that we recorded in the fourth quarter.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. But if we can maybe look at 2013, so your organic revenue guide -- and I know you provided color at the analyst meeting by segment. But just any updated thoughts on the new segments. What are your expectations that you're baking in to that full year guide? Which segments coming in better than average, which kind of flagging?","John L. Brooklier","Well, if you remember, when we presented this in New York, we did present it in the context of the new segments. So the segments that have higher-than-average growth in that were automotive OEM, which we've talked about, and welding. Those are the 2 bigger segments that are driving the higher growth.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Good. And not to violate your 2-question policy, but -- so I'm looking at this $0.09 hit nonoperating, and you mentioned interest expense in the bonds. But then you also have this nearly $3 billion in cash overseas, which I'm presuming is not yielding much return. So what's the game plan? I mean, is it just you wait for a tax policy change? You have this big cash sitting outside; what do you do with that?","Ronald D. Kropp","That's a good question, and it's something that we certainly are focused on. The way the tax policy works now, it would be significantly expensive to bring that back to the U.S. But certainly, we could do that, if we needed to do that. Right now, what we've been doing is using that cash for overseas investment. So we've had a lot of growth in Asia and China, for instance, through greenfield builds; in Brazil, through acquisitions. So that's certainly where we're using that overseas cash. But where we're at now and especially given all the discussions around U.S. tax policy, right now, there's no plans to bring any of that back until all that gets sorted out. And certainly, we'll evaluate that as the tax policy gets finalized.","Operator","The next question is from Joel Tiss of BMO.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So here's my list of 11 questions. So just 2 quick ones on acquisitions. You didn't really give us any kind of a target level, and I know it's being deemphasized. But can you just give us a sort of a ballpark of where things look like that might be shaking out?","E. Scott Santi","I think what I would say is, from my standpoint, Joel, for 2013 -- not a big focus for us. We've got a lot of things to get implemented and executed. We will certainly take a look at good opportunities as they come to us. And so we're certainly not ruling acquisitions out. But from an overall priority and focus standpoint for 2013, probably not high up on the priority list. That being said, we had about $500 million of acquired revenues in '12, maybe something close to that, maybe something less.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then the growth of 200 basis points organic growth, 200 basis points better than industrial production. Is that going to start later after the businesses get realigned? Or is that something that's going to start right away?","John L. Brooklier","Well, part of it relates to the portfolio mix, so we are -- we have businesses inside the company today, a number of them, significant ones that are -- have historically performed over the last 5 years at that level or above. We have some others that have, given the sort of characteristics of their markets, been working the other way. So some of the sort of aggregate performance of the enterprise is a function of how we're going to shape the portfolio over the next couple of years. And I think as a result of that, a higher growth portfolio is going to yield us the overall metric that we're talking about. So yes...","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Probably more '14 and beyond?","John L. Brooklier","'14, '15 and beyond; heading up to that, yes.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, everybody, for joining us on today's call. I know it's a busy day for everyone. I look forward -- we look forward to hearing from you again, and I'll be talking to a number of you later in the day.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Karen Fletcher","Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's First Quarter 2019 Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi, along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss first quarter financial results and provide an update on our 2019 full year outlook.","Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the remainder of the year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","So let's turn to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.","Scott Santi","Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and the first quarter played out about as expected with EPS of $1.81, coming in modestly above the midpoint of our guidance. The ITW team continued to execute well on the things within our control, delivering 100 basis points of benefits from Enterprise Initiatives and an operating margin of 24.3%, excluding 70 basis points of margin impact due to accelerated restructuring investments. ","We delivered 27.7% after-tax return on invested capital and a 21% increase in free cash flow. Sales started out a little slow across the board in January before picking up the pace in February and March. Organic revenue was down 1.5% or flat excluding the impact of one less shipping day in the quarter. Our auto OEM sales declined 6% as auto production in North America, Europe and China was down a combined 8%. That being said, we are seeing some signs of stabilization in Europe and China auto markets and expect to see some modest improvement in the back half of the year. The 6% decline in auto OEM revenues reduced our Q1 organic growth rate by 1.5% at the enterprise level. One less shipping day was another 1.5% and PLS was 70 basis points as expected. ","As we discussed on the last call, we had a pretty heavy restructuring agenda in Q1 as we accelerated our 2019 plans into the first quarter, a significant portion of which was directed at our auto OEM business in Europe in order to adjust our costs to current demand levels. As we also discussed on our January call, we knew that the first quarter and, in fact, the first half had some challenges in terms of year-on-year comparisons: the currency translation, accelerated restructuring, a slightly higher tax rate, one less shipping day, tougher organic growth comps and auto production declines in Europe and China. And that these challenges would dissipate and the operating environment would be much more favorable in the back half of the year.","Coming out of Q1, things are playing out largely as we anticipated. We are executing well on our long-term enterprise strategy and on our 2019 operating plan. And as a result, we remain firmly on track to deliver on our full year EPS and margin improvement guidance.","I'll now turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with some additional detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. Over to you, Michael.","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. GAAP EPS of $1.81 came in above our guidance midpoint of $1.78. As expected, year-over-year EPS headwinds included $0.07 of foreign currency impact, $0.06 of higher restructuring costs and $0.03 of higher tax rate, which combined for $0.16 unfavorable EPS impact in the quarter. Excluding these headwinds, Q1 EPS would have been $1.97, an increase of 4% over last year. It is important to note that we expect these specific headwinds to significantly moderate as the year progresses. More on that later in my remarks.","In addition, as we mentioned on the last call, Q1 also had 1 less shipping day, which was approximately $0.03 to $0.04 unfavorable impact to EPS and 1.5 percentage point reduction to organic growth. As a reminder, we get that shipping day back in Q3. Organic revenue for the quarter was down 1.5%, below our guidance due to the slower start in January and flat on an equal day basis. Sales trends improved in February and March as March organic revenue was up 2% year-over-year on an equal day basis. In line with our expectations, PLS impact related to 80\/20 activities was 70 basis points this quarter.","Operating margin of 23.6% improved 20 basis points, excluding 70 basis points of accelerated restructuring impact. Once again, strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives contributed 100 basis points. Another bright spot was stronger pricing and moderating raw material inflation, which resulted in better-than-expected price\/cost margin impact in Q1. Cash flow performance was also a highlight as free cash flow increased 21% with a conversion rate of 90%, which is seasonally strong for the first quarter. Return on invested capital was 27.7% and finally, we repurchased $375 million of our shares as planned. As Scott said, the ITW team executed really well on the things within our control and other than the slow start in January, this was a pretty solid quarter for ITW. ","Moving to Slide 4 for some detail on operating margin. Overall, 23.6% operating margin in Q1 as I mentioned. And on the bottom left of the slide, we laid out the positive price\/cost trends that I just referenced. Strong pricing across all segments more than offset moderating raw material costs on a dollar basis, resulting in improving price\/cost dynamics in Q1 and going forward.","On the right side, Enterprise Initiatives continue to be our most significant and most consistent contributor to margin performance. Our 80\/20 initiatives and Strategic Sourcing efforts combined for 100 basis points of margin improvement. And that impact is broad-based. In the quarter, Enterprise Initiatives benefits ranged from 70 to 130 basis points across each of our seven segments. ","This quarter, revenues were down, resulting in 30 basis points of negative volume leverage, only 10 basis points of margin dilution from price\/cost, which was our best performance since the fourth quarter 2016 and 40 basis points of other, which is primarily related to employee costs, specifically our typical annual salary and wage increases. Going forward, we expect to return to our normal run rate of 10 to 30 basis points for this line item in the remaining quarters of 2019.","This brings us to net 20 basis points of margin expansion before adding the impact of 70 basis points from restructuring, which considering the negative volume impact this quarter, is pretty solid performance. Even with the higher restructuring, operating margin was strong at 23.6% and the good news is that we have significantly more runway for improvement as the year progresses and over the next few years as we shared at our Investor Day in December.","Please turn to Slide 5 for details on segment performance. The table on the left summarizes organic growth both as reported and normalized on an equal days basis. As you can see, six segments had flat to positive organic revenue growth on a worldwide basis despite the slower start to the year, with automotive OEM the only segment that declined due to the decline in automotive production this quarter.","On a geographic basis, North America organic revenue was up 1% while international was down 1%. For the year, we're expecting low single-digit growth in all major regions based on current run rates and our risk-adjusted view of auto build forecasts. On that point, IHS forecasts combined auto build growth for North America, Europe and China to be plus 4% in the second half. Our risk-adjusted view puts those combined builds flat for the second half, 4 points lower, which is the scenario embedded in our annual guidance. More on that a little later in my remarks.","This brings us to the right side of the slide on Automotive OEM segment results. Overall, organic revenue was down 6%. IHS data for Q1 build rates in North America, Europe and China combined saw the decline of 8% in the quarter in what remains a pretty dynamic industry environment. That said, there's some optimism in the industry and amongst our teams on the ground that builds would bottom out in the first half. Again, looking at North America, Europe and China combined, IHS projects auto production to be down 6% in the first half, followed by 4% growth in the second half. And as I just mentioned, our current guidance reflects an assumption of only 1 -- flat growth in auto production, no growth in auto production in the back half of the year.","Our North American business was down 6% with Detroit 3 production down significantly. As expected, in the quarter, builds were also down in Europe and China. In Europe, the implementation of the WLTP emissions testing procedures last year continues to cause some auto production disruption although this situation seems to be normalizing. And in China, auto retail sales were down double digits in the quarter.","Automotive operating margin declined 350 basis points this quarter. As planned, restructuring related to our adjusting cost structure in Europe and EF&C acquisition integration reduced margins by 190 basis points. Despite the fact that we're beginning to trend positive on price in this segment and actually getting positive price in the first quarter, price\/cost reduced margins by 110 basis points.","Just stepping back for a minute from some of these near-term challenges in the auto market. Our new program wins remain strong as does our new product pipeline. Our annual new program win targets equate to 2% to 3% of above-market organic growth, and we have met or exceeded those targets for each of the last three years and expect to do so again in 2019. Overall, we have a strong and focused business operating in a well-defined, highly value-added niche in the auto market. And we deliver a ton of value to our customers in serving that niche as reflected in both our level of profitability and in our organic growth rate over the last five years.","As you all know, this is an industry that's going through significant change, and in our view, the trends and changes that will play out in the auto industry over the next decade or so only add to the significant future profitable growth potential that ITW has in this space. There's no question that we're in a challenging point in time with regard to the auto market, and we are taking the appropriate steps to adjust our cost structure accordingly. ","In fact, we're performing quite well in the current auto downcycle as reflected in our ability to maintain auto OEM segment operating margins well above 28% despite a meaningful year-over-year revenue decline over the past two quarters. We will continue to manage our way through these near-term demand challenges, but our primary focus remains on acting and investing to position ITW to take full advantage of the significant long-term profitable growth potential that we have ahead of us in our niche of the auto market.","Moving on to Slide 6. Food Equipment organic growth was up 3% on an equal days basis, which follows the best quarter in four years. You will recall that Q4 organic growth was up 5%. In North America, organic growth was 2% with equipment flat and service up a strong 4%. Growth in independent restaurants and QSR was solid, partially offset by a decline in institutional, where we had a tough comp of 10% growth in the prior year quarter. Food retail was a bright spot, up double digit and we're encouraged to see a sequential recovery taking shape there.","Overall, current run rates, coupled with new product introductions, support our view that sales trends will improve from here as the year progresses. With respect to international markets, Europe grew mid-single digits, primarily on strong performance in our ware wash division. Operating margin was almost 25% with Enterprise Initiatives and volume leverage offsetting the impact from restructuring activity in this segment.","Test & Measurement and Electronics had a solid quarter with organic revenue up 1% on an equal days basis against a tough comp of 8% organic growth in the prior year. As expected, Test & Measurement was down 2% on lower sales to semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Excluding semiconductor, Test & Measurement was up 5%. Electronics was up 1% with strong sales in equipment assembly and contamination control, partially offset by a decline in electronic components where we had a 9% growth comp last year. Operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 24.1% with Enterprise Initiative benefits, the main driver.","On to Slide 7. Welding had a solid quarter despite the fact that organic growth was off to a slow start in January, in part as our main operations in Wisconsin was shut down for two days due to weather. Welding ended up 5% on an equal day basis against a tough comp of 8% last year. As you can see on this slide, organic growth was fairly consistent across-the-board with equipment and consumables both up in the 3% to 4% range. North America industrial was up 3% against a comp last year of 15% and Commercial was up 5%. International growth was particularly strong in China, up more than 20% while Oil & Gas was essentially flat. Based on current run rates, we continue to expect organic growth of 3% to 6% this year against a tough 2018 comp of 10%. Operating margin was 28.1%, up 40 basis points in the quarter.","Polymers & Fluids organic growth was up 1% on an equal days basis. As we talked about on the last call, we expected auto aftermarket to be down following strong 7% growth in the fourth quarter driven by new product launch. Polymers was up 2% while Fluids was up 1% and operating margin expanded 40 basis points in this segment as well.","Turning to Slide 8. Construction organic revenue was flat on an equal days basis. North America was down 3% due primarily to a tough comp with Q1 last year, up 7%. Residential remodel sales were essentially flat while new construction was impacted by softness in U.S. housing starts. Commercial construction was down 4%. Recent sales trends support our view here that we expect sales to improve going forward as comparisons ease and new products are introduced. Europe grew a strong 5% with robust demand across-the-board. Australia and New Zealand sales were down 6% similar to the fourth quarter with some continued softness in the economy.","Specialty organic growth was flat on an equal days basis with solid organic growth of 6% in the equipment businesses offset by softness and consumables. Specifically, a few division internationally including graphics and appliances. Overall, international is down 6% and North America grew 2%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 26.5%.","Moving on to Slide 9 and an update on 2019 guidance. As you saw this morning, we are reiterating our full year EPS guidance range of $7.90 to $8.20, which represents 4% to 8% growth year-over-year. We now expect organic growth in the range of 0.5% to 2.5%, given the slow start in January. Our guidance is based on current demand run rates and a risk-adjusted second half forecast for auto builds as we talked about. This compares to prior guidance for organic growth of 1% to 3%. And other than the slow start to the year, our outlook for organic growth through the rest of the year is essentially unchanged.","As we talked about on the last call, we fully expected going into 2019 that the first half of the year was going to be more challenging for a number of specific reasons as many of these challenges would dissipate such as the operating environment will be more favorable in the back half of the year. As Scott mentioned, this dynamic is pretty much as expected, and our current view of the year is pretty much in line with the organic revenue guidance ranges by segment and the EPS bridge that we provided on our last call. Because the first half of 2019 will be a little more challenging than what is typical for us in terms of year-over-year comparisons, I'll spend a minute describing how we expect some of these challenges to play out as the year progresses. ","On Slide 3, we sized the EPS impact in Q1 from foreign currency translation impact, restructuring costs and tax rate for a total of $0.16 year-over-year. For Q2, we expect currency impact at current rates of about $0.06 and higher restructuring activity of about $0.03 for a total of $0.09 in Q2, which adds up to about $0.25 per share for the first half of 2019. These 3 items are still headwinds year-over-year in the second half but only to the tune of $0.05 to $0.10. In other words, we expect to see an improvement to second half EPS of $0.15 to $0.20 versus the first half on currency, restructuring and tax. ","Now let's talk about organic growth. First, in terms of sales comparisons year-over-year, we have one more challenging organic growth comparison ahead of us in Q2 and then comps get significantly easier in the second half. Second, there's one extra shipping day in the third quarter, which as I mentioned, adds 1.5 percentage points to our Q3 organic growth rate. Third, auto builds for the combined regions, North America, Europe and China, are expected to improve significantly in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, IHS forecasts builds in these combined regions will be up 4% and our guidance has risk-adjusted this down to builds being flat. Therefore, based on current run rates, easier comps, the extra shipping day and our risk-adjusted view of auto builds, we expect organic growth in the second half will be in the range of 3% to 4%. ","Finally, on the margin side, we talked about much improved price\/cost dynamics with stronger pricing and more favorable raw material costs. At this point, price\/cost margin impact is essentially neutral, and on a dollar basis, price remains significantly higher than the raw material costs. In addition, we expect that restructuring benefits related to the projects that we accelerated into the first half will start to give benefits in the second half of the year. The average payback on the projects that we approved in the first half are less than a year, and the savings projected for the second half on these projects are expected to be in the $25 million to $30 million range.","The most significant and consistent driver of margin improvement remains the Enterprise Initiatives where we have clear line of sights to projects and activities that support at least 100 basis points of improvement every quarter going forward and for the full year. And as I said earlier, we're off to a strong start in free cash flow and expect conversion above 100% of net income for the year. And as you know, we've allocated $1.5 billion to share repurchases in 2019.","Before I wrap up my prepared comments, just a few words on our portfolio management activities. Overall, we're on track to complete some of [indiscernible] of our planned divestitures in 2019, pending Board approval. Given the quality of these ITW businesses, we're seeing solid interest and attractive valuations.","As we complete the project schedule for 2019, they will trigger some pretty significant gains on sale and cash proceeds, all of which are excluded from our current guidance. As we have stated before, the divestiture of these long-term growth challenge divisions, when completed by the end of 2020, are expected to be accretive, favorable to our overall organic growth rate and margins in the tune of 0.5 point of organic growth and 100 basis points of margin expansion. And as a reminder, we're committing to making sure that these divestitures are EPS-neutral, and we plan to offset any EPS dilution with incremental share repurchases above the $1.5 billion in our plan today.","In summary, as we have for the past 6-plus years, we delivered on our quality commitments despite some near-term challenges that we continue to expect will dissipate in the back half of the year. Overall, we're set up for a stronger second half in terms of delivering solid organic growth with best-in-class margins and returns, accelerating earnings growth and strong free cash flows.","With that, Karen, back to you.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. Thanks, Michael. We're going to open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Cheryl, back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Scott or Mike, I think you mentioned international being down 1%. What was Europe specifically? In last quarter, you mentioned basically you're just seeing some isolated weakness in Europe mostly in auto. Is that still what you're seeing in Europe and what do you expect for the year there?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, in Europe, the biggest -- so Europe overall was down 2%. As you point out, the biggest decline by far was the automotive OEM business. If you take that out, we're actually positive in Europe. We're seeing some pretty good performance. I mentioned Construction Products, up 5%; Food Equipment, up 4% and like I said, the biggest delta was really the automotive business.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just stepping back. I mean, we like to follow your CapEx-driven businesses like Test & Measurement, ex-Semicon and Welding, they do seem to be hanging there well and you mentioned some improvement in March sales. Did these businesses generally just sort of do well throughout the quarter? Do you have good visibility you think still in the sort of core Test & Measurement and Welding businesses as you move forward?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, I think we saw pretty consistently across-the-board a slower start to the year as we talked about in January. But from there on, Welding, Test & Measurement, Food Equipment really improved in February and March and are on track to deliver on the organic growth guidance that we provided on the last call. So Food Equipment, up 3% to 5% for the year; Test & Measurement, tough comp, up 1% to 3%; and Semicon is a 2-percentage-point drag. As you know, we risk-adjusted our Semicon exposure and hopefully we have a pretty conservative view for Test & Measurement. Welding, up 10% last year. We expect to be up 3% to 6% this year. So the CapEx businesses, as you pointed out, are performing well. I'd add maybe to that from a pricing standpoint, that's also the case.","Scott Santi","I think the only thing I would add is they are -- to your visibility question, Andy, these are book-and-ship businesses, so these are not long lead time businesses. So we are certainly seeing pretty steady performance right now. But these are not businesses where we have long lead times associated with them. So conditions on the ground right now seems to be up hanging in there pretty well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","[Technical Difficulty]. First half versus second half? And I know that in the Q, we'll get more information around price\/cost. But...","Scott Santi","Joe, we were cut off, I think, from the starting part of your question. Can you back up from the beginning, please?","Joseph Ritchie","Yes, sure. Sure, no problem. I'll start by again saying good morning. And so -- and so I said that Michael had provided some really good color on the first half, second half. And I was getting to my question which was really around price\/cost and I know that this will come in the Q. But maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color around where you're seeing price\/cost, what you saw in the segments this quarter and then how you see that progressing? Are there certain segments that are going to be better than others as we progress through 2019?","Michael Larsen","I'd say across-the-board, Joe, we saw positive price in all segments, including, for the first time in a while, in the automotive business. So pricing was slightly ahead of our expectations for Q1. And similarly on the cost side, we talked about last year moderating raw material costs. That certainly played out in Q1. And so last year, if you recall, total price\/cost was 50 basis points of margin impact even though we're certainly positive on a dollar basis. We just did 10 basis points here of negative margin impact in Q1. And these cost dynamic -- price\/cost dynamics are trending positive for the balance of the year. ","In terms of by segment, I would just point out, I mean, auto, as you know, even though positive on price, it can be a little challenging. It takes a little longer as we talked about before to get price there. But really, all the other segments across the board really strong pricing performance.","Scott Santi","And maybe the other color I would add is essentially what the environment we are seeing across the board is moderating raw material cost inflation and the impact of prior price moves ultimately continue to play out in terms of the year-over-year comps. So there's always a lag between the costs and the pricing response. And so it's -- given the things continue to stay stable from input cost standpoint, we are picking up some added benefit on the price side. And that's what I think what we saw in Q1 and sitting here to-date, what we would expect to see through the balance of the year.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just two real quick clarifications. Michael, you talked about flat auto builds as your assumption in the second half of the year. Is there still an outgrowth assumption embedded in your forecast? And then the second quick question clarification was really around corporate. That number was lower than we expected this quarter. How should we think about that than for the rest of the year?","Michael Larsen","Can you just repeat the second part, Joe?","Joseph Ritchie","Yes, the second one was around was...","Michael Larsen","The second question.","Joseph Ritchie","Yes, the corporate number was lower than we expected this quarter.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think that's a pretty good -- I would take -- on the corporate side, our corporate costs are pretty much flat year-over-year on an annual basis. It can move around a little bit on a quarterly basis, but I would probably model last year. For the auto question, yes, there is -- for the full year, we're expecting, as we talked about, 2 to 3 percentage points of auto outgrowth, maybe at the lower end of that range here for the second half, just again trying to be a little bit more conservative in a pretty dynamic environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen Volkmann","So Michael, lots of discussion around sort of first half, second half but I noticed you guys didn't provide sort of a specific guide on the second quarter. And the streets got you sort of flattish, I guess, for the next three quarters. And I guess I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a little more detail you wanted to provide around that.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think Q2 will look, in terms of organic growth, pretty similar to what we just reported for Q1. I think we do have the shipping day issue goes away in Q2 but this -- the first half is going to be, as we expected, pretty challenging. And so I guess that's the color that I will provide on Q2 and the first half.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up on Test & Measurement. Looks like semiconductor was really sort of what dragged that down. What are you hearing or seeing relative to semiconductor as we go forward?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So really no change to our view. We have, just as a reminder, about $200 million of Semicon exposure. The assumptions that we built into the plan this year was that to -- for that to be down double digits and we've not changed that view. But like you, we've certainly heard some of the more positive commentary from industry experts and customers as it relates to the back half of the year, but we have not adjusted anything in our guidance for Semicon. And so like I said, hopefully, that, that will turn out just like auto to be a fairly conservative view.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","I guess two questions. The comments that you made about things improving in March, you feel like that's consistent with what we've heard from other industrial companies. Can you just speak to what geographies or segments sort of that was most pronounced in, I guess, is what I would say? ","And then just my second question on the guide, I know you're taking organic growth down a little and you talked about the shipping days, your EPS -- but your margin expansion of 100 bps is still the same. Just on the like low organic growth, what's -- how do we still get the same margin improvement on sort of somewhat low organic growth would change quarter-to-quarter?","Michael Larsen","Yes, Jamie, you can do the math yourself and 0.5 point of organic growth in terms of EPS impact is in that mid- to high single-digit EPS impact, and the biggest driver kind of working the other way is the price\/cost dynamic that we talked about. It really offsets that plus a couple of other puts and takes. But then it's really improved -- improving price\/cost dynamics is why we are holding EPS guidance for the full year despite the lower organic growth. And then to your first question, this February, March dynamic vibe, that was pretty broad-based all segments. And if you look at the major geographies, we really saw the same dynamics in terms of a slower start to the year and then sequential improvements in February and March above our typical seasonality. So that's certainly encouraging and that's how it played out in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just a couple for me. First, just on the trajectory into Q2. Given that it sounds like you exited March a bit better and we're not going to be talking about government shutdown or weather and everything else that was rolling on, why wouldn't you expect some acceleration in the organic growth rate in the second quarter relative to what you printed here today?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think, Jeff, it's -- the comp is a little bit tougher. I believe we were up 4% in Q2 last year and so certainly, your points are valid. It's just the comp is a little bit more difficult in Q2.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just to clarify on the restructuring, Michael. The $0.09 in the first half, that's just the gross cost of the restructuring or is there some net benefit from the actions already kind of showing up in that number?","Michael Larsen","That's just the gross number. And that is -- it is the increase year-over-year in restructuring costs. And so I think we -- year-over-year, $0.10 is the higher restructuring cost, and of that, $0.09 are really in the first half of the year.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay, got it. And then just on back to price\/cost. Are you able to continue to push price higher now in this environment or this is more about kind of analyzing the steps you've made and trying to kind of hold onto it maybe as costs start to slip the other way?","Michael Larsen","Yes, this is -- I think the big effort was around offsetting raw material costs, including tariff impact and we've essentially done that at this point and we're entering into a more normal pricing environment on a go-forward basis. Certainly, we benefit from the fact, as Scott said, that there was a lag last year. We've kind of -- we've neutralized that and we are trending in a more positive direction. But we also don't expect, to answer your question, that there was going to be price reductions. We will be able to hold on to what we have implemented so far, and we're just benefiting here in the near term from the raw material costs being a little bit better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO.","Joel Tiss","I wonder if, can you just -- I don't know if you mentioned this or not but the PLS for the year, I know you're jamming a lot into the first half. Is it going to be pretty much done? Or are there more things that you can pull out in the second half if you need to?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, it's really not a number that we manage at the -- it's sort of...","Scott Santi","Certainly, manage over the time.","Michael Larsen","It's more an outcome of the hundreds of activities and projects going on across the company. And so it was 70 basis points in the first quarter and our view for the year has not changed at 80 basis points.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And is it too early to frame for us the kind of earnings dilution you might get from divesting those seven underperforming businesses?","Michael Larsen","Well, we're not going to get the -- I mean, we are going to get some -- these businesses are profitable businesses. And so there are some earnings going away, but we'll more than -- the plan is to make that neutral by offsetting any earnings dilution by incremental share repurchases above the $1.5 billion that is in the plan.","Scott Santi","$1.5 billion.","Michael Larsen","$1.5 billion. Did I say $1.5 million? $1.5 billion that's in the plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo.","Andrew Casey","Just wanted to -- the cadence that you talked about, the slow January getting better through March and you mentioned it was pretty broad-based geographically. Could you -- and Jeff kind of touched on some of this in his question. Can you kind of talk about what you were hearing for the reasons behind that in the U.S. and then also for international markets?","Michael Larsen","Yes. I mean, Jeff mentioned a few of them. I mean, I think it's difficult to quantify things like weather, for example. But we do know that our operations in Wisconsin in our Welding business were closed down for two days and you can -- that's certainly had an impact. But beyond that, it's really difficult too.","Scott Santi","I would say there's sort of obvious promise it would have been if this was -- would have been isolated to North America or U.S., it was weather and the government shutdown. The fact that it was pretty consistent in our international business was certainly surprising. And to be honest with you, I don't think we've heard any great answers or theories necessarily other than it was certainly there as a factor seems to have moderated as we move through the quarter. But it was a really -- it's called an interesting early part of the quarter this year.","Andrew Casey","And then for auto, the EF&C acquisition integration, it seemed to accelerate a little bit from what you can see in the fourth quarter. Is that a correct read and how do you long do you expect that to persist as a headwind to margins?","Michael Larsen","I would -- these were -- these were planned activities just as we put together the acquisition integration plans. I think if anything, they were planned for this year and we moved them forward by a couple of quarters. But those were activities that were planned all along.","Scott Santi","We're pretty focused in Europe, so some of the acceleration is -- although as Michael said, they were planned, some of the acceleration is really around in response to the dip in production rates in Europe. And in addition to that, some other restructuring in our core auto businesses in Europe. But the normal integration process, Andy, is typically 3 to 5 years, so these are essentially normal going forward with EF&C. And so certainly would expect that slowdown in another year or so in terms of specific restructuring around EF&C.","Andrew Casey","Just a follow-up on that. Should we pretty much expect the sort of a headwind through this year or should it dissipate as the year goes along?","Michael Larsen","The bulk of the restructuring -- 75% of our restructuring this year will be done in the first half of the year. So there's going to be a benefit when you look at the second half relative to the first half when we get to the second of the year.","Scott Santi","In terms of less year-to-year headwind and also in terms of benefits from the investment...","Michael Larsen","Right, there's two dynamics here. That's a good point. I mean, there's lower restructuring costs in the second half of the year and you're starting to see the benefits from the projects that we are executing right now and that we've approved for the first half of the year and quantified that at $25 million to $30 million. So $0.05 to $0.06 a share of benefit here in the second half relative to the first half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird.","Mircea Dobre","My question is on Food Equipment starting there. So frankly, this was a little bit slower than what I anticipated in terms of your organic growth in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you can provide a little more color here. I understand you mentioned a tough comp in institutional but at least looking back through the data that I've got, it looked to me like from an overall segment perspective, Q1 was really your easiest comp in Food Equipment. And I guess what I'm wondering here, as the comparisons gets tougher as the year progresses, how do you think about growth here and what's happening in front?","Michael Larsen","It's tough to hear what you were saying, Mig. But I'll do my -- the volume was a little low. But I think Food Equipment, similar to the other segments we talked about, a little bit of a slower start but then picked up good momentum in February and March up 3% equal days after up 5% in Q4. I think in North America, what's encouraging is the restaurant side, and QSR was growing in the mid- to high single digits. Food retail was up significantly year-over-year, which is the grocery stores. And then the challenge was really some comps on the institutional side. And so those are -- those can be bigger projects that move around, were up 10% on the institutional side last year. ","And so like we said, with current run rates, we've got some new products coming in, anecdotally, quoting activity, backlog, order activity all points to a pretty solid year here with 3% to 5% growth. And like I said, new products, retail is improving, Europe's pretty strong and looking good for the rest of the year. So we're pretty confident with our...","Scott Santi","And the service business growing by the best quote, that is growing 4% to 5%.","Michael Larsen","Yes, service up 4%, it was certainly encouraging. So we're on track here, Mig. It would be our current view.","Mircea Dobre","Okay, okay. I appreciate that. Then switching to Welding. So you mentioned a couple of missed shipping days in Q1. I'm presuming this is, I don't know, as much as 300 basis points worth of growth to that segment. When do you expect to make those up? Is that lost business? Or do you just make it up in subsequent quarters? And of course, comps are getting tougher here as well, especially on a two year stacked basis. Do you think there's enough momentum in this market to allow you to really hit kind of this 3% to 6% guidance?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, the short answer is yes, we do. We are on track for 3% to 6% organic growth. It's really hard to quantify, of the two days the operation were closed down, how much did we get back in Q1, how much we're going to get back in Q2. I think when we look at -- broad-based, this is still pretty solid. If you look at the equipment up 3%, consumables up 4%, industrial business was up 3% against the tough comp, Commercial was up 5%, national is really good. China up 20%, we don't talk much about that and then Oil & Gas slowed a little bit. But I think some of that, you can maybe point to the rental business specifically and weather, if you want to. But we feel good about the outlook also in Welding for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","My questions have been answered, but maybe a little bit more of a deep dive into Construction Products, both U.S. and international, just some commentary on what you're seeing in those markets.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think I sound like a broken record here, but this was a little bit of a slower start. North America was down, which is not typical. We did have a tough comp last year. The residential remodel side is still pretty solid, I think into the big box, kind of retail channel very good. Commercial was down 4%. That can move around a little bit and has kind of been flattish over the years. I'd say we certainly saw a pickup here in February, March, which is encouraging. We got some new products coming in our cordless technology that's going to get rolled out this year across all geographies. Europe really good, up 5%. And then Australia and New Zealand, as expected, down 6%, just like we did last year in the fourth quarter. And I think there, that's really more of a macro economy than anything else. So...","Ann Duignan","Okay. And maybe some commentary on North America resi, we're seeing a slowdown in housing. Are you seeing any reacceleration and any color there on the housing side?","Michael Larsen","There was a little bit of that in Q1. It's -- residential remodel overall was flat. The remodel side is positive, new housing -- new residential is a little slower. But I don't think there's a big macro commentary hear from us. I think we feel pretty good looking into Q2 and the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","So I know a lot of the questions have already been asked here. But -- and apologize if I missed this one around inventory destocking. We heard from 3M last hour that they saw a pretty good amount of destocking in auto, which I would imagine most of your exposure is more just-in-time. But just trying to get a sense for across the portfolio, anything you saw on a 4Q pre-buy or a 1Q destock that might not make 1Q look quite as slow as what it appears on the page?","Scott Santi","I would say in the auto space certainly, as production drops, there is a bit of a compounding effect in terms of inventory at the tiers and even at the OEMs, so -- right? I know that I would call it sort of intentional destocking other than what I would describe it as, from our perspective, it would be just normalizing inventory levels based on lower production rates. But certainly, it's got some compounding effect beyond just the drop in actual end product production. So certainly, in auto, when you talk about declines in the high single digits, some of that was a factor, there's no doubt, in our organic sales in Q1 as well. Beyond that, I'm not aware of any pre-buy or any significant other actions in any of our other segments related to that.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. And do you have any kind of above-normal price increase on Jan 1 that might have supported that even if it wasn't obvious to see that people would've looked at? Or is the pricing calendar was a little different?","Scott Santi","From a pricing standpoint, we certainly had price increases in across our 87 divisions, there are certainly pricing actions that were -- that took place in Q4 and in early Q1. I can't say that any of it was so concentrated on January 1 that it wouldn't have had a big impact if were caused a, let's call it, a material pre-buy at the enterprise level anywhere. But at the division level, I'm sure there's was some puts and takes related to that.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I would just add to that, I mean, the pricing activities have really been going on across the company for the last 6 to 9 months as we've worked to offset the raw material cost inflation. And so I would agree with Scott, we don't think anything unusual here, January 1.","Operator","And our next question comes from Walt Liptak from Seaport.","Walter Liptak","Just a couple of follow-ups that I can go through real quick. One, just to clarify, which segments are getting the restructuring?","Michael Larsen","So if you look at the first half spend here, close to half of it is directed at auto automotive segment that we talked about. And the balance is really our typical kind of 80\/20 front-to-back activities and it's pretty well suited across the segments. I think if you do the math, Construction, Specialty Products, Food Equipment, kind of in that order would be -- but it's pretty broad-based.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. And then the divestiture, I may have missed this but the timing of it is in the second quarter that we should expect those?","Michael Larsen","So I think I more second half would be a realistic view. I think there's quite a bit of work that goes into getting these divestitures done. And so I think we expect second half of the year would expect the first ones to come through.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher","You guys have done a very good job of being able to maintain your EPS despite the organic challenges in recent quarters or years. So I'm just curious if you stress tested that ability. I mean, we can do our own math on buybacks, but it seems like you may have called out some pricing strategies here. Just curious how much organic growth reduction you could phase in and still maintain your EPS guidance. So for example, if we would have to take another point out for the year if the second half didn't really come through. Kind of is that a level of which you could still hold your guidance?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think -- I would guess I'd just point to our track record over the last six years that we've done, I think, a pretty good job giving a realistic view of what the year might look like. And then we've executed really well to do better than that and I think we expect to be able to continue to do that.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up to Mig's question on Welding. Are you anticipating that the organic growth would hit at or near the top end of the 3% to 6% range in the second half? And if so, is that China continuing that strong double-digit pace? Is it oil improving? How are you thinking about that?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So as I think for Welding specifically, we are -- like we said, we are comfortable with the 3% to 6% for the year. We have a challenging comp here again in Q2. It gets a little easier in Q4. But beyond that, I can't really give you quarterly numbers for the Welding business in the second half.","Karen Fletcher","We're near the end of the hour. How about we take one more question and end the call.","Operator","Our final question will be from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","Just one question on March. Is there any possibility that March is benefiting from the shift in Easter from March to April this year? And I guess maybe a way to talk about that is how is the strength you've seen in March continued into the early weeks of April?","Michael Larsen","Yes. I mean, I don't have a really good answer to your question other than we saw sequentially better sales trends in February and in March than what we see historically in April, everything appears to be on track as we sit here today.","Nicole DeBlase","And then on the price\/cost impacts, if we kind of think about how costs are expected to wash through the year, if we assume that there's no major change in input costs from this point, kind of like flat and then the spot rate, is it possible that price\/cost turns into a tailwind for you guys by the back half?","Michael Larsen","Yes, that is a possibility. If -- and this -- I mean, a little bit, Nicole, because things are pretty dynamic, right, still. And so on the cost side, there's still the tariff dynamic, who knows...","Scott Santi","And if you lock the cost right now.","Michael Larsen","To answer your question, no, it's based on cost where they are today and where price is. Mathematically, it should turn positive in the back half of the year from a margin standpoint.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. So with that, we'll end the call on the hour. I know you guys have a busy day today and I'm happy to take any follow-up questions afterwards. So thanks for joining us.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to John Brooklier. You may begin.","John L. Brooklier","Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's second quarter 2012 conference call. As is our normal practice, our CEO, David Speer; and CFO, Ron Kropp, have joined me to discuss our Q2 financial results, as well as update us on our longer-term strategic initiatives.","Here's a quick agenda for today's call. David will shortly provide a brief update on our ongoing long-term initiatives, as well as second quarter highlights and commentary on our second half forecast. Ron will cover our Q2 financial results in more detail. I will then talk about our Q2 geographic performance and segment results. Ron will then come back and provide a detailed update on our Q3 and full year forecast. Finally, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] As normal, we have scheduled 1 hour for today's call.","This presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2012 third quarter and full year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 10-K for 2011 for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations.","Moving to next slide. Let me remind everybody that our telephone replay for this conference call is (888) 566-0396. The playback number will be available through midnight of August 7. Now let me turn the call over to David, who has some brief introductory comments. David?","David B. Speer","Thank you, John. Before I comment on our strong second quarter results, let me update you on our 3 long-term initiatives that we introduced to you all last quarter. To remind you, our 3 key areas of focus going forward are: business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and portfolio management.","We continue to make good progress in all 3 categories. For business simplification, we've been actively developing and communicating our plans to key internal and external constituents. Internally, a host of our businesses have reviewed and are in the midst of announcing organizational changes to support our larger revenue base businesses, consolidated organizational structure where appropriate and focused on similar customers and end markets, while maintaining the intimate customer market interfaces critical to our innovation initiatives and business agility.","In strategic sourcing, we have made key decisions regarding the sourcing approach in organization, as well as identified the first and second phase of direct and indirect sourcing activities. As to portfolio management, part of our strategic planning process is the identification of noncore businesses that no longer fit our long-range plans, a number of which could likely be divested in the future, as we have done been recently with the finishing businesses and 2 consumer packaging businesses.","We will continue to develop and implement these plans as we move forward. As promised, we intend to provide some enterprise-wide data by December that will begin to quantify the financial impact of these initiatives over the next several years.","Now let's move to our second quarter results. We were very pleased with our strong second quarter operating performance despite end markets slowing in a variety of international end markets and the significant currency headwinds we faced in the quarter. Thanks our differentiated 80\/20 operational focus, our business has produced very strong operating margin improvement in the second quarter due to excellent management of input and overhead costs. We also continued to return significant levels of cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, as well as our strong dividend payout.","Looking ahead to the second half, 2012. We lowered our EPS forecast range, given the ongoing negative impact of currency translation and the expected continuing sluggish demand in the international end markets, as well as additional restructuring expenditures that will now total over $100 million for the year. Ron will cover our forecast in more detail later in the call.","Now let me hand it over to Ron, who will talk about the strong second quarter performance. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Here are the highlights for the second quarter. Revenues increased 0.9% due to higher base and acquisition revenues, offset by the unfavorable impact from currency. Operating income was $770 million, which was higher than last year by $59 million, representing income growth of 8%. Operating margins of 16.5% were 110 basis points higher compared to last year. Diluted income per share from continuing operations was $1.11, which was close to the midpoint of our range. Finally, free operating cash flow was $409 million for the quarter.","Now let's go to the components of our operating results. Our 0.9% revenue increase was primarily due to the following factors. Base revenues were up 2.3%, with North American base revenues increasing 5.3% and mixed international base revenues that overall were down slightly year-over-year. John will discuss the geographic mix in more detail later in the call. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 3% to revenue growth, and currency translation decreased revenues by 4.5%, largely due to a weaker euro.","Operating margins for the first quarter of 16.5% were 110 basis points higher than Q2 2011. Base margins increased 150 basis points with higher sales volume contributing 60 basis points. The positive impact of non-volume items increased base margins by 90 basis points versus last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of price cost favorability. In addition, margins were lower by 40 basis points due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The net operating margins from acquisitions, excluding amortization and other acquisition accounting, were 14.4% for the quarter.","Overall, despite uneven market demand, we had a strong second quarter earnings performance, reflecting our decentralized operating model, which allowed us to react quickly to market conditions, as well as our established 80\/20 operating discipline.","Looking at working capital and cash flow. Accounts receivable DSO of 61 days was lower than last year and inventory months on hand declined to 1.8 months. ROIC for the second quarter was 16.3%, which was 70 basis points higher than Q2 of last year. Our ROIC continues to run at our 15% to 17% target range, which is significantly above our cost of capital.","The second quarter cash provided from operating activities was $509 million with capital expenditures of $100 million, resulting in free operating cash flow of $409 million, which was $184 million better than Q2 of the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $648 million in free operating cash flow, and we expect to generate close to $2 billion in free operating cash flow for full year 2012.","Turning to capital structure. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be as follows. Our first priority is organic investments, especially related to our key growth platforms and emerging markets. Examples of organic investments include R&D spending for new product innovation, additional investments in manufacturing capacity and restructuring projects which have long-term margin benefits.","Our next capital priority is dividends. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $172 million, and our current dividend yield is almost 3%. Any excess capital after organic investments and dividends are used for external investments, either share repurchases or acquisitions. We evaluate allocation between these external investments based on the best risk-adjusted returns.","During Q2, we continued our robust share buyback activity with $526 million in repurchases, which brings us to $1 billion in share repurchases through first half of 2012. As of the end of Q2, we have approximately $2.9 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under our buyback program. In the first half of 2012, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, during the quarter, we utilized $106 million for acquisitions, over 80% of which continues to focus on our growth platforms and emerging markets.","Our debt levels increased $141 million during the quarter, with our debt-to-capital ratio at 33% and our debt-to-EBITDA remaining at 1.4x. Our cash balance overseas is $1.7 billion, and we have plenty of debt capacity to make additional investments.","I will now turn it back over to John, who will provide more details on the operating results.","John L. Brooklier","Thank you, Ron. Before I get to the actual segment results, let me take just a moment to review our Q2 geographic trends. Our total revenue growth excluding currency impact was 5% in Q2, with organic revenues growing approximately 2% versus the year-ago period.","And our Q2 results were similar geographically to Q1. North America businesses delivered relatively strong performance in Q2, producing organic revenue growth of 5%. Overall, international organic revenues were down modestly in the quarter. Europe's organic revenues declined roughly 2% and Asia Pacific's organic revenue growth of 2%, while it grew 2%, it still lagged our expectations. And that's mainly due to China's flat organic revenue performance in Q2. Moving to South America, organic revenue declined 4%, and that was largely driven by softness in the Brazilian economy.","Now let's move to our segment results. And as previously noted, total company organic revenues increased roughly 2% in the quarter. The biggest organic growth contributors were produced by our Power Systems and Electronics, Transportation and businesses in our All Other segment. Nearly all of our segments contributed to operating margin improvement of the 110 basis points Ron talked about earlier. And notably, we saw the most operating margin improvements in our Food Equipment, Decorative Surfaces and Industrial Packaging segments.","Now move to the next slide. And let's do a -- let's drill down deeper into our segments. Please remember that our Transportation segment largely consists of our auto OEM businesses, with smaller revenue contributions from our auto aftermarket and truck remanufacturing businesses.","Total segment revenue -- organic revenues grew 3.4% in the quarter versus the year-ago period. In our flagship auto OEM business, again, that was a key contributor to organic growth, with worldwide organic revenues increasing 6%. Notably, our North American organic revenues increased 8% and Asia Pacific grew 24%, thanks to our growing presence with Chinese auto OEMs. Our most notable example of strong product penetration was in Europe, where organic revenues grew 1% even as auto builds declined 7% in Q2 on a year-over-year basis.","Moving to auto aftermarket, organic revenues fell 2% as consumer spending slowed in Europe and China, which resulted in negative organic revenue performance in those areas. In North America, the auto aftermarket business produced modest organic revenue growth as discretionary consumer spending continued to be soft. And finally, in our truck remanufacturing business, organic revenues grew 4%, largely due to strong energy development activity in Canada and Western United States and the need for our retrofitted specialty trucks.","In our Power Systems and Electronics segment, we continue to see very strong demand from our welding customers, while our electronics businesses saw real improvement in the equipment and assembly side of the business. Total segment organic revenues increased 5.2% versus the year-ago period.","In welding, our worldwide organic revenues grew 9%, with North America organic revenues increasing 11% and international organic revenues growing 2%. While our Q2 organic numbers were down from our -- what I'll call our red-hot and unsustainable Q1 performance levels, they still represent very solid growth metrics. We continue to see relatively strong demand from global equipment manufacturers who serve end markets such as oil and gas, mining and agriculture.","In electronics, the story was one of improvement, as noted earlier. Worldwide organic revenues for electronics increased 2% in the quarter, with electronics equipment assembly growing 14% due to strong order rates from key electronics customers. Organic revenues for our other component businesses, what we'll call all other in the electronics piece, declined 5% as consumer demand for basic cell phones and computers was weaker.","Let's move to our Industrial Packaging segment. Our businesses once again essentially reflected industrial production trends in the major geographies. Our North American performance was stronger and the rest of the world was weaker. Segment organic revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. In aggregate, our total North American Industrial Packaging organic revenues grew 4%, while our total international Industrial Packaging organic revenues declined 2%.","In our bellwether Signode steel and plastic strap and equipment businesses that provide end-of-the-line packaging for finished goods, worldwide organic revenues declined 1% in Q2. And by geography, international organic revenues declined 4%, while North American organic revenues grew 3%.","And finally, in our stretch packaging business, trends were better. Worldwide organic revenues grew 3% in Q2 largely based on better equipment sales.","Moving to Food Equipment. It was once again a tale of 2 geographies, with North America outperforming the international businesses. Segment organic revenues increased a little bit over 1% in the quarter.","In North America, organic revenues were up 3%, with equipment sales increasing at a similar level. Equipment sales benefited from an uptick in demand for cooking and slicing products to private sector accounts, including casual dining restaurants and supermarkets. Institutional accounts, such as government, schools and hospitals, continue to be constrained by limited budgets. On the service side, organic revenues grew 2% as the service organization continued to focus on key customers.","Internationally, total organic revenues were flat in Q2 as strength in sales to Asian-based customers in Japan, China and Thailand was offset by the weakness in France and Italy. In particular, businesses associated with cooking products for both institutional and government-related customers remained weak in the quarter.","Moving to our Construction segment, the decline in demand in Europe and Asia Pacific was enough to offset the better end-market metrics associated with the North American recovery in the residential and renovation construction categories. As a result, segment organic revenues declined about 0.5% in the quarter.","Internationally, organic revenues declined 4% in the quarter as Europe and Asia Pacific organic revenues fell 6% and 1%, respectively. In Europe, which was the hardest hit, Construction end markets were hit by a lack of spending by both private and public sector customers, especially in the commercial construction category. For example, accordingly to EUROCONSTRUCT, commercial starts declined 23% in Q2. In Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand experienced modest improvement in the residential construction category compared to prior quarters.","Now the better news was in North America, as organic revenues increased 8% as the residential, commercial and renovation categories were all positive in the quarter. Residential construction organic revenues grew 13%, while both commercial and renovation construction organic revenues increased 5%. For residential construction, we continue to be more optimistic about additional recovery in housing starts in 2013 and beyond, based on the most recent NAHB housing start numbers of 760,000 units.","Moving to our Polymers and Fluids segment, organic revenues were essentially flat as North America produced positive organic revenue growth, while internationally, our European, Asia Pacific and Latin American businesses all experienced and had to deal with slowing end-market demand.","In our polymers and hygiene category, organic revenues were flat in the quarter. And that's due to positive organic revenues resulting from China transportation and appliance market, as well as the North American military industrial, and MRO markets were offset by slowing market activity in Europe and Brazil. In our fluids category, organic revenues declined roughly 1%. And this again was due to Europe offsetting revenue gains from our businesses in North America, Russia and India.","In our Decorative Surfaces segment, we generated very strong organic revenue performance from businesses in a variety of geographies. Segment organic revenues grew approximately 5% in the quarter.","In North America, our Wilsonart high-pressure laminate business produced very solid organic revenue growth of 6% due to ongoing product innovations largely targeted to commercial construction-related customers. Notably, Wilsonart continues to be an industry leader through its premium, high-definition, higher-price-point product that simulates natural stone.","And internationally, our Decorative Surfaces businesses generated organic revenue growth of 4%. In Europe, both our U.K. and French business contributed to organic growth. And in Asia Pacific, China grew organic revenues mid-single-digits. So all in all, very good performance by the segment.","Finally, in our All Other segment, we had positive organic revenue growth contributions from both our test and measurement, as well as our appliance, businesses. Segment organic revenues grew 2.6% in the quarter.","As noted, test and measurement organic revenues grew a strong 8% in Q2 due to still reasonable CapEx spending for structural testing equipment in North America, Europe and China. Instron's ElectroPuls environmentally-friendly equipment continued to have strong market acceptance in the quarter.","In the appliance category, organic revenues grew 3% mainly due to key energy efficiency programs with major North American customers, such as Whirlpool.","The only downside on the major categories in this segment was in consumer packaging, where organic revenues declined 1%. And that was largely due to ongoing softness from key multipack beverage customers in North America and Europe. Our decorating businesses produced strong organic revenue growth in Q2.","So this concludes my remarks on the segments. And I'll now turn the call over to Ron, who'll talk about the 2012 forecast. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thanks, John. The third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting diluted income per share and continuing operations to be within the range of $1.03 to $1.11. This range assumes total revenue growth of negative 1% to plus 1%, largely related to currency, as well as softening international end-market conditions. The midpoint of Q2 diluted EPS range would represent a growth of 7% versus last year.","For the full year 2012, our forecasted total revenue growth is now between 1% to 3%, which is lower than our April forecasted midpoint by 400 basis points. Our forecasted EPS range for continuing operations is now $4.03 to $4.19. The EPS midpoint of $4.11 would be 10% higher than 2011, excluding the Q1 2011 tax benefit related to the Australian tax matter.","This EPS benefit is $0.15 lower than our forecast from April and is driven by an $0.08 reduction from lower base business revenues, largely due to slower international end-market demand, as well as a 7% impact due to expected declines from weaker foreign currencies. An increase in expected restructuring costs took away $0.02 but was more than offset by a $0.04 benefit from year-to-date and forecasted share repurchases.","I will now turn it back over to John for the Q&A.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Ron. We'll now open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could comment, please, on the acquisition pipeline, given what's going on in the global economy here. Is it sort of less likely that we're going to get things over the goal line over the next few quarters and whatever other commentary you might have in that regard?","David B. Speer","Well, Steve, I think I would characterize the acquisition activity, as -- from our standpoint, entering the year, we viewed this as a year that we're going to be challenged from a valuation metric standpoint. And that certainly has been the case. Those properties that are out there that we're interested in have had fairly high expectations in terms of valuation. That hasn't stopped us from continuing our work in those categories. But I would say, the way I would describe the acquisition environment for us right now is it's modest. We have included through Q2, I believe, about $500 million in acquired revenues and don't expect the second half to be significantly more boisterous, if you will, than what we've seen because I think valuations are the primary concern. In terms of getting things done, I think the early -- any of those that have significant European or Asia Pacific concentration require a fair amount of due diligence at the moment to really determine their go-forward positions in those geographies, and obviously, factoring in the weakness that those geographies have seen this year. But I don't think it will have a major impact on us closing deals that we have agreed upon. But I do think the market environment for us will remain challenging from a valuation metric standpoint. And that's probably our primary issue, rather than being able to look at specific geographic concerns.","Ronald D. Kropp","And I will add that we are targeting our strategic growth areas for acquisitions. As an example, we talked about last quarter, we acquired in the first quarter Brooks Instrument in our test and measurement segment, which is $200-million-plus in acquired revenues.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. But, David, just to clarify, do you think you can get to anything like $500 million done in the second half? That sounds like a stretch to me.","David B. Speer","Oh, no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that, no. No, I wouldn't be able to predict the second half number at the moment. I mean, just looking at the pipeline, there's a lot of what ifs in that pipeline that are not fully qualified at the moment. So no, I would not suggest we could do $500 million in the second half. I mean, it's not impossible, but certainly not what I would call likely at the moment based on what we see in the pipeline.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's what I thought. And then just on the other side of this, as a follow-up quickly, I mean, the dec surfaces business has been for sale at some point. Other people think maybe it's on the shortlist now. But, boy, a strong performance from that business. And I'm wondering if that sort of changed your view of how that fits into the portfolio.","David B. Speer","From a strategic standpoint, we've maintained our position on dec surfaces since 2008, when we had made the decision then that we didn't think long-term it would fit our portfolio in terms of long-term growth opportunities. But I would tell you that they have performed very well in terms of operating characteristics along the way. They did better during the 2008, 2009 downturn than most businesses and they clearly are doing quite well this year. But strategically, it hasn't changed my view of the long-term fit of that business in our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMC.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you give us a little bit more color on the restructuring charges, on the $100 million? To the best of your ability at this point, where might that spend be most used? Is it on the strategic sourcing? Is it in one particular business? Just a little bit of color on where that money is going be spent.","David B. Speer","Well, I'll give you high-level flavor, and then Ron may have more detail to add. But I would say that the bulk of this is based on additional restructuring based on the weakness we've seen more internationally and more European as a result. There is some of that, that is based on a view of our business simplification, but not a lot. Most of it so far is based on reacting to the slower market conditions internationally, particularly in Europe. So it's obviously a step-up and a way of us getting ahead of what we think are some continuing weakening conditions that we want to be able to address. And, Ann, as you know, the ability to do that in some of the international markets has much more -- much longer impact to get the result, particularly in Europe. So we've tried to stay on top of these things and push them forward as we look at the weakness or the underlying performance in some of these market segments. But I would say that using that wonderful 80\/20 term we like to use, 80% of this is focused on existing businesses and maybe 20% is focused on the combination of looking at what structural changes we're looking at making, along with some of the strategic sourcing initiatives.","Ronald D. Kropp","The segments that have a bigger restructuring spend this year in the first half of the year has been Construction, especially in Europe. In the second half of the year, the Polymers and Fluids segment will have a bigger restructuring spend. You mentioned strategic sourcing. That -- any costs, additional costs or investments there to do the sourcing initiatives is not part of restructuring. That would just be additional headcount or consulting costs, et cetera.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's great color. And actually, that leads me to my follow-up question, which I think, David, you probably just answered. And that is, given how well the Construction business has held up in Europe despite the starts that you talked about, and the Industrial Packaging business, are you seeing further weakness in those businesses as we speak? Is that what's led to the restructuring? And should we anticipate an accelerated decline in those businesses in the back half?","David B. Speer","No. I think as I tried to point out, it takes longer to initiate these. So there's a lot more planning that goes into the implementation of those. So many of these restructuring projects have been in the planning stages for several quarters and are just at the front end of implementation. So it's really a question of trying to stay on top of what we see as longer-term trends there. So I think we've done a good job of managing the cost portfolio there. But at some point, when you look at the market conditions and you project forward, you begin to get into the tougher, longer-term issues that restructuring brings, which is a lot of headcount, and some cases, facilities. So those take longer to implement. So it's more a question of timing, I would say, Ann, than any difference of view of how we see those markets at the moment. I do expect European construction, as John pointed out in his comments, that it's going to remain a tough environment for some time. A lot of it is based on government spending. And as we know, what's going on in Europe, there's a lot of rationalization of where the government is going to spend their money. And I think Construction will continue to have a cloud over in Europe for some time until it becomes more clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a general question on sentiment as you continue to work through the process of identifying where you can streamline, cost save, et cetera. How are your managers dealing with it? Have you had any employee turnover start ahead of it? And I mean, your margins are pretty good. I don't know whether this is getting people to be more engaged. So if you could just comment, David, on how the organization is adapting to the process.","David B. Speer","Sure. Well, let me separate that into 2 pieces, and I'll actually answer your second piece first. I think the margin performance is really not due to any advance move, if you will, on some of that. I think the margin performance -- as we recognized going into the year, this is going to be a challenging environment, and as we didn't see the kind of revenue growth that we'd expected, that we were going to have some ability to react. And so we put in place, I think, some strong cost control programs at the beginning of the year and we also counted on some significant improvement in our price cost, which we have been chasing, as you may recall, Rob, for a couple of years. And we were able to achieve that as well. So the strong operating margins, I think, are a result of the detailed planning controls that we put in place at the end of the year, which allowed us in the quarter to get a 16.5% return and some great incrementals as we experienced much weaker revenue performance than we thought, headwinds in currency and so forth. So that was independent of any of the work we've done in business simplification. I would say in the business simplification area, anytime you talk about consolidation, you talk about a change in structure, you get people concerned. At this stage, we really have not lost any significant number of people. And I think people have embraced the fact that this starts with looking at the strategic approach and looking at how we streamline our structure to be reflective of where we see our growth opportunities. And we're doing this in a rational fashion, and the operating managers are heavily participating in every step of this along the way. So we're not dictating from the corporate office that these 5 units should be combined into 1. These are the operating people. They're looking at what makes sense given the new economic environment, given the global nature of a number of our end markets and customers, and let's march through this in a logical fashion. And we're not going to make wholesale decisions that would impact their ability to serve their customers and markets. So I think given the level of change, which always brings with it some level of angst, we've done a good job of managing that and involving our key managers. And so I would say that as we approach the end of the year, we'll be in a better position to quantify some of what that will mean and we'll be able to give some examples. And you'll see, I think, the levels of involvement and participation will help us ultimately come up with the right solution and with the right metrics that we can maintain going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. One, in terms of price cost, you called out what it was in the quarter. I just want to get a sense of the benefit that you're assuming in the back half of the year and whether you're seeing any pricing pressure from your customers. And then my second question, just to follow-up on, I guess, M&A and divestitures. One, do you anticipate -- if the macro continues to decline and valuations come in, as we look out to 2013, I mean, is there a chance that you shift your focus more towards trying to do some bigger deals to take advantage of the market? And then I guess, my other question is, I guess, I'd be concerned how easy it will be to get divestitures done in this market, given the performance of your businesses and just prices people are willing to pay.","David B. Speer","I'll let Ron talk to price cost, and then I'll come back and talk a little bit about acquisition and divestitures.","Ronald D. Kropp","So as I said earlier, we had a pickup in margins of 60 basis points from price cost. That was better than the first quarter, which was 40. And really, that was driven mostly by raw material cost going down as opposed to prices going up. We've still been able to hold on to price increases that we put in place towards the end of last year in response to cost increases in most of our segments. But costs have come down significantly, especially in the resin area, which has been bouncing all around during the year. For instance, recycled PET was down 37% in the quarter, but it was up 48% last quarter. Steel was also down but to less of an extreme. So we see raw material cost continue to go down a little bit as we move through the rest of the year. So we'll continue to see a benefit, price\/cost, probably a little bit higher in the third quarter than it was this quarter, but about 60 basis points for the whole year if things hold where we expect.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And that's versus the 30 to 40 you were expecting before, right, I think.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, yes.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Sorry. And then sorry, David, on the acquisitions and divestitures?","David B. Speer","Yes. Let me comment on acquisitions first. As I commented earlier, I think the environment has been one where valuations, frankly, in the first half of the year have been more challenging than I would've thought, given the market conditions. So I don't see that really changing. We have a number of nice target opportunities that we think fit strategically. The question will be, do they fit with us from a valuation standpoint? It's too early to answer some of that, but...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But if you did see the valuations more compelling, would you be more aggressive again on the M&A front?","David B. Speer","Absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, there are several assets that we're looking at that, given the right circumstances, we will clearly be more aggressive. No question.","Ronald D. Kropp","Especially in those areas that we've identified as strategic growth areas or emerging markets.","David B. Speer","Yes. So I -- it's hard to predict, as you know, acquisition activity because these are competitive processes. They involve buyers whose expectations change during the process. So part of our caution in not putting numbers out as we may have in the past is that the environment has changed a lot. It's hard to predict. Our hit rate in our pipeline used to be 60% to 70%. And for the last 2 years, it's been well under 50%, so hard to predict. It could be in the pipeline, but for me to be able to predict whether we can actually close it is a lot more difficult than it used be.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But are you -- on the divestiture front, are you concerned you're not going to get the price, I mean, that you should given the performance of your businesses in this type of market?","David B. Speer","No. I'm not concerned at all because we aren't going to sell if we don't get the right price. Because most of these are businesses that make good margins and make contributions the company, so there's no point in rushing to a sale. These are not fire sales. So if the metrics work properly for us in terms of what we think are reasonable prices, then we'll transact. If they don't, we won't. And we've walked away from proposals in the past we've had on assets that have been held for sale that we haven't transacted. And some of them have come back, one of them being a consumer packaging business that we sold earlier in the second quarter. So if the price isn't right, there's no reason for us to transact. I mean, that's part of our evaluation process, is really, what are the minimum price that we should be targeting? And what, given the market conditions, is the ideal price? And we generally end up somewhere in between those 2, but rarely would we be in a fire sale situation, where we have to transact. As you know, from our balance sheet, we've got strong operating cash flow. We don't need the cash at any particular moment in time as a result of divesting something, so we could be patient.","Ronald D. Kropp","And we've seen it's a pretty reasonable market for divestitures. Strategics are still looking for acquisitions and private equity has a lot of capital that they're looking to put to work as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you talk about the visibility you have into your welding business? It's obviously been the highlight of your global business, I think, for the last couple of quarters. What are the major OEMs telling you? Sometimes we get questions about how long can construction and ag, with the drought, hold up, and mining. What are you guys seeing?","David B. Speer","Well, we don't have lots of visibility. Our typical visibility is for the order book that we get from those types of customers, which is not a lengthy order book. On the equipment side, our order book runs in the 2- to 4-week category, not 3 or 4 months, so we don't have great forward visibility. The consumable side is probably even a little bit less than that, so I can't say we've got great visibility. But when we talk to those customers, particularly in the mining category, oil and gas, and even the ag category, we continue to get reasonable forecasts in terms of forward demand. And as I think Ron pointed out or John in his comments earlier, we had a barn burning first quarter. We had a very good second quarter but not nearly as good as the first quarter. And we could not have predicted either one of those in advance of what we actually achieved because the increase in demand from our customers occurred during the quarter, not before. So we're well positioned with those customers, but I can't say we've got any particularly good forward visibility.","John L. Brooklier","Yes. I would just add, Andy, that if you remember, to David's point, that first quarter, our organic revenue for welding was in the high-teens. This quarter, it was more like 9%. But I think we're looking on a go-forward basis at numbers that are high single-digits as opposed to something that's double-digit.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, John. Just looking at global construction, there's obviously a lot of moving pieces here. I mean, we understand the European weakness. It was interesting, your comments on Asia maybe getting a little bit better. You've talked about Australia in the past. I guess, my question is, how much can U.S. residential improvement help offset European weakness? And how do we look at this? I know it's a balanced business. So how do we look at the balancing act that's going on here between improvement in North America, maybe Australia stabilizing and Europe getting a little bit weaker? How do you look at it?","David B. Speer","Well, first of all, let's look at the statistics. We've been on a 5-year dramatic decline in North America, to the point where 70% of our revenues in Construction now are international. So there's not enough size in the market, no matter what the housing start numbers look like in the near-term or project activity [ph] on commercial, in North America to offset major declines in Europe, where -- Europe represents 50% of the business today. So I think unlikely we're going to see that offset. I would say, long-term, that what we see emerging here in the U.S. will be very favorable obviously to our Construction business. We're not as wrapped up here in government financing in construction as they are in Europe and even in obviously Asia Pacific, particularly in China. So how these governments decide to finance construction going forward as part of their overall rationalization of their fiscal policies is going be an important determinant in how those markets recover. But the U.S. markets aren't big enough to cover for any significant decline in the European or Asia Pacific markets.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's fair. But have you seen stabilization in Asia Pacific? I think you kind of alluded to it earlier. How is that region for you?","David B. Speer","I think John's comments were Asia Pacific but largely in Australia, which represents about 70% of our Asia Pacific Construction business. So China, I would say, continues to -- it's going to depend on, in my view, in China, more what they determine they're going to do with the infrastructure spending there over the course of the next several years, as to how that plays out. They have been aggressive in the past. The question is how aggressive they're going be in the future. But as you know, most of the major construction activity in China is financed by the government.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Some questions on base business. Can you comment on the progression in the quarter versus expectations? It looks like, overall, you came in below the low end of your range. But how did the months play out?","David B. Speer","There was no particular trend. I think if you look at things on an equalized day basis and you look at things on a seasonality basis, no particular...","Ronald D. Kropp","It's very uneven. It was -- June was stronger than May. April was stronger than May. May was weaker.","John L. Brooklier","We clearly didn't see any deceleration -- big deceleration in June, Deane, which probably, I think, a lot of people would've expected. So I think the numbers, to David and Ron's point, the numbers are very, very uneven. And we're heading into a quarter right now, into the third quarter, where numbers coming out of Europe are going to be not only what's going on with end-market demand, but they're always typically all over the place in the summer.","David B. Speer","The seasonality in Europe in third quarter is obviously a wildcard on top of what already is a weak market, so -- but no, I wouldn't say we saw any particular trends in Q2 that we could highlight.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then how about what's embedded on base business for third quarter for the range, as well as for the year?","David B. Speer","Third quarter range is revenue -- base revenue growth of minus 1% to plus 1%.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that's total revenue.","David B. Speer","That's total, yes.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But what's the base?","Ronald D. Kropp","The base is in the 2.5% to 3% range.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Positive?","David B. Speer","Yes. So obviously, the big vertical...","John L. Brooklier","There's a plus in front of that number.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just checking. And then how about for the year?","David B. Speer","The big variable in Q3 will be again currency.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And then for the base business for the year, the updated guidance?","Ronald D. Kropp","2% to 3%.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. And just -- and then last one for me, other income came in higher as a benefit. Was there any one-timer in there, any adjustment? And can you just flesh that out, please?","Ronald D. Kropp","We had a few one-timers, the biggest one being a sale of a building.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so how much -- so were there other gains in there?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. There was a gain of about $6 million. That was the biggest item.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walt Liptak from Barrington Research.","Walter S. Liptak - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I just wanted a quick follow-on to Deane's question about -- I wondered what your Europe assumptions were for the third quarter and for the full year. It's down 1% -- 1.5% organic. It's obviously negative but not as bad as I would've thought.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. What we're seeing by region is pretty similar to what we saw in the second quarter, where North America is going be stronger; Europe is going to be down 1% to 2%; Asia Pacific, flat to plus 1%. So pretty similar demand rates from a base side from what we saw in the second quarter.","David B. Speer","We don't really have a catalyst, Walt, that's going to change the profile of what we saw in Q2 in Q3, or for that fact -- for that matter, going forward for the balance of the year.","Walter S. Liptak - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Europe, specifically in the welding business, demand trends, pricing, profitability.","David B. Speer","Welding, Europe, let's see. We have...","Walter S. Liptak - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Organic internationally, you said, was up 2%. But I presume that Europe was probably down.","David B. Speer","No. So Europe was up. Europe was up 3%, I think.","John L. Brooklier","No, Europe was up more than that.","David B. Speer","It was more Asia Pacific that was down in international.","John L. Brooklier","Now remember, while we have -- we have a smaller European presence, so our Europe numbers were actually growing at a rate of double-digit, at least for the month of June.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. For the whole quarter, it was up 3.7%, welding, Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Henry Kim from UBS.","Henry Kim","If our math is correct, the midpoint of total revenue guidance for the full year and using midpoint at the third quarter implies fourth quarter revenues up 4% year-on-year. Is it possible to discuss factors that could drive sequential acceleration from the third quarter to the fourth quarter?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. That's not what we have, so I'm not sure how you backed into that. But we're looking at the third quarter overall revenues being basically flat, driven by currency. But from a base side, as I said, we're up, where we've got 2.5% to 3% up. And it's a little bit weaker in the fourth quarter partly due to the comps.","David B. Speer","So we don't have the granular details of the fourth quarter here to talk about obviously. But I would say from a global perspective, we don't see any significant change from Q3 to Q4 in market or demand activities. So there may be some nuances based on comparables, as Ron pointed out, but no significant acceleration, if you will, in demand is part of our current full year outlook for Q4.","Ronald D. Kropp","Currency is a little bit less of a factor in the fourth quarter.","Henry Kim","Okay. That's fair. As a follow-up, is it possible to talk about how customer and channel inventory levels look right now, and any stocking or destocking embedded in your updated guidance in front of 2013?","David B. Speer","No. None that is worthy of any note, for sure. We would've expected to have our original demand forecast materialize, to see some of that occurring in Q2, which obviously did not happen. And given the current demand forecast that we see across these markets, we don't see any real stocking; restocking; or for that matter, any significant destocking at this stage. We haven't experienced it and we haven't heard a lot about it. Let's put it that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of R.W. Baird.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, before I ask my question, would you mind repeating what the gross figure was for North American Construction sales into residential? Was that a double-digit number?","John L. Brooklier","Yes, 13%.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","13%. My first question has to do with share purchases. Can you tell us how many shares you've repurchased, either year-to-date or in the second quarter? And could you comment on full year -- in the past, you've commonly talked about a range for targeted spending on repurchases. I wondered where you're at.","Ronald D. Kropp","So as I said earlier -- and I don't have the exact share number. But for the first half, we spent about $1 billion and embedded in the forecast, which is included in the $0.04 EPS benefit that we bridged on the slide -- embedded in the forecast is a total year spend of $1.3 billion. So you can back into the shares based on the share price over the year, but I want to say it's something like close to 20 million.","David B. Speer","I think it's 18 million, somewhere in the 18-million to 20-million range.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","For the full year.","David B. Speer","No.","John L. Brooklier","No, that's the year to date.","David B. Speer","So far, year-to-date...","Ronald D. Kropp","So far, yes.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. And you commented, John, when you were talking about Industrial Packaging, that in the stretch business, equipment sales led the growth. Does that mean consumables was down? And can you talk about what Signode saw in consumables versus equipment comparison, the stretch consumables?","John L. Brooklier","Stretch consumables were -- stretch consumables would have been lower. It was growing at a lower rate than the equipment. But clearly, the equipment was much stronger on the stretch side. I think you've seen the same dynamics on the Signode side, too, were...","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So I'm guessing then the implication would be that the weakness in response to macro fundamentals hasn't shown up as much in the equipment business yet, maybe because of order backlog. And then that is what we should expect for the second half.","John L. Brooklier","Well, I think -- again, I think it's really more geographical, Rob. I think North America, we're seeing trends that are more consistent with consumable and equipment sales. We were up 3% to 4% North America and we were down at a rate of about 4-ish on the European side. So I think it really has more to do with more macro trends in the geographies we're seeing as opposed to the specific categories.","David B. Speer","Rob, the other thing I would note is about 80% of our equipment sales are replacement. So I think it's probably an indication that people reached a point at which some of these pieces of equipment needed to be replaced or upgraded for productivity reasons or cost reasons. And the fact that they haven't canceled orders or delayed orders is an indication that there's a reasonable long-term view of the need for this type of equipment. And normally, the equipment would precede a big increase in consumable volumes. So it's a typical pattern that we see equipment rise, and then consumables rise secondly. And it's the same picture on the way down: equipment drops off first and consumables afterwards.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And lastly, in the Power Systems and Electronics segment, John, you talked about high single-digit expectations for the welding business in the second half. Second quarter electronics was up double-digits. Is that something that you expect to be sustained in the second half?","John L. Brooklier","Well, we know that in our electronics assembly segment of total electronics that we have orders in place that are significant with a key customer. So we have a relatively high level of confidence now. But I think the other -- what I call the other electronics category, which is more legacy, more component-related, that will continue to be under pressure.","David B. Speer","Yes. I would say that yes, we have a nice Q3 runway in that category. But beyond that, it's hard to see. And as John pointed out, it's based on some significant orders with a handful of key accounts. But the general electronics category, particularly that based on computers, is really challenged.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So we've covered a lot of ground already. Can I just clarify, Ron -- I think you mentioned overseas cash balance was $1.7 billion. Is that right?","Ronald D. Kropp","That's correct.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So all your cash is overseas right now.","Ronald D. Kropp","That's correct.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Just wondering, how does that play into your repurchase plans for the second half of the year? I mean, you got above $1 billion this year. You've done $1 billion so far. Do you plan to do more? Or do you plan to rebuild that U.S. cash balance?","Ronald D. Kropp","Well, the way our capital structure works, like most U.S. companies, is we have to do share repurchases and dividends out of the U.S. So when we put together our plans for dividends and share repurchases, we do that based on where we expect to generate the cash and how much U.S. cash we expect to have and what the appropriate debt level that we want to maintain in the U.S. is. So the $1.3 billion in share repurchases that I talked about, which is the current full year forecast, that's a reflection of all those inputs. It does not consider that we would repatriate any of that $1.7 billion at this point. We certainly could if we needed to, but there would be a tax cost to that at the time we did it. So that assumes that we continue to reinvest that cash overseas in emerging markets and other ways, but not bring it back to the U.S.","David B. Speer","And obviously, the other thing that it looks at, as Ron said, where is the cash coming from? And from our forecast, you could tell we're talking about stronger performance in the U.S. than we are in international markets. So all these things are factored into how we look at the overall capital allocation. But with a $2-billion expectation of free cash flow for the year, as I've indicated, obviously, the second half of the year cash flow is much stronger than the first half, which we would expect. We wouldn't expect to see any significant change in our U.S. debt levels as a result of this. And certainly, as Ron pointed out, no plans to do any significant repatriation.","Ronald D. Kropp","And I will point out, as we've had divestitures, for instance, the finishing business, to the extent we get net cash proceeds after tax in the U.S., we're redeploying that and buying back shares to offset some of the EPS.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I mean, U.S. cash generation is not a problem at all. But I'm just wondering, the surplus cash you generated in the second half of the year, you seemed to have a bit more of a cautious tone on M&A. Do we use that surplus cash to repurchase shares? Or do we rebuild U.S. cash balances?","Ronald D. Kropp","Well, we typically would not run U.S. cash balances. We're going to be stoking that fire [ph] overseas.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's good. And then just a quick one. What euro rates are you using for the second half of the year?","Ronald D. Kropp","We are using $1.23.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Just one clarification. The actual shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter is something like 468 million or 470 million or something like that, if you average it.","Ronald D. Kropp","I'm not sure have that handy.","John L. Brooklier","We'll get back to you.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And can we talk a little bit -- 2 questions. One is for your guidance that we talked about, relatively flattish sales. And you just gave us a little bit gain on -- in base, offset by currency. Could you see anything that's changing the profitability that we saw in the second quarter at this point? In other words, with all the changes going on, will you be able to -- you expect to be able to hold most of the profitability in the second quarter at this point?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. As we talked about, we had very strong operating performance in the second quarter. Our base incrementals were significantly higher than even 50%, typically run 35% range. And as we look out the rest of the year, we expect to continue to perform north of 50%.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So nowhere in any business -- everything looks like it's holding together. And can you talk specifically in the transportation sector, where with the decline in European auto and probably not going to get better, are you seeing any changes in demand? I mean, is the U.S. market able to sustain itself in this crazy environment through the second half of the year and you're seeing greater weakness in Europe? Or is it continuing in any change in China?","John L. Brooklier","I think that as we reported in Q2, we saw good performance in North America. Asia Pacific continues to be strong. China is still good. India is still relatively good. You're right, Eli. The major weakness is in Europe. I don't think our auto people are expecting significant deterioration beyond the numbers they're seeing right now. I mean, it could go down a couple more points in Europe. Maybe 7 turns into 8 or 9 on a decrease on builds.","David B. Speer","But I think the biggest story for us, Eli, in Europe has been penetration gains. John had pointed out in the quarter, Q2, the European build was down in the 8% range. We were up 1%. So we have had significant penetration gain. And obviously, as those platforms continue to roll out, we'll enjoy a penetration gain in subsequent quarters as well. China is an organic growth story. We've been aligned with more of the domestic manufacturers now, so we have more content there. So that's really new growth for us, if you will, to a large extent in China. And here in North America, we have continued the normal penetration process, and it pays off obviously. And North America car business in terms of sales and production has been clearly more robust than what we thought it was going to be, entering the year. So I think the transportation outlook for us is reasonably solid going forward on the OEM basis.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Do you have a forecast for builds in North America and Europe at this point, what has changed [ph]?","John L. Brooklier","The latest forecast we have is Europe is roughly the same and North America is still growing at high double -- high-teen numbers.","We're going to get end it there. We're at the top of the hour. We thank everybody for participating in the call, and I look forward to talking to a number of you later today. Thank you.","David B.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me on today's call is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Ron Kropp.","Scott, Ron and I will discuss our Q2 financial results, and in addition, we will update you on both our long-term strategic initiatives and the progress related to those, as well as our Q3 and full year forecasts.","Here is the agenda for today's call. Scott will highlight our Q2 operating results and our strategic initiatives. Ron will cover our Q2 results in more detail. I will then talk about our geographic revenue performance and highlight our segment results. Ron will then come back and update you on our 2013 full year forecast and introduce our Q3 forecast.","Finally, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] And as always, we have allotted 1 hour for today's call.","A couple housekeeping items. First, this presentation contains our financial forecast for full year 2013, the quarter and other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer everybody to the company's 2012 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations.","Now let's move to another housekeeping item. The telephone replay for this conference call is (800) 308-7855. No pass code is necessary, and the playback will be available until midnight of August 6.","Now let me introduce our CEO, Scott Santi, who will make some comments on the quarter. Scott?","E. Scott Santi","Thank you, John, and good morning. In the second quarter, we are able to offset modestly lower-than-expected revenues with profitability contributions from our enterprise initiatives in order to achieve the midpoint of our Q2 EPS forecast of $1.08, excluding the $0.05 pension charge that Ron will discuss in a few minutes.","From a revenue standpoint, softer-than-anticipated demand in our North American Industrial Packaging, Polymers and Fluid and Welding segments resulted in overall organic growth coming in 100 basis points below our expectations heading into the quarter. Also, our electronics assembly platform within our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment also faced challenging comps versus last year, as well as continued softness in their end markets. As a result, overall company organic revenues in North America were down 1% in the quarter versus last year.","Our Automotive OEM segment continued to perform at a very high level in the quarter, benefiting from focused product development and customer penetration against the backdrop of pretty good worldwide auto builds.","Overall, industrial demand remains choppy with the exception of a few pockets like Construction and Food Equipment in North America.","On the profitability side, we continued to make solid progress in the quarter. Adjusted Q2 operating margins of 17.4% were up 40 basis points year-over-year. The impact of our enterprise initiatives contributed 60 basis points of margin improvement in Q2. And excluding the $25 million of incremental restructuring expense supporting those initiatives versus Q2 of last year, our adjusted operating margins would've been 18% in the quarter.","Overall, we continue to make excellent progress in the execution of our enterprise initiatives across the company. We are at or ahead of our internal 2013 plans for all 3 initiatives and are generating meaningful progress towards our overall enterprise performance goals of 20% plus pretax margins and 20% plus after-tax return on invested capital by 2017.","We are well positioned to fully leverage the benefits of these initiatives as global end markets improve.","Looking at the balance of 2013, we are essentially maintaining the midpoint of our full year EPS forecast on an operating basis, though reducing it by $0.05 to $4.20 to reflect the Q2 pension settlement charge. While we expect the demand environment to continue to be uneven, we believe contributions from our enterprise initiatives will keep us on a path of continued profitability improvement for the remainder of 2013 and beyond.","Now let me turn the call over to Ron. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Before I review our second quarter operating results, I wanted to walk through some adjustments impacting comparisons in our second quarter financials.","In the second quarter of 2013, we recognized a $34 million pretax pension settlement charge. This charge was primarily related to higher lump sum pension payments related to the exit of our Decorative Surfaces employees from the ITW pension plan. We've excluded this onetime charge when we're discussing our EPS performance for the quarter. At this time, we don't expect any significant pension impact related to settlements for the remainder of the year. Also, as we discussed last quarter, our Q2 2012 comparisons exclude the Decorative Surfaces segment operating results.","Now here are the highlights for the second quarter. Total revenues increased 1%, excluding the 2012 Decorative Surfaces revenue. Worldwide organic revenues were flat, while revenue from acquisitions grew 1%. Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, adjusted operating income was $736 million, which was higher than our 2012 adjusted operating income by $26 million or 3.7%.","Adjusted operating margins of 17.4% or 40 basis points higher than last year. Excluding the pension settlement charge, diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.08, which represents a 6% growth over our adjusted 2012 EPS and within our forecasted EPS midpoint.","Our 1% revenue increase in the second quarter was primarily due to the following factors: Base revenues were flat, with international revenues growing 1.1%. We saw some stabilization in our European organic revenues, which only declined 1%, while our Asia Pacific organic revenues increased 2.6%, led by strong growth in China and India.","Our North American-based revenues decreased 1% as our equipment businesses declined by 4%. This softness was especially evident in our electronics assembly platform as they faced challenging comps from last year and continued to see weakness in the general electronics industry. Excluding the 38% decline in the electronics assembly platform, North America base revenues would have grown 1.0%.","If you look at product mix, worldwide organic revenues were up 1% in our consumable business, while as I said, we saw a 4% decline in our worldwide equipment business. Acquisition added 1.0% to revenue growth.","Adjusted operating margins for the second quarter of 17.4% were 40 basis points higher than Q2 2012. Base business margins were up 100 basis points from last year. A key driver was a 60-basis-point improvement from the results of our enterprise initiatives, largely related to our business structure simplification activities, as well as some benefits from sourcing leverage.","Price cost favorability improved margins 50 basis points.","In addition, total operating margins were negatively impacted by $25 million in higher restructuring costs versus last year, reducing our overall margins by 60 basis points.","Despite our flat organic revenue from soft North American end markets and $25 million in dollars in higher restructuring cost, our bottom line adjusted operating margin improved 40 basis points versus last year. We continue to see the positive impacts from our enterprise initiatives while continuing to manage overhead costs in an uneven macroeconomic environment.","Our working capital and cash flow continued to be strong as accounts receivable DSO was 62 days, which was a slight improvement versus last year. And inventory months on hand improved to 1.7.","Adjusted ROIC for the second quarter was 16.1%, which was a 70-basis-point improvement versus the second quarter of last year. Our ROIC continues to improve toward our target of 20-plus percent by 2017.","Net cash provided from operating activities was $643 million for the second quarter, with capital expenditures of $89 million, resulting in free operating cash flow of $554 million and over $800 million of cash generated in the first half of the year. We generated 35% more free operating cash flow versus the second quarter of 2012 despite several large businesses being divested in the past year. For the year, we expect conversion of free operating cash flow to be close to 100% of income from continuing operations.","Turning to capital structure. Continue to focus on capital allocation priorities as follows: Our first priority continues to be organic investments, especially focused on our key growth initiatives. Examples of our organic investments include R&D spending, additional investments in manufacturing capacity and restructuring projects, which have long-term margin benefits.","Our next capital priority is dividends. Note that our normal January dividend of $174 million was paid on December 31 last year to allow our shareholders to benefit from the lower 2012 dividend tax rate. Our current dividend yield continues to be over 2%.","Any excess capital after organic investments and dividends is used for external investments, either share repurchases or acquisitions. We evaluate the allocation between these investments based on the best risk-adjusted returns and assess acquisition targets by incorporating our portfolio management criteria of accelerated growth and strong differentiation potential.","In the second quarter, we had $310 million in share repurchases and have had nearly $700 million in repurchases in the first half of the year. As we look ahead through the remainder of the year, we have increased our share repurchase forecast from free operating cash flow for the year to be at least $1 billion versus the $850 million we communicated in April. In addition, we tend to use -- we intend to use any U.S. after-tax divestiture proceeds for share repurchases as well. As of the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under our current buyback program.","We utilized $95 million for acquisitions during the first half of the year, with a continued focus on our growth platforms in emerging markets. In early July, we added to our portfolio with other focused acquisition targets as we closed on 2 acquisitions, a Chinese food equipment business and a European consumer packaging equipment supplier. As we continue to shape our portfolio, our focus remains on 2 key criteria: accelerated growth spaces and a strong differentiation potential.","Lastly, our Q2 debt-to-capital ratio is 33%, while our debt to adjusted EBITDA remained constant at 1.5x. Our cash balance overseas is nearly $2.8 billion, and we have plenty of debt capacity to make additional investments.","I will now turn it back over to John, who will provide more details on the operating results by geography and individual segments.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Ron. Let me take just a few minutes to review our Q2 '13 geographic trends. Excluding the impact of currency and the 2012 revenues from the former debt services segment, total company revenues grew 1% in Q2. And as Ron noted earlier, total company organic revenues were flat in the quarter, with North American organic revenues declining 1% and international organic revenues growing 1%. Most notably, European organic revenues declined only 1% and Asia Pacific organic revenues grew 3%. The positives for us in Q2 were in China and Brazil, where our organic revenues grew 14% and 19%, respectively.","Moving to the next slide, for our Q2 segment results. It's important to note that while our total company organic revenues were flat, the major negative impact came from our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. As Ron mentioned, the segment had very difficult year-over-year comps and experienced in-market softness in the electronics assembly platform. Notably, our total company organic revenues would've been 130 basis points higher if this platform had produced flat organic revenues on a year-over-year basis.","Looking at profitability, 6 out of our 8 segments produced operating margin improvement, ranging from 40 basis points of improvement from our Construction segment to 230 basis points of improvement for our Food Equipment segment. From my earlier comments, our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment was hit with a 200 basis points operating margin decline.","If you recall from last quarter, we added an adjusted operating margin metric as part of our portfolio segmentation, which excludes intangible amortization and other noncash acquisition accounting items from operating income. We continue to see that our more acquisitive segments, primarily Test & Measurement and Electronics, as well as Polymers & Fluids, show a much more consistent performance comparability when we look at adjusted operating margins across our segments.","Now let's take a peek at our 8 reporting segments, beginning with Test & Measurement and Electronics. This segment had an organic revenue decline of 9%. T&M's worldwide organic revenues declined 2% as demand for capital equipment was muted in the quarter, particularly in North America. And as noted earlier, total electronics organic revenues fell 16% as the electronics assembly business faced tough comps in soft end markets. We anticipate that the third quarter will also prove to be a difficult comparison for electronics assembly due to the fact they had a major customer order in the third quarter of 2012.","Much better news, on the Automotive OEM side, which Scott referenced earlier. It was our fastest-growing segment. In aggregate, Auto OEMs organic revenues grew a very solid 12% versus a worldwide auto build of 3%. The Auto OEM formula remains the same. New product innovation and new platform penetration equals enhanced growth versus new car builds.","By geography, while European auto builds grew 1% in the quarter, our organic revenues increased 11% there. Strong performance in Europe.","Our key OEM relationships with Volkswagen, Ford and GM in Europe continue to be a successful formula for us. In North America, organic revenues of 7% were slightly ahead of our 6% auto builds. And finally, in China, organic revenues grew 40% versus auto builds of 11%. All in all, it was another excellent quarter for our Automotive segment. Operating margins of 20.6% improved 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis.","Moving to Polymers & Fluids. Organic revenues were again defined by ongoing product line simplification, what we call PLS activities, and a loss of key customers. Organic revenues for worldwide polymers in hygiene, as well as fluids both declined 4% in the quarter. Automotive aftermarket organic revenues decreased 2% due to ongoing PLS programs and a loss of a key customer. We believe the sorting-out process of unprofitable customers will diminish as the year progresses. And despite some pressure on the top line, we continue to be very pleased with the profitability arc of the segment. Operating margins of 18.1% were 150 basis points higher than the prior year period.","In Food Equipment, conditions improved modestly in North America for capital equipment but remained difficult in Europe. This resulted in segment organic growth of 1% in the quarter. Total Food Equipment North America's organic revenues grew 5% with equipment increasing 4% due in part to higher cooking revenues for customers serving independent restaurants, lodging area and nursing facilities and schools.","North America service organic revenues grew a very healthy 5% in the quarter. Internationally, Food Equipment's organic revenues declined 2%. Notably, equipment sales fell 7% as cooking and refrigeration slowed in France, Italy and the U.K. Much like North America, service revenues grew an impressive 7% in the quarter.","Even with muted overall growth, this segment produced operating margins of 18.7%. That's 230 basis points higher than the year-ago period. But clearly, lots of good things happening in the Food Equipment area.","In our Welding segment, worldwide organic revenues were flat as North American revenues grew and international revenues declined. In North America, organic revenues were up 1% in part due to new product launches in the commercial sector that include MRO of small manufacture and commercial construction customers. Internationally, revenues -- organic revenues declined 2% largely due to slowing in Asia and the repositioning of the portfolio from shipbuilding to oil and gas and infrastructure activities. In Asia, the major areas of decline emanated from China and Australia. Despite all this, operating margins of 26.5% were 60 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","In Construction Products, organic revenues were flat, as reasonably good growth in North America was offset by declines but at moderating rates in Europe. In North America, total organic revenues grew 2%, with both U.S. residential organic revenues up 2% and renovation organic revenues up 8%.","U.S. commercial construction organic revenues declined 2%, mainly due to softness in the metal business segment and some related PLS activities.","In Europe, our organic revenues fell 4% as much improved performance over Q1, when European Construction revenues declined 10%. Asia Pacific organic revenues grew 3% in the quarter, and this was a turnaround from Q1, when organic revenues declined 1%.","Operating margins of 13.8% continued their movement upward, a 40-basis-point improvement versus the year-ago period.","In Specialty Products, the segment organic revenues grew 2% in the quarter. Segment growth was helped by 2% organic growth from the consumer packaging businesses. In particular, global packaging systems led the way, thanks to accelerated growth of warehouse automation system, which includes our Vertique and Hartness businesses.","Our ground support business produced organic revenue growth of 12% in the quarter, while organic revenues for our worldwide appliance businesses declined 4%. Operating margins were strong at 22.4%, and that's an increase of 40 basis points versus the year-ago period.","Finally, in our Industrial Packaging segment, which Ron referenced earlier, worldwide organic revenues declined 1%. Total North American Industrial Packaging organic revenues decreased 3% due to moderating industrial production trends and softness in the food and beverage category. Internationally, the news was a bit better as organic revenues increased 1%. Please note that this was the first positive international revenue number we've produced since the fourth quarter of 2011.","Now let me turn the call over to Ron, who will update you on our forecast. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thanks, John. As a reminder, our 2012 comparisons exclude the operating results of the former Decorative Surfaces segment as well as the fourth quarter 2012 gain on divestiture and equity interest.","For the full year 2013, our forecasted EPS range for continuing operations is $4.10 to $4.30. This range assumes a total revenue increase of 0.5% to 2.5% versus an adjusted 2012. This range is slightly lower than our April forecast as we now anticipate organic revenue growth of negative 1% to plus 1% for the year.","Additionally, we expect our full year operating margins to be in a range of 16.9% to 17.3% versus 2012 margins of 16.3%. Our midpoint of $4.20 would be 14% higher than the 2012 adjusted EPS of $3.70. The full year EPS midpoint of $4.20 is down $0.05 from our prior forecast due to the $0.05 pension settlement charge from this quarter. As Scott mentioned, we have kept our second half operating forecast the same.","Despite the uneven end market environment for some of our segments, we remain confident that our enterprise initiatives and strong overhead management will help deliver our bottom line.","For the third quarter of 2013, we are forecasting diluted income per share for continuing operations to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.16, which assumes a total revenue growth of 3% to 5%.","The midpoint of the Q3 diluted EPS range of $1.11 would be a 9% increase versus the 2012 pro forma EPS of $1.02.","I'll now turn it back over to John for the Q&A.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Ron. We'll now open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ajay Kejriwal.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So just to maybe clarify on the full year guide. The $0.05 in pension, so is that being excluded from the guide or is it included?","Ronald D. Kropp","No, so the current guidance, the midpoint is $4.20. The prior guidance was $4.25. So the only real change to the EPS guidance was the $0.05 charge that we recognized in the second quarter.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. So on a non-GAAP basis, if we were to exclude, it's essentially the same?","Ronald D. Kropp","Correct.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. So that's helpful. And then on Test & Measurement, could you maybe talk a little bit about expectations? I know you -- third quarter, you have tough comps. But just color on what you're seeing with your customers, please.","E. Scott Santi","What I would say, Ajay, is quote activity remains good in the T&M space. Electronics is still fairly weak. The color in the T&M space is the quote activity remains fairly robust. But there is in the short run some level of, let's say, hesitation in terms of actually customers converting those quotations to actual orders. But our expectations are things continue to move forward at an okay pace, and hopefully, accelerate a little bit as we move through the year. I think I don't need -- the electronic side, I think we're expecting the year to be pretty tough all the way around.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And maybe one more before I pass it on. On the Auto OEs, you're seeing very, very nice penetration. Just maybe talk about sustainability and expectation in the second half.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think we're very well positioned there. It's the one part of our business where we have a fairly strong level of forward visibility in that we are selling new content on new models of cars as they are engineered and developed. So we are set up there for a pretty nice run over the next several years based on programs that we know we have that will be on new models moving into the market. So I think we're very comfortable through the balance of the year for -- that we'll have continued strong performance there and into '14 and '15 as well.","John L. Brooklier","Yes. And I would just also add that if you look on from a car build perspective in the second half, we don't expect big movement or big changes in car build projections, which have been reasonably good around the world.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Cook.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. One, I thought your comments on the international Industrial Packaging businesses were interesting in terms of you were up, and it was the first time that you've seen -- I guess, that you've been positive since the fourth quarter of 2011. So if you could just give some color on what actually drove the strength there. And then how sustainable do you think that is? And then I guess, just my second question. Last quarter, when you guys did your earnings call, you said in March, you saw an improvement, I think, in U.S. markets, Welding, Food, as well as Test & Measurement. Obviously, things have changed. But can you just give us some color on when things sort of broke down in the quarter, which month?","E. Scott Santi","Okay. On the Industrial Packaging side, in terms of international revenue, the big contributions on the plus side came out of India and China. Europe was still down modestly year-on-year in the quarter. And in terms of the capital spending environment in Q2, I -- what I would say is I think things were relatively sluggish throughout the quarter as -- and you talked about the segments that were affected. Food Equipment actually stayed pretty strong through the quarter. But certainly, in Welding, relative to what we saw towards the back half of Q1, things certainly moderated in Q2, and likewise, in the Test & Measurement arena as well. So there was no sort of fall-off-the-cliff in the second quarter. We do have an element of seasonality that's baked into our planning between Q1 and Q2. That's pretty normal. And what I would say is we just didn't see as much acceleration in Q2 as we normally would seasonally. But all 3 of those businesses were up sequentially in second quarter versus Q1. So it wasn't a big deceleration. It was just a lack of -- maybe the best way to describe it is things didn't ramp at the same rate as we would normally expect in Q2.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Wertheimer.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just wanted to check in. You gave comments on the construction market, but it continues to be a bit soft. Can you comment at all on commercial construction on whether you're gaining or losing penetration\/share in the U.S. and globally?","John L. Brooklier","Well, I would say that if you look at the commercial construction numbers, particular in North America, I think they're roughly in line with what we're seeing with Dodge construction data, which is measured on a square footage basis. I don't think there's any disconnect there on the commercial side. Commercial has been much slower to recover. I think from the last set of numbers, we saw commercial was down roughly 1 or 2 points. So I think our numbers are roughly in line with those. So I don't think it's a penetration issue at all. I think it's just the market itself has been slower to recover as it tries to recover in line with what's going on, on the housing side.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then this is an unrelated follow-up. Could you talk about the ramp in strategic initiatives, the savings that you've gotten to date? Is that sort of the run rate for the rest of the year? Or is it a continually gradual process? I just don't know the pace at which you're rolling out programs and implementing changes.","Ronald D. Kropp","So as we said, the enterprise initiatives had a 60-basis-point benefit in the second quarter. And as we continue to do simplification activities and additional sourcing, we'll continue to see that ramp up not just next quarter but as we move through the next year or 2. So I would expect a bigger impact in the third quarter than the second quarter.","E. Scott Santi","And just to add to that, as you may recall, the impact from initiatives was 40 basis points in Q1. We got to 60 in Q2, and I think that's not an infinite slope in that line. But certainly over the next 6 or 8 quarters, we would expect to just continue to see further progress on that front.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So in North American Welding, you have some distinct businesses in Welding levered toward oil and gas, levered toward heavy equipment, machinery customers. When you look at 2Q, what did you see in those distinct businesses? Did the major -- did the heavy equipment customers, did they continue to destock in the quarter and that affected the Welding business? Or was it just more of a slowdown in oil and gas still affecting the business? And did you see any improvement in that business as the oil prices have ticked up here recently?","E. Scott Santi","We didn't see any improvement. I would say, dimensionally, the heavy equipment sector was softer in Q2 relative to oil and gas. I think in both areas, particularly on the capital of the equipment side, what we saw was certainly more continued tentativeness there around new equipment purchases. But probably, the heavy equipment's end market is softer than the oil and gas in the quarter.","John L. Brooklier","And I would just like to take you back to what I said earlier, Andy, when we talked about the commercial construction piece being the best piece for us in North America. If you think about that, that tends to be sort of a smaller equipment investment around smaller manufacturers and other related buyers. So I think that the dichotomy between the 2, between the heavy industrial side or the heavy equipment manufacturers and that, is sort of representative of what's going on in Welding right now. I don't think we see -- we're not projecting any further significant declines at this point in time.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, guys. And then, Scott or John, Europe, it was only down 1% after being down 6% year-over-year last quarter. A lot of this does seem like your Auto outperformance, but maybe you could talk about the quarter itself. Are you getting -- are most markets at least stable to modestly improving sequentially in Europe? Can we call a bottom here and now an improvement yet or not really?","E. Scott Santi","I think we have relatively high degree of confidence that Europe has bottomed. Certain pockets have gotten a little bit better. I don't think we've seen anything that's gotten demonstrably worse. So I think it's a bottom. The question is, how long will the bottom take place? We're clearly not calling for big recovery in Europe, but I think that it's positive for us and other companies that Europe is showing signs of stability at the bottom. So we'll continue to ramp up probably good numbers from our Auto business, and then we'll keep track of what's going on in our businesses and obviously update you on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, would you say that Construction outperformed your expectations in Europe, or is it just kind of trending in line with easier comps?","E. Scott Santi","I would say probably more in line with comps. One of the things about Europe, obviously, is that you start to comp these numbers, and comps are going to help your comparison numbers. But I'd say Construction in general is probably where we would've expected it to be.","Operator","Andy Casey.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple things. Can we walk through the drivers of Food Equipment, the 230-basis-point margin improvement? Was that all volume price and mix, or was there some benefit from the enterprise strategy in there as well?","Ronald D. Kropp","It was a little bit of everything. Price\/cost had a benefit of about 70 basis points. Enterprise initiatives had about 40. We just said we saw overall better variable margins exclusive of price\/cost of 90, better overhead control of 30.","E. Scott Santi","And the part of that would be mix and the strong performance out of the service business in both Europe and North America.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then second, I'm wondering on your full year operating margin guidance. You have pretty good performance in terms of year-over-year improvement in price\/cost and enterprise benefits year-to-date. But it really doesn't look like you're expecting any significant improvement in operating margin performance during the second half. First, is that a correct assessment? And then second, why wouldn't you be seeing some flow-through from those benefits into the second half?","Ronald D. Kropp","So if you look at the margins, in the second half, they're about at the run rate as they were in the second quarter if you back out the pension charge. So without the pension charge of 17.4%, back half margins are in that range for the rest of the year. The prior year margins, while we did have a very strong margin third quarter, primarily due to some corporate adjustments, favorable corporate adjustments -- it was 17.5% last year -- fourth quarter was 14.9%. So we are overall improving quite a bit in the second half, and a lot of that improvement is coming from enterprise initiatives.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's basically flat from here. Will we expect a step-up through the second half?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, I mean, certainly, in the fourth quarter, 14.9% versus 17% plus is a pretty significant margin improvement. The other element of this is, as we saw in the second quarter, we're expecting a higher restructuring spend year-over-year. So even with that higher restructuring spend, we're seeing significant margin improvement.","Operator","Ann Duignan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Ann Duignan. Two follow-up questions really. On the Automotive outperformance, can you just give us a little bit more color on what products and what platforms are winning in Europe and in China? Is there an opportunity to take those new products in Europe to China in a year or 2? Or is this kind of a global rollout of a new product and it's simultaneous across the world?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think a core strategy, without necessarily getting into specific products on specific platforms, is that we have very much -- the Automotive business is globalizing, so we very much are focused on sort of major global OEMs and our ability to ultimately invest in innovation and new product development in opportunities that have sort of major potential to expand both from the standpoint of different OEMs and also on a global basis. The story in China right now is a function of the fact that the quality of cars that they're building in China more and more has reached the point where the kind of solutions that we offer are things that they need. So as the overall standards of the quality and features that they are starting to put in the cars in China is certainly creating more and more opportunities for us to bring content that we've already engineered in North America or Europe into the China market.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, I guess. And then on the enterprise initiatives, are we sort of done now with the business unit consolidation and now we're moving into more of the strategic sourcing, i.e., we should look for the improvement going forward to show up in gross margin versus SG&A? Or is it going to be a mix of both going forward? If you could help us from a modeling perspective where you'd expect the improvements to show up would be helpful.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, so in 2 quarters, we're done with the BSS, which have -- I'm going to give you sort of a -- try to give you a flavor without -- not having a lot of sort of authoritative facts behind this. But what I would say is we're at best 15% of the way through BSS in terms of the kind of moves that we have on the board and the things that we're going to do. We're getting what I would describe as some very consequential but low-hanging fruit benefits at this stage, but this has probably got another 2 to 3 years to run on BSS. And likewise, on sourcing, as we've talked before, we are at the early stages. I think I'm very pleased with our progress in '13 on sourcing, but ultimately have some -- the big benefits still ahead of us in terms of '14, '15, '16.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So more of a gross margin impact from the sourcing as we move into '14 and '15, is that the way we should think about it?","E. Scott Santi","On a relative basis, but I wouldn't discount the BSS in terms of continuing impacts for the next -- for '14, '15 and some of '16.","Operator","Stephen Volkmann.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of cleanup items, if I could. What's the organic growth forecast for the third quarter that's in the 3% to 5% total revenue growth?","Ronald D. Kropp","Organic growth for the third quarter? 1%. 1%.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","1%, great. And the quarter end share count?","Ronald D. Kropp","Quarter end share count, 447 million.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then restructuring spending in 2014, is it going to be up or down over '13, do we think?","Ronald D. Kropp","It's really the same, but I would expect it would not be up significantly at the high end.","Operator","Schon Williams.","Christopher Schon Williams - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","You guys have been vocal in the past about wanting to expand within quick-serve restaurants in the Food Equipment space. Obviously, you did a purchase here, the Chinese manufacturer. I'm just wondering, is that it? Are we kind of done with that, or is there more acquisitions to be done over the next couple quarters there?","E. Scott Santi","On the quick-serve space?","Christopher Schon Williams - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Well, in the quick-serve space or Food Equipment in general. I mean, whichever you feel...","E. Scott Santi","I think the major thrust within Food Equipment is innovation-based organic growth. We will certainly continue to look at M&A opportunities as they arise, like we did in China. And I think we're very enthusiastic about how that business fits strategically with our growth plans and opportunities in China. But I would say the major thrust going forward for us in Food Equipment is to continue to build a much stronger organic-growing business through an accelerated rate of innovation there.","Christopher Schon Williams - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I mean, should expect that most of the acquisition activity for the portfolio going forward is going to be concentrated within Food Equipment? Or is this kind of, again, it's going to be kind of more one-off here and there?","E. Scott Santi","I wouldn't say it would be concentrated in Food Equipment. I think what we have said as part of our enterprise strategy overall is that this company, our focus is on really building a much more robust, organic front-end engine as our primary growth thrust and that we will certainly supplement that ramp with good strategic acquisitions as those opportunities arise. But ultimately, those opportunities may arise in any one of the operating segments that we're in today. But ultimately, that's not the front end in terms of really how we think about and how we're focused on driving growth going forward.","John L. Brooklier","By example, if you look at what we've acquired thus far this year, I mean, they fall under the areas such as Food Equipment in China. We've also done deals in Welding in Europe, and we've also done, I believe, a couple of deals on the consumer packaging side. So very much targeted to the areas we've talked about that we think have big potential for differentiation and longer-term growth.","E. Scott Santi","Right. Highly differentiated technologies in end markets that we are -- that we know and understand very well.","Operator","John Inch.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The weaker North American welding results, do you guys think you lost share for whatever reason to either Lincoln or ESAB? Just thinking, ESAB is now got new management. I think they've launched a new product. What are your thoughts?","E. Scott Santi","Our thoughts today would be, no. I think we'll obviously -- yes, we're very focused on this. The Welding business is a business that's been a very strong organic growth for us across a very long period. Our expectations are going forward that, that will continue to be at the high end of our overall organic growth performance in terms of our portfolio. I think given that the market positions that we have in areas like equipment space, I think our view is what we said before, that Q2 was really more of a demand issue in certain key end markets like heavy equipment and oil and gas.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Scott, the North American result is kind of a point of a differential growth that you called out. Was any of this attributable to Canada? The Canadian economy hasn't been particularly great lately. I'm just wondering if that's perhaps part of some of the mix of slightly softer revenue there.","E. Scott Santi","I don't think it was geographic, John. I think it was really around, again, the 3 segments that we talked about. Industrial Packaging was much softer than we expected. Welding was a little softer, as were Polymers & Fluids in North America.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then just lastly, on restructuring, obviously, with enterprise initiatives, the nature of your restructuring and sort of the approach and so forth is different than what sort of legacy ITW would have pursued in terms of its restructuring. Can you talk about that a little bit, Scott, in the context of your initiatives? Are you finding restructuring -- maybe just a little more color? Are you finding restructuring somewhat more challenging, easier? Has it been -- have you picked off a lot of the low-hanging fruit? Or just anything that might give us a sense of sort of the approach and the paybacks, just something that might help us take a look at this.","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think this is -- most of what this -- the concentration of spend right now is really around supporting our business structure simplification initiative where we've talked about building scale from the bottom up in our structure and ultimately a landing spot of 105 or so much larger, much more globally competitive divisions. So I think the activity is concentrated there. We are -- I talked about this a little bit on the last call, but I think from the standpoint of the strategic benefits around this and the operating cost benefits, our management team is very motivated, very much behind this initiative, lots of opportunity to both position ourselves to be much more competitive on a global basis to accelerate organic growth and at the same time drive some pretty consequential overall structural cost savings. So I don't -- it's not -- I don't know how to characterize it in terms of any difference. I think it's not dissimilar from restructuring that we would do when we acquired new businesses. So I don't -- I guess, I don't know how to fully answer your question other than...","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, it's mostly also -- I'm assuming then people and overhead hasn't really -- you have been tackling plants or...","E. Scott Santi","No, I would say we absolutely have been tackling facilities, plant consolidations as part of this activity, absolutely.","Operator","Mig Dobre.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, I'd like to go back to the Food Equipment segment and to your recent acquisition in China. Is there any color you can provide us with regards to Vesta's size and relevance in the Chinese market? And strategically, how are you thinking about this acquisition? Do you see -- how do their products compare, for instance, from an innovation standpoint, with some of the brands that you've got here in the U.S.? And do you see some potential for technology and manufacturing sharing with the brands that you currently have?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, absolutely. I think the way I would characterize it in terms of how much we probably want to say about it is what we -- I think the combination of that business with our business has great benefits both ways. It has -- it's a business that operates at a scale well above what we operated at in China up to this point. So what comes with it is a manufacturing footprint and a local R&D capability that is certainly a big step-up in terms of scale. There's some strong differentiation in the product lines that we acquired. We certainly feel both through our existing -- technologies that exist in our existing product lines that we're going to be able to supplement their product portfolio. And likewise, from the standpoint of service capability, big footprint there already, something that in terms of some of the knowledge and know-how we might bring and might learn from them in return. Some really nice benefits both from us to them and them to us in this.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And I guess, my follow-up here would be over time, do you see Vesta as a potential player in Western markets as well?","E. Scott Santi","It's early. I don't know if we'd want say much. I think it's largely a China play.","Operator","Deane Dray.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Covered a lot of ground here. I do have a question for Scott on the electronics business, kind of a broader question. This is not the first quarter where we've seen some sharp volatility and cyclicality in this business, and the issue is this business is on a completely different cadence with most of your other or all of your other industrial businesses. So maybe just to hear from you, since you've been through this whole portfolio rationalization, is electronics a core business within ITW? And maybe what are the key values? Is it market share, synergies with others, cash flow? Or just maybe hear your comments on that.","E. Scott Santi","Sure. I would absolutely tell you that we are thinking a lot about the cyclicality issues in electronics. I think at its core, what I would say is, I think we've been very selective about the pieces of the electronic markets that we choose to play in. I think we, in particular, we like a couple of spots where we are in terms of, again, some of those sort of value-creation attributes of those spaces. There are some spaces that are relatively under-attended in our view in a market that on a long-term basis, the sentimentals are that they're going to grow and grow quite a bit. We make good money. This is -- it's a space where ITW in the aggregate, where we -- it certainly is accretive to our overall margin and return goals, even on the dips. And I think margins in electronic space, even on a big decline year-on-year, we're still in the high-teens for us. So I think we're -- I guess, what I would say, Deane, is I think there are some things there that remain interesting for us on a long-term basis. But I also think we have to understand how to manage in that space in a way where it's less of an outlier in certain instances.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then on the auto builds, I mean, this is a pattern that we've seen play out over the years, where ITW outpaces builds, U.S., Europe. But it really looks outsized this quarter. Is the expectations on how you can sustain this lead over, is it all market share, it's new product innovations? But again, this is high-quality problem where you're having to explain the performance versus global builds.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I -- what I would say is worth commenting on there, is I think the strategy today for us in the Automotive is very different than some of those prior cycles that you referenced, and the growth engine here is -- today is all about sort of proprietary, solution-based, new content. So we're not at the end of RFQs. As a supplier, we are really focused in on high value, solving sort of big pain point issues for Auto OEM. So from the standpoint of -- we've talked about this before, overall content in North America in the mid-$60 a car range today; Europe around $50; and Asia at $20. On an overall, average material cost in a car is, let's say, $15,000. Is there another $30 or $40 we can find a really innovative important solutions for our customers over time? We have a lot of conviction about that opportunity being out there. So from a sustainability standpoint, the strategy today is very different, much more tightly focused on the kinds of the things I talked about. And so I think both as I try to dimension the overall size of the opportunity and the uniqueness of our strategy -- and by the way, we're pretty uniquely positioned as the only company out there that can deliver these solutions on a global basis. So I think we've got again a very different strategy and a lot of conviction about our ability to sustain some pretty strong outperformance here for some time to come.","Operator","Nigel Coe.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I agree. I mean, the Automotive performance is outstanding. We don't see too many suppliers with 20% margins. And I'm just wondering, just, do you get any pushback from the OEMs on those levels of margins?","E. Scott Santi","Well, in the end, to say we don't would probably not be accurate. But in the end, it's all about the value of the solution. And we're not -- again, we're not in big dollar spaces. We're I think in general, that our OEMs -- our customers appreciate the value that we deliver, which is we help them solve, again, sort of big problems that they have in ways that ultimately make them more money and help them be more effective as businesses. So in the end, it's really about -- we're going to get paid if we do our job.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right, right. I just have a couple quick questions that cover a lot of ground here. But just looking at the 4.4% midpoint revenue growth guidance for 3Q. I think, John, you mentioned 1% organic growth within that. So is the 3-point bridge from M&A? And if so, is that sort of incremental [ph] investor or are there some other acquisitions coming through there?","John L. Brooklier","2% of it is acquisitions-related, and the rest is currency and other stuff.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So 1 point from currency, 2 points from acquisitions and 1 point of organic, okay. And then the second thing is, I think, Ron, this is your last quarter. I'm just wondering where you are in terms of the CFO replacement.","Ronald D. Kropp","We are making progress.","Operator","Joseph Ritchie.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I had a quick question on the earnings bridge on Slide 13. It looks like you've taken down revenue guidance, that should be slightly offset by the increased share repurchases. But it seems like there's implicitly potentially higher margins or cost-out that should have to happen in order for you to maintain your guidance or the midpoint of your guidance. So help me rectify that.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, so I think here's the way I would look at it. The revenue forecast is down from where we were before. The margins are basically the same. So that means we are taking additional cost out to basically hold the income contribution from base. So that's the $0.32 in the bridge from base. From a share repurchase perspective, although we've increased the total for the year because most of that'll come in the back half of the year in the fourth quarter, it'll have very little impact. So it didn't really have a EPS impact in the current year. Certainly, it will going forward.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then I guess, a follow-up to that is as it relates to that $0.32 base. I think last quarter, you mentioned about $0.18 to $0.19 was going to come from the enterprise initiatives. Thus far, this year, you've done about $0.06. Have you increased that target then?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, certainly, as we talked about earlier, it is accelerating. So it's a little bit higher than what we talked about last time, probably in the $0.20 range.","Operator","David Raso.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a further clarification on the guidance. The 1% you took out of the full year organic growth rate, did that come out of North America solely, or is it a mix?","Ronald D. Kropp","A mix.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A mix. And then for the share count, you mentioned 447 million at the end of the quarter. Was that a diluted number or a basic number?","Ronald D. Kropp","That is a basic.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","It is a basic, so it's more around 450 million diluted?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, yes.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Because I'm just trying to come up with it. It does seem to imply maybe that the prior answer just now -- I didn't fully catch -- the margins seem to have to improve unless am I not recognizing the share repo steps up notably from, say, $300 million a quarter? How significant is the repo in the back half? You still kept it as an $0.18 benefit.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. Yes, as I said earlier, we did increase it $150 million, but that's all going to fall in the fourth quarter, and it's going to have very little impact and really no EPS impact in the current year. So what's happening on the margins is, normally when revenues come down, you'd expect there'd-- everything else being equal, there'd be a deterioration in margins. And so we're holding our margins the same. That's how we're getting basically to the same EPS.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And for the margins in the second half, you said they'd be similar to 2Q. But the amount suggests they have to be in the upper 17s.","Ronald D. Kropp","Well, 2Q as adjusted, if you back out the pension. 17.4%.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, so you got your comp in. Yes. But it's actually 17.4% even if you pull out the $34 million from SG&A.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, that's what I'm saying, is the 17.4% or in a similar range for the rest of the year.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, not to nickel and dime you here, but I mean, the margins have to be higher than 17.4% the rest of the year on that revenue base with that kind of share count to hit 4.20x all in or 4.25x, right?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, and it's in the range. I mean, we're not...","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Oh, okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And the restructuring cadence again. Year-over-year, you said it was $25 million more in 2Q year-over-year. What's the cadence again in 3Q, 4Q on a year-over-year basis?","Ronald D. Kropp","We're seeing some increase but not as much. So probably in the $20 million in the second half above last year.","Operator","Walt Liptak.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on the guidance, too. The organic revenue growth being a little bit lighter, is that a result of the second quarter, or is it more of a forward look on the full year? And then which segments are performing at a lower rate than you thought of back in April?","John L. Brooklier","I think it's really -- I think what we tend to do is we tend to hold at second quarter. It's much harder to forecast on a 3- to 6-month basis where things are going to be, so we're basically holding it where we essentially ended the quarter. I don't think we've carved it out per segment, but I don't think they'd be radically different than some of the segments we've talked about today per Q2. Industrial Packaging, Polymers & Fluids would probably be the primary examples there.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And if I can just get one last Welding question in. You didn't mention anything about pricing. But if you've taken out prices yet this year, with material costs down, is there a price increase for the back half or maybe a price decrease?","John L. Brooklier","Price increase went into effect, I believe, 1st of April. Yes, April of this year. I wouldn't -- I don't -- I'm not -- I don't have knowledge of any additional price increases at this point in time.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then those price increases are sticking given -- even with the commodity prices coming down?","John L. Brooklier","Yes.","We're going to end it there at the top of the hour.

Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our third quarter financial results, and update you on our earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 fourth quarter and full year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2014 Form 10-K and second quarter 2015 Form 10-Q for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Aaron and good morning. In Q3, ITW delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion and earnings per share growth. In the quarter, ITW achieved 9% earnings per share growth, operating margin of just under 23%, and after-tax return on invested capital of 21.5%. In addition, free cash flow in the quarter was very strong at 126% of net income.","We were able to deliver these results despite the by now well known list of near-term headwinds confronting just about every U.S.-based industrial company: currency, sluggish business investment, and CapEx spending, the slowdown in China, et cetera. The key driver of our performance in the near term continues to be strong execution on the margin and return improvement focused elements of our Enterprise Strategy, which contributed to more than 100 basis points of margin expansion and 140 basis points of ROIC improvement in the quarter.","Since we began implementing our current strategy a little over two and a half years ago, we have expanded operating margins by 570 basis points and after-tax return on invested capital by 540 basis points. As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, activities across the company associated with our Business Structure Simplification initiative are tapering down with significant incremental benefits still to come.","Strategic Sourcing is now fully embedded in our operations and is delivering consistent above-plan benefits, and we're in the final stages of the portfolio management component of our Enterprise Strategy as product line simplification activities will start to moderate in 2016. As a result, and as we planned, beginning in 2016 we will be well positioned to shift our focus increasingly toward leveraging our much more differentiated higher quality business portfolio for accelerated organic growth.","Similar to the way we implemented these initiatives, we are in the early stages of applying a clearly defined and rigorous two-step growth framework to every one of our 84 (3:26) divisions that is designed to, first, prepare them for accelerated growth and, second, to have them deliver on it in a very focused 80\/20-like way. Our Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments are the farthest along in implementing this framework. Their success in accelerating organic growth through applying our growth framework is encouraging as we look to bring the rest of the company along over the next 12 months to 18 months. We will cover our growth framework and our transition to focus on growth in more detail at our Annual Investor Day in December.","Despite the long list of near-term external challenges, we continue to focus on positioning the company to take full advantage of the performance potential that was (4:06) within our highly differentiated business model over the long term. To that end, we have invested approximately $420 million in our businesses thus far in 2015, as we add capital equipment to expand capacity, launch new products, and simplify our businesses in order to focus them on our largest and most compelling growth opportunities.","ITW's business model is not capital intensive and, as a result, we have plenty of flexibility that allows us to both make significant investments in our businesses and return a meaningful share of our cash flow to our shareholders. In the third quarter, the board raised the dividend 13.4% and year-to-date we have now repurchased $2 billion of shares. As a reminder, we have more than $5 billion remaining on our share repo authorization.","Moving forward, we will continue to be highly disciplined in our approach to allocating capital to both share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. As we move through the back-end of year three of our Enterprise Strategy, we've made substantial progress in executing our strategy to position ITW for solid organic growth with best-in-class margins and returns and we remain solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2017 performance goals.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. As you saw this morning, ITW delivered another strong quarter. EPS was $1.39, an increase of 9% versus prior year, driven once again by strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives as Business Structure Simplification and Strategic Sourcing exceeded our expectations and contributed to record operating margin performance, and helped offset challenging end market conditions in some of our businesses. Operating margin improved 180 basis points to 22.7%, with 110 basis points of that improvement coming directly from our Enterprise Initiatives.","Revenues were down 9%, primarily due to currency headwinds and a 1% decline in organic revenue. Keep in mind that, as expected, the organic decline includes 1 percentage point of PLS. As you may recall, we're comparing against a pretty good organic performance of plus 3.5% in the year ago quarter.","When we look at our diverse business portfolio, it's a tale of two economies: industrial and consumer. We continue to see solid organic growth in our consumer-facing businesses, such as Automotive, Food Equipment, and parts of Specialty and Construction, which represents about 60% of our total revenues. In the quarter and year-to-date, these businesses are up 5% organically, so 60% of the company is growing at 5% in a tough environment. On the other hand, our industrial-facing businesses, like Welding, Test & Measurement\/Electronics, declined in the high single digits organic. That said, we continue to invest in all of our businesses, including those that serve the industry (7:06) economy, as we're confident that the CapEx cycle will eventually turn in our favor.","Strong cash generation is a hallmark of ITW and this quarter was no exception, with free cash flow of $644 million, 126% of net income. We expect a solid fourth quarter and remain firmly on track to meet or exceed our 100% cash conversion target for the year. Good progress on after-tax return on invested capital, now solidly above our long-term target of 20%-plus in the quarter and year-to-date.","So in summary, with revenues down 9%, ITW delivered 9% EPS growth along with record operating margin performance, record ROIC and strong cash flows. And just as important, we fully expect this positive momentum from Enterprise Initiatives to continue to contribute about 100 basis points of margin expansion going forward, including in 2016 and 2017, independent of volume growth. Needless to say, this positions ITW very well in the current environment and gives us confidence in meeting or exceeding our 2017 performance goals.","Revenue by geography on page five reflects the environment we just talked about. North America was down 2% as declines in Test & Measurement\/Electronics and Welding offset strength in Construction, up 7%; Food Equipment, up 6%; and Automotive, up 5%. EMEA was down 1% despite another strong double-digit performance by the Automotive team. Asia Pacific was down 4%, as China, which is less than 5% of revenues, was down 8% this quarter. Declines in Welding, Test & Measurement\/Electronics and Automotive were partially offset by solid growth in Construction products. Finally, South America was down 4%, as Brazil, which represents about 2% of total ITW sales, declined 7%.","Our emerging market exposure is fairly limited, and while the environment globally is a little more challenging, ITW is well positioned to offset end market conditions with strong margin performance, as you will see on the next page.","On page six, operating margin is once again the highlight of the quarter with 22.7% being an all time high for the company. Margin performance was strong across the board, that's four segments improved by 200 basis points or more. Construction was up 420 basis points; Food Equipment, up 320 basis points; Specialty Product, up 270 basis points; and Automotive up 200 basis points.","Volume declines in Test & Measurement\/Electronics, Welding and Polymers & Fluids led to lower operating margin in those three segments on a year-over-year basis. That said, these businesses are still operating at best in class margins, particularly Welding, which maintained 25% operating margin in the face of significant volume declines.","On the right side of the page, the number one driver of margin expansion this quarter was once again Enterprise Initiatives contributing 110 basis points, slightly better than expected. Price\/cost was favorable, 20 basis points, and lower restructuring versus prior year drove 70 basis points of the 90 basis points in the other category.","As Scott mentioned, the restructuring costs associated with Business Structure Simplification are starting to moderate, and we expect to spend $60 million to $70 million on restructuring this year. So overall, very good progress on sustainable margin improvement so far, and clear line of sight to further incremental margin opportunities going forward.","Turning to page seven, on the left side, you can see the operating margin by segment on a year-to-date basis, with 150 basis points of sustainable margin improvement so far this year. For some additional color by segment, let's start with Automotive OEM which had another strong quarter as organic revenue was up 5% on worldwide auto builds that were flat.","Europe continued to outperform auto builds with double-digit revenue growth. North America was up 5%, in line with auto builds, but excluding PLS, this region would have outperformed auto builds by approximately 300 basis points. As expected, China was down 5%, as global automotive manufacturers, where ITW has higher content, declined 15%, significantly more than domestic Chinese manufacturers. This implies about 500 basis points of penetration gains, very much in line with our past performance. And operating margin was 25.4%, an increase of 200 basis points.","In our Test & Measurement\/Electronics segment, organic revenue declined 11% in the quarter in a challenging demand environment for capital equipment and in the face of a good year ago quarter, above 5%. Lower volume caused operating margin for the segment to decrease 210 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter. Adding back the non-cash charges from the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, operating margin is above 20%. Food Equipment, also had a good year ago quarter, but organic growth was still up 3%, as North America led the way with equipment up 8% and service up 4%.","The team continues to do a very good job achieving above market growth across the portfolio through customer backed innovation. Internationally, equipment revenue was down 1%, compared to strong 8% growth in the year ago quarter. And record operating margin of 26.3% was up 320 basis points.","Polymers & Fluids on page nine was down 3%, with polymers down 8% partly due to a decline in the European offshore wind business. Fluids down 4% due to weak industrial MRO trends, while automotive aftermarket, which is more oriented towards the consumer, was a bright spot of 2% due to successful new product launches.","As discussed earlier, a tough quarter on the top line in Welding, down 10% organically, compared to a strong quarter, up 5% in the year ago. Weakness in North America, which represents about 75% of the segment's revenues was broad based, and organic revenue was down 8%. International was down 17%, primarily due to oil and gas and PLS of low margin business in Europe. As you can see from the margin performance, the team continues to do a very good job maintaining best in class margins supported by the 80\/20 focus on highly differentiated equipment, which represents approximately two-thirds of the business.","On slide 10, Construction Products had another good quarter on the top line with organic revenue growth of 4%. North America, which is about 40% of this segment, was up 7%, due to continued positive momentum in the renovation\/remodel hard and, to some extent, commercial. Europe was down 2% as we continue to focus on PLS and restructuring, activities that in the near term position the business for accelerated organic revenue growth with much improved margin performance. Asia Pacific increased 5%, with strong performance once again in Australia. Operating margin came in at a record 23.1%, an impressive 420 basis points of improvement.","In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat with growth in consumer packaging offset by PLS. North America was flat and international was down 1%. And operating margin improved significantly by 270 basis points to 24%.","On page 11, let's turn to the guidance. And we've updated the organic outlook for the demand levels that we're seeing in our businesses today. And as a result, we expect the year to be flat to down 1%. Due to the reduced revenue assumption, we're lowering our full year EPS guidance by 1%, or $0.05 at the midpoint, to $5.05 to $5.15, which is 9% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite the long list of external headwinds we talked about earlier. We also expect record operating margin of 21%-plus, and record after-tax ROIC of 20%-plus.","Turning to the fourth quarter, our EPS guidance is in the range of $1.15 to $1.25, which includes $0.08 of negative currency impact. We also saw some (15:29) last year that we don't expect to repeat this year. Based again on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be down 1% to 2%. We're confident that the positive momentum on our Enterprise Strategy and our proven operational capabilities position the company for continued strong performance. In fact, looking forward, we have good visibility to a significant portion of our total shareholder return target of 12% to 14%. With about 100 basis points of margin improvement from Enterprise Initiatives in each 2016 and again in 2017, along with disciplined cap allocation behind an attractive dividend and buyback and\/or acquisitions, we are more than halfway to our target without the benefit of organic growth.","With that, let me turn it back over to Aaron.","Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Michael. We'll now open the call to your questions. Please be brief so as to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question. And also please remember, one question and one follow-up question only.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question will be coming from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. (16:55) your line is open.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Michael, I like the way you broke out your business, and that 60% of your business was growing at about 5%, and 40% of your business was down about 10%. And clearly from an underlying market standpoint, you guys expect the negative 1% to negative 2% trends to continue. But if we get into 2016 and underlying trends continue to deteriorate, say, your business is down 2% to 3%, can you continue to get 100 basis points in Enterprise Initiatives in 2016?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so I think, Joe. So we're not going to get real specific in terms of guidance for 2016 as you would expect. The 100 basis points of margin improvement from Enterprise Initiatives is really independent of volume, so we would expect to get that even if revenues continue to be down in the 2% to 3% range. And I think you saw again this quarter that the decremental margins, which you would apply to those 2% to 3% revenue were once again really good in the quarter in that 30% range, so that's how I would think about it in the scenario you just laid out.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Now, that's helpful. And I guess maybe just a follow-on question, digging into one of the segments. Auto OEM for example was still really strong this quarter, but also noticed that the outgrowth in builds in North America and China didn't happen as we've seen in prior quarters. Was there any noise in the quarter that maybe drove the outgrowth lower? Or does your view on outgrowth in Auto change at all longer term?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, Joe, our view hasn't changed. I mean, historically, we've outperformed auto build to the tune to 400 basis points to 500 basis points, which we did again at the global level. What you're not seeing in the numbers in North America is that we actually have 300 basis points of product line simplification, so this is revenue that came out. If you add that back in, we outperformed auto builds by 300 basis points in North America.","In China, what you're seeing is that about two-thirds of our business in China is with the global auto OEMs, and that's where we have significantly higher content. And their builds were down about 15% in the quarter, but our business was only down 5%. And so we continued to outperform to the tune of about 500 basis points in terms of continued penetration gains in the quarter.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and what I would add in terms of just additional color on China is that given the sort of slowdown on build rates, what you see in the quarter is, as the OEMs lower order rates, you see a bit of a elevated level of the brakes coming on, which is sort of flowing through the supply lines and people adjusting to the lower build rate. So all in all, we were pretty happy with how we tracked in auto in the quarter in China, given all that was going on over there.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That makes sense. If I could maybe sneak one more in. Scott, just a broader question on...","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The backdrop just getting a little bit worse here and clearly the next step of the story for ITW is really kind of positioning the portfolio for growth. And so, any additional color that you can give us on the two-step program and your ability to really, from a timing standpoint, start to see some growth in your portfolio in light of a pretty tough economic backdrop?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we will spend some more time on that in December, as we talked about, but I think in general, I actually feel really good about \u2013 Michael talked about we have 60% of the company, net of the PLS, is growing 5% this year-to-date, and it's a combination of starting to do the kind of work we're talking about. So, I think it's a real mixed bag, as you look at the diversity of the portfolio right now, primarily because of some real pressure on the CapEx side in Welding and Test & Measurement. I think if you sort of net that away, we're actually throwing up some pretty good progress in terms of organic in the other parts of the company.","I think if \u2013 with a view that says oil and gas is probably not going to get a lot worse and may not recover for a while, but the negative goes away next year, we just hold those businesses where we are and we get the rest of the portfolio to continue to grow at the rates we're growing at, it may be accelerating a little bit. I think we're set up to certainly generate some incremental improvement next year.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I would just add, Joe, that the other thing, and Scott talked about this, that we expect our product line simplification activities to moderate, really beginning in 2016. And so, that reduced organic growth rate by 1 percentage point and that will be less of a headwind on organic growth next year.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Scott, you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but maybe if you can give us a bit more color on these industrial headwinds. And ITW is so broad-based, you do see so many different end markets. People are calling this an industrial recession. You wouldn't see it in your margins, but just in terms of the key verticals, any changes in customer behavior or project pushouts? It would be interesting how you are characterizing the slowdown.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I actually think \u2013 going back to earlier in the year, I think the underlying demand trends have been pretty steady \u2013 had been down, so again, we're talking about \u2013 in oil and gas piece of it, we're talking about more broadly from the standpoint of what we're experiencing, a slowdown in CapEx investment, generally. I think currency has a lot to do with that, at least in North America.","We haven't seen a lot of, let's say, things getting a lot worse over the last two quarters, two and a half quarters. I think things are sort of holding where they are at the bottom. They're certainly down a significant degree. Some of the change in the relative performance is a function more of the comps. We actually had two pretty strong quarters in those businesses in Q3 and (23:31). So we're not seeing a lot of what I would describe as further erosion, but a lot of sluggishness on the CapEx side.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would just add if you look at the revenue numbers and the double-digit declines in Welding and Test & Measurement\/Electronics this quarter, I mean, that is typically what we would expect to see in a recessionary environment. So I would just say what Scott said, it's hard to see that we continue to deteriorate much further from where we are right now.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. And then, just to switch gears over on the Construction Products side, and again I will always use your data points and weigh those higher than I would, let's say the ABI [Architecture Billings Index], which was back up over 50, how are you characterizing your opportunities across non-res today? And then, I just have to call out those are very impressive margins for this quarter in that segment.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, thank you. I mean, I think the Construction team has been working for the last two and a half years on implementing BSS in Sourcing and you're seeing some terrific progress. If you had told that team two years ago margins are going to be solidly in the low to mid 20%s, I think everybody would have signed up for those types of margins.","So just on Construction, specifically, what you saw in the quarter, North America, up 7%, really led by renovation\/remodel, up double-digit. So again, back to the consumer-oriented, consumer-facing businesses, residential was flat to down slightly in the quarter, and commercial was up slightly; but really the big driver here was on the renovation and remodel side.","And just quickly globally, Europe, the focus there is still very much on restructuring; so quite a bit of PLS, again, in the quarter. France was actually positive. You don't hear those two words combined too often, France and growth; but France was positive. And then, in Asia Pacific, Australia, another really solid performance, up 5% in the Construction business.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But non-res overall, flat to a little bit better (25:54).","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Correct.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mig Dobre of R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, everyone. Quick question on margin, and I think someone tried to get at this earlier as well. Pretty impressive performance, but what I'm kind of looking is to where margins are expanding, they're in really the segments with pretty strong end markets: Automotive, Food Equipment, Construction, et cetera. As we look forward, what sort of needs to happen in terms of your own internal action in order to drive margin expansion in some of the segments that have been lagging? Are we sort of reliant, still, on these segments that have been driving margin expansion to continue that process into 2016, or can we actually see some of these other segments work as well?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think, Mig, if you go back to the last earnings call, I think we showed the progress on margins since we started the Enterprise Strategy, and there really are no laggards here. I mean, we've made substantial improvement across all of our businesses. What you saw this quarter was a little bit of an anomaly with some volume pressure leading to lower margins in three of our businesses. But if you look at \u2013 underlying that, there's still 100 basis points of margin expansion from the kind of the self-help from the Enterprise Initiatives in those businesses. And we would expect that to continue.","Obviously, volume helps, but we're not counting on it and we feel good about still having another 100 basis points of margin expansion across the company in 2016 and 2017. And I'll just point out, this quarter, 180 basis points of margin expansion with more than half, 110 basis points of that, coming from things that are largely within our own control. So we would expect all of our businesses, Mig, to continue to make progress over the next two years here, just the way we had planned it out when we embarked on the Enterprise Strategy three years ago.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, maybe sticking with Welding, going to your North American commentary, mentioning broad weakness there. I guess I'm trying to maybe get better clarity in terms of what you're seeing by end market, and also potentially, the cadence, if you can comment on that, in terms of demand or orders through the quarter.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so Mig, nothing unusual in terms of the cadence through the quarter. So we didn't see trends deteriorate or improve. I think if you look at Welding down 10% in the quarter, about half of that decline came from oil and gas. About 4 points of that came from the industrial side, so that's where you'll pick up heavy equipment, some of the mining, agriculture. And then the commercial business actually held in there, down 1 percentage point out of the 10%. So nothing surprising and very consistent with what you're hearing across the board.","I will just point out that \u2013 and I made the point in the script, that two-thirds of our business is equipment, because that's where 80\/20 will tell you, that's where the margins are. It's a much more differentiated product. And so when you are in this part of the CapEx cycle, you will see, at least in the near term, some larger declines on the equipment side than on the consumable side. But I think if you look then at the margin performance of Welding again, in the quarter and year-to-date, it really shows why we're focused on the equipment side. But you will see some different growth trends in consumables versus the equipment side. So I just wanted to point that out.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Sure. Is there any way you can comment on consumables specifically in terms of volumes there?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, it's about a third of the business and consumables were flat in North America, down slightly outside of the U.S. and Asia Pacific and Europe.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I appreciate it. Thank you and good luck.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. And Scott, I think you put it quite well when you mentioned two-speed economy, consumer versus industrial. But I thought your comments about relatively steady trends was interesting, because given that it looked like broader industrial activity stepped down in September versus the trend line for the quarter. So I'm wondering, did you see a significantly weaker September versus what you normally see? And perhaps you could make some comments on what you're seeing so far in October.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we did not see any change in order rates in September relative to the overall quarter, and October it's a little too early to tell.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Haven't heard anything. If there was something major going on already, we'd have heard about it, but...","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's...","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","(31:18) this early in the quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sure. I understand that. But it just seems that the trend you're referring to is a little bit different to what we're hearing elsewhere, but understand that. And then, on, obviously, very strong margin, in light of the volumes, so congratulations on that. Just maybe, Michael, on the SG&A. SG&A stepped down quite a bit from 2Q to 3Q, so I'm wondering was there something that drove that? Is that just Enterprise Initiatives kicking in or is there some elements of discretionary savings in this quarter?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's really all of the above. A big part of it is currency, but also a continued impact from Enterprise Initiatives and then just discretionary cost management are the main drivers here.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO. You may proceed.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, guys, how is it going?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just two ones quick. I wonder, is less PLS, going forward, is that going to stunt the rate of margin improvement a little bit?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Unanimous. No, I mean, I think PLS certainly has contributed in terms of improving the margins of the portfolio...","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But less in terms of the cost takeout that we get...","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","By taking these lower profit product lines.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right, right.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And we take out the lower margin product lines and all the costs associated with that, so it helped. but as PLS moderates, it doesn't impact margins in a significant way.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then I guess as you get more organic growth, the incremental margins on that are much higher than other businesses?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, that's correct. Yes.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Can you also give us a quick comment if you're seeing acquisition prices, are they starting to improve? Is that setting up over the next couple of years to be a more attractive use of capital?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't know if I could say, Joel, that things have changed in terms of pricing. If I can just make a broader comment on capital allocation, I think as you saw this quarter, this business model generates a significant amount of free cash flow and we have a strong balance sheet and we continue to be very disciplined. Our priority number one is invest in our businesses for growth and productivity, and we're doing that in a significant way.","We raised \u2013 the board raised the dividend, 13% this quarter and then the balance, which is a significant number, is available for external investments, acquisitions, and\/or share repurchases. And our view of acquisitions has not changed from what we laid out at the investor day a year ago. They still play an important role. I would just make a comment that we're looking at a number of things, nothing imminent on the acquisition front and we'll continue to keep you posted on that as we go forward.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","First on price\/cost, it was in line with your expectations. I'm just wondering within that, is it really as stable as it seems or did you see some price erosion that was offset by lower costs?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I think, Andy, it really is in terms of our ability to maintain and get price, nothing has changed. I think on the cost side, we're starting to see a little bit of favorability on the material costs side, as well as in resins and in metals. And some of that gets passed on to the customer, but some of that is flowing through. And we've been very steady in terms of 20 basis points, I think, every quarter this year, and we would expect to be able to maintain that going forward.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael. And then I'd like to ask a little bit of a bigger-picture question here. Welding operating margin performance, even though it's stepped down a little bit on steeper organic decline, it's holding up pretty well. Does that give you any increased confidence that maybe the margin performance for overall ITW might be a little more resilient in the next recession than what occurred in the 2008-2009 with the 400 basis point drop (36:09)?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, definitely. I mean I think you look at the decremental margins in some of our businesses that were down this quarter, and the really strong performance out of Welding, I think that suggests that as we go through this Enterprise Strategy, we have a really high-quality, highly differentiated, diverse business portfolio, and I would argue we are as well positioned if not better than ever before in the event of a more significant downturn or even a recession.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. You may proceed.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Two questions. One on the material cost, back to that, I know you had the 20 bps tailwind which was what you expected, but the price\/cost, was it more pronounced, the benefit, was that equally spread across the different segments, or was a couple of the segments more pronounced? Because I look at some of your margins in some of your businesses and they're just like Food having a 26% and change margin. That's just, relative to your peers, it's impressive.","And then I guess my second question is more bigger picture, again, you talked about your mix between consumer and industrial, 60%\/40%. I guess when you're evaluating acquisitions right now, do you sort of think the consumer\/industrial mix is the right mix? And also in your evaluating acquisitions, is there any appetite for acquiring businesses with more of a recurring earning stream, or longer cycle type businesses? Thanks.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, so why don't I do the price\/cost and maybe Scott, if you want to comment on the M&A question. I think what we're seeing including in Food Equipment, that a big driver of price here is the ability to launch new products that solve some challenging problems for some pretty sophisticated customers, and I think you're seeing that certainly in Food Equipment. You're seeing it in Welding, you're seeing it in Automotive across the portfolio. So that's really more a driver than anything else. I'd say across the portfolio, really good performance from a price standpoint, and nothing unusual in the quarter. And then maybe, Scott, on the M&A side.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the question relates again to our thinking around portfolio construction. I think the way we think about it is our most important job is to make great choices about owning and investing in businesses where this business model has great potential to generate long-term, sustainable competitive advantage, so we're not trying to think a lot harder beyond that.","We own great businesses that really fit our business model. We generate great margins, great returns on capital. Those businesses then, based on the margin profile, are very resilient when they're under pressure. So, we have no targets in terms of industrial versus consumer. The 60\/40 mix is today a function of the seven businesses that we obviously went through a very rigorous portfolio review, concluded that those seven are great fits with the portfolio strategy that I just talked about, it's 60\/40 today in some respects, because of the declines in those industrial businesses, so that mix is probably more like 50\/50 when it's normalized, but that's more a byproduct of the decision-making process than necessarily any specific target.","So we're well balanced. I think if you look at the resilience in terms of the overall company and we're still growing earnings through a time when there's some real challenges and pressures out there. So there's some real strength in having the ability to select from a number of different industries that have different attributes.","And then on the recurring revenue, I think we're very comfortable in businesses where we have great recurring revenues with the Food Equipment with service and equipment, but we also have other businesses where we're largely playing one side or the other. Automotive is an all consumable business. I think again, it goes back from our standpoint to the margin profile and how differentiated those businesses are, how well they fit our business model. And we have no sort of requirement around trying to mix recurring versus nonrecurring as much. So we want to be in industries where the products we make really do something meaningful for the customer and are areas where we can really do something unique and special for those customers.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys, good morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to ask you on the Automotive business, your European exposure. Can you talk about who your largest OEMs are there? And do you have any exposure to VW? And what's your outlook or your assessment of what might happen in the automotive sector in Europe going forward?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, they are \u2013 VW's a customer. It's a nice relationship. It is not a dominant relationship by any stretch, and any share loss there. We're pretty broad based among all the globals, so to the extent they have run into some \u2013 there's some things that happened as a result of what's going on right now, we're certainly well positioned to the extent other OEMs pick up any share that they lose. I think we're pretty agnostic, overall.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, can you just talk a little bit about Welding and Test & Measurement, your long-term growth targets for those businesses? Are those under review right now? Are you still confident that you can grow those businesses as you thought you could two years or three years ago?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think we still like the fundamentals a lot. We've talked about Welding in the past. That's a business that we've grown at right around 9% organic compounded since the early 1990s when we got into the business, and whether from here forward that's 7% instead of 9%, we'll see as we go forward; but I think we have a lot of conviction in the fundamentals there. And likewise on Test & Measurement, there's some positions we have there that are really tied to global manufacturing \u2013 in quality in global manufacturing that on a long-term basis we still believe very much have the potential to generate organic growth at or above the overall Enterprise target.","So I think we're still very bullish on the long-term prospects in both. I think this currency \u2013 this short-term change in relative currency rates, as you would expect it, to the extent you're a U.S. manufacturer exporting any meaningful percentage of your output from your plant, either that's gone to Europe or you're worried about it going to Europe. So I think there's a lot of sort of logic around the fact that the spending environment right now is very sluggish.","And I think, frankly, on the European side, there's enough surplus capacity over there where you're not seeing that investment pick up, yet, given the kind of recessionary environment they've been in for the last two years or three years. So all that will shake out over the next 12 months or 18 months, and I think we'll be certainly seeing much better performance from those two businesses. Both are \u2013 look at the margin profiles. You can barely differentiate it; great niches in great industries. So we'd love for them to be doing better right now, but we're certainly not any less enthusiastic about their fit and their ability to perform for us at a high level long term.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. I will turn it over. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Hi, good morning.","Operator","Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thank you. Just a quick question, trying to think of the parameters around the balance sheet usage in cash flow; obviously been drawing down the shareholder equity a lot the last couple years. It's been cut in half. The net debt is obviously up a bit as well. So I look at net debt to capital of 37%, but that said, your net debt to EBITDA \u2013 trailing EBITDA is only 1.4. When we think about use of balance sheet, maybe even above and beyond, obviously, just using the cash flow, what are the parameters we should be thinking about where you start to get a little uncomfortable with the leverage, either be it debt to cap or trailing EBITDA? Just give us some views around cash flow (45:23)","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think, Steve (sic) [Dave], I'll go back to what we said earlier is that, as you pointed out, this is a company and a business model that generates a lot of cash. I think we are very comfortable with our current leverage at 2.3 times debt to EBITDA. It supports a really strong top-tier credit rating; gives us access to credit at very favorable terms under current conditions. And it still gives us some flexibility in terms of being opportunistic around the things we talked about, which is M&A as well as share repurchases, which obviously we've leaned in to quite a bit, as you mentioned. So I think we're certainly not nervous when we run these scenarios in terms of what a recession might look like and the performance of the company.","As you know, we generate even more cash flow in a downturn, and so we feel very good about where we're at in any scenario here with our current capital structure. And going forward, as we said earlier, we'll continue to be very disciplined in terms of capital allocation.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","I guess more pointed, though, I'm not necessarily even looking at the downside scenario. I'm just thinking if you're looking to utilize the balance sheet, maybe add a layer to the story here that 2017 on the margin improvement isn't that far away now, right? So (46:51)...","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, okay. I mean, I think, as you see \u2013 what will certainly happen, if you look at our overall debt levels will continue to go up as our EBITDA grows, right, if that's what you're trying to get at. And so, we're very comfortable with that and at this point we don't have any plans to, here in the third quarter, change the way we think about our capital structure and that we're comfortable with the leverage we have on a gross and on a net basis. And we review it frequently and, if things change, we'll certainly keep you updated on that; but for now, I wouldn't expect any significant changes.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","So just think of it as \u2013 and you were using total debt, I was using net debt, but the idea's whatever leverage you have now, just think of that as how you'll look to run the business over the next 12 months to 18 months?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think that's a good way to think about it. Yes.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","That's helpful. Thank you.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Scott and Michael, you both mentioned that you're on track to hit your 2017 performance goals. Should we assume that that still includes 200 basis points of organic growth above global GDP? And if so, how much of that outgrowth do you expect to come from your end markets growing faster than GDP versus your internal initiatives?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the answer to the first part is yes, and the answer to the second part is it's our business is outgrowing their underlying markets. So we've got, in the markets that we are operating in across all seven of our businesses, in every case, we think the fundamentals in terms of are they at least GDP growers at the market level? Absolutely. Some will certainly grow faster than others.","But the real work is on the positioning that we've been doing the last couple of years to get in front of the highly differentiated pieces of these larger global end markets and position ourselves to really leverage these highly differentiated positions with additional penetration. So Auto's a good example, Food Equipment's a good example and also crank up the new product pipeline, which is what we've been in the process of doing for the last 12 months or 18 months.","So we're going to generate that result more from us growing faster than the underlying markets that we're in, if that \u2013 hopefully I'm saying that clearly \u2013 than we're trying to pick markets that we think are going to grow faster than GDP.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I was just trying to get a sense of whether you're assuming that you have some sort of confidence that your markets are not going to be declining, that they'll maybe be at least kind of flat; because I would expect (49:45)...","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that was a big part of our portfolio review going back to the beginning of this Enterprise Strategy is we wanted to be in \u2013 we didn't want to certainly be investing in markets where there was just fundamental pressure in terms of shrinking \u2013 pressures on the underlying markets. And I think across all seven businesses, we feel really good that we're in industries that have certainly some really solid long-term support in terms of growth rates of at least GDP. Some of them may be a little bit better over time. And then our job is to grow faster than the underlying market growth rates.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then North America has slipped into a decline year-over-year, as you mentioned, due to the industrial side. What indications or signals do you receive from your businesses about the direction of North American demand broadly? I mean, should we be assuming that the industrial side and maybe some tougher comparisons are going to keep North America in negative territory for a few quarters or can that flip back around?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think so. I think ultimately right now, we're going through the year-on-year comps, the underlying demand rates, if you break it down to kind of daily average order rates, even in the industrial businesses have been relatively steady now for two and a half quarters. So I think, at a minimum, we take \u2013 next year, we take the negative away of the contraction. We're not necessarily seeing anything yet that's saying it's going to start to turn the other way. But certainly the declines this year, and Michael talked about even we're running into some comps in the Q3 and Q4 where we actually had pretty good performance in those businesses last year on a relative basis, that is on a year-on-year percentage comparison probably making it look like it's getting worse, but underlying the demand has been pretty flat.","So I think things seem to be holding pretty steady right now, and as we move into next year, the comp issue goes away and if nothing else, if we're flat instead of down 10% in the industrials, obviously that's a net positive and we keep the commercial side going. There's another, as Michael said earlier, 60% of the company growing at right around 5% gross. And then we get at least 0.5 point pickup from the decline in product line simplification. So I think if things hold where they are, we're in a pretty good spot to start to see some positive movement on the top line next year, organically.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My question is in Test & Measurement. I think in your presentation, you called out the purchase accounting charges. I wonder if you can help us quantify those. And do you see any of those recurring in the fourth quarter?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We had a bit of an industrial accident. Could you repeat the \u2013 we missed the second half of your question. Sorry.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. Do you have purchase accounting charges in Test & Measurement? How much were they this quarter, specifically, and next quarter do we get (53:10)?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah so I think if you go to, well, the last page, the appendix page in the earnings slides, you'll see that we lay it out for each one of our seven businesses, and also at the total ITW level. And so you can see there, Test & Measurement\/Electronics, 410 basis points, and then the other significant one due to recent acquisitions is Polymers & Fluids. So if you add that back, that's 490 basis points. And at the ITW level, there's 180 basis points here of non-cash charges included in the operating margin of 22.7%.","Over time, as we amortize the intangibles, that will go down. Q4 will be a lot like Q3, but over time, over a longer period of time, you would expect that impact to continue to go down, as it has done this year. So that's a good way of looking at it.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Okay, great. And then sticking with Test & Measurement, you mentioned that these businesses were part of a global capital spending cycle. I wonder if you could tell us where you think we are? Are we bottoming out now? Or is it similar to some of the other industrial, where \u2013 that you should be steady and easier comps as we head to 2016?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think Scott gave you kind of the broader view of that. I would just \u2013 tying it back to the guidance, I mean, as you know, we assume current demand levels with some adjustment for seasonality, so we're not expecting, in the near term, a pickup in the CapEx cycle. On the other hand, we're also not expecting it to further deteriorate, from \u2013 when we look at current revenue per day inside these businesses, that's what we're using to project forward, so hopefully that answers your question.","Now, I will just make the point that since you asked about Test & Measurement, that business was up 5% in the year ago quarter, and the comparisons get a lot easier here in the fourth quarter, so you wouldn't expect as steep a decline in Q4 as you saw in the third quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eli Lustgarten of Longbow. Your line is open.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you very much. A quick question on the guidance change. Can you indicate, when you took down the top line and the earnings of where it's impacting the numbers, I mean can you give an idea what changed to cause you to take down the guidance fourth quarter? I know it's a current business run that's going on, but can you give us some indication of what across the board changed? Or anything specific cause the change? And whether \u2013 if it continues into the first half, are we going to be talking 2016, first half \u2013 second half comparison to the first half will be continuing a weaker run rate and then have some improvements as the comparisons get easier?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so the guidance change for Q4 is pretty straightforward. So it's basically when we update the revenue for the current demand levels, that leads to a lower revenue number, and applying a decremental margin to those revenues leads to $0.08 of EPS impact, and so if you look at the...","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Where is that? I understand the current run rate, but is that broad based across all the businesses or is there something specific that changed that causes the reduction?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, that's broad based across the business. Every business we look at it the same way and then at the enterprise level, it adds up to a lower organic growth rate, and then with the decremental margin on that, that's the $0.08. So that's really the only change here.","As you'll see, currency gets a little bit easier here in Q4 and then hopefully next year, we won't have as much headwind on currency next year. Certainly at current rates, that's the case, and so that will help out next year. But again, we're not ready to talk about demand in 2016 and organic growth in 2016 yet. We'll have to save that for our Analyst Day in December.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I guess what I'm looking at, if you're adjusting the things downward in the fourth quarter, I mean, it's unlikely to have much of a change, at least in the first part of 2016. So I mean the emphasis of growth has to be back-end loaded. That's really what I'm asking for next year.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not necessarily.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right. I look forward to December 4. Anyway, thank you.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning. First, just on inventory conditions through the channel and general assessment on kind of how lean those inventories may be and whether or not, as destock has been an issue over the course of the year, whether you see that starting to ease or you have line of sight into when that eases.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, in the business where we go through distribution, we don't have a really good handle on inventory levels across our very fragmented customer base, and so I don't think I have a good answer for you on that one.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then maybe I guess shifting over and as you talk about the business on the industrial side and the consumer side, if you can talk about price trends within those kind of two splits of the business. And whether or not maybe the consumer side in holding up, you've seen some pricing there that's been (59:23) offsetting any recent pressure on the industrial side.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, there's really no significant difference. I mean, again back to what I said earlier with \u2013 the big driver of price here is new products that get launched that solve some pretty challenging problems for sophisticated customers, and then you see that \u2013 Food Equipment's a good example and Automotive and others. That's really the main driver of price here. And it's very similar trends across industrial-facing and consumer-facing businesses as we sit here today.","Joe J.

Joining me on today's call is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Ron Kropp. Scott, Ron and I will discuss our solid Q1 financial results, our long-term strategic initiatives and our 2013 forecast. As always, we will take your questions later in the call.","Now, here's the agenda for today's call.

[Operator Instructions] And we have allocated 1 hour for today's call.","A few housekeeping items. First, remember, this presentation contains our financial forecast for full year '13, for 2013 second quarter and other forward-looking statements identified on this slide.","We refer you to the company's 2012 10-K for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations.","Moving to the next slide, the telephone replay for this conference call is (800) 839-1334. No passcode is necessary to access the replay. And the replay will be available through midnight of May 7, 2013. Now, let me introduce our CEO, Scott Santi. Scott?","E. Scott Santi","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, organic growth came in about 100 basis points below what we expected heading into the quarter, largely due to sluggish demand in the capital equipment components of our product portfolio, particularly earlier in the quarter.","While equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter, consumable revenue at down 1% largely came in, in line with our expectations. We did see noticeable improvement in demand rates for equipment products on both a sequential basis and in comparison to the prior year as we moved through the quarter, particularly in March. Daily revenue rates for equipment products were up 13% in March versus the average for the quarter overall.","Despite some top line challenges, our profitability performance was very solid in Q1. We delivered above forecast operating EPS of $0.96, and operating margins came in at 16.5%, 60 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. This operating margin improvement was due to a combination of strong tactical cost management from our operating leadership and the early-stage benefits from our portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing initiatives.  Benefits from these initiatives contributed 40 basis points to overall margin performance in the quarter.","We continued to make good progress in our 3 enterprise initiatives in the quarter. With regard to portfolio management, we announced the strategic review of our Industrial Packaging segment earlier in the quarter. In addition, we've moved more than $600 million of noncore revenues to discontinued operations. With these 2 moves, we have largely completed the process of identifying the core businesses that will constitute our faster growing and more profitable portfolio moving forward.","With regard to business structure simplification, we continued to drive alignment and execution across the organization in the quarter. During the quarter, I visited a number of our newly scaled-up businesses; and in each case, I was extremely impressed with both the level of progress made and the level of enthusiasm for and commitment to this initiative by our on-the-ground operating leadership. We came away from these interactions even more convinced that the strategic and operational benefits associated with simplifying and scaling up our divisional operating structure will be considerable over the medium and long term for the company.","As to strategic sourcing, we continued to resource the initiative and drive implementation. We hired a Chief Procurement Officer earlier in the quarter, and her early view is much like ours, that the potential to better leverage our direct and indirect spend is both considerable and achievable. A number of category-specific strategic sourcing initiatives and programs are actively being worked and executed across the company.","Finally, let me reiterate our 2017 enterprise financial performance goals, and those are: Organic growth of 200 basis points above global industrial production, operating margins pretax of 20% plus and after-tax returns on invested capital also at 20% plus. Overall, we've made good progress towards these goals in a pretty challenging environment in Q1. More to come.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Ron.","Ronald D. Kropp","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our first quarter operating results, I wanted to walk through some reporting changes in our financials beginning this quarter.","As Scott just mentioned, we moved several businesses to discontinued operations. The larger businesses moved include a transportation-related business and a construction distribution business. The businesses moved represent more than $600 million in 2013 forecasted revenue, with an operating margin of approximately 7%. This move to discontinued operations reduced our diluted EPS from continuing operations by $0.01 for the first quarter and our full year EPS forecast by $0.07.","As we discussed in January, we've also aligned our reporting segments to better match our portfolio management strategy. The quick highlights are, that we changed our Transportation segment to a pure automotive OEM segment and moved our automotive aftermarket business into our Polymers & Fluids segment.","We've formed a new segment that combines our Test & Measurement business and our Electronic business. Our welding business is now a standalone segment. And the former, All Other segment, is now called Specialty Products, which primarily includes our consumer packaging businesses, as well as our appliance business.","We also modified our methodology on how we allocate corporate-held expenses to our segments. We previously allocated all such expenses to our segments. We've -- we're now allocating a fixed overhead charge to each segment based on each segment's revenues. Expenses not charged to the segments are reported separately in our results as unallocated.","Our historical P&L results and segment data have been restated for the discontinued operations and have also been adjusted for the segment changes I just mentioned. The appendix of our presentation includes 2001 -- 2011 and quarterly 2012 restated financial data for the total company as well as for each segment.","Lastly, as we also discussed in January, because we retained a 49% interest in the divested Wilsonart business, prior period results will not be restated, and the ongoing equity interest will be reported as income from continuing operations. To allow for like-to-like comparisons to 2013, we will be presenting our 2012 results on a pro forma or non-GAAP basis, which excludes the 2012 operating results of the Decorative Surfaces business, as well as the fourth quarter 2012 gain on divestiture and equity interest. Q1 2012 comparisons exclude the Decorative Surfaces business operating results.","As part of our first quarter 2013, we also recognized a onetime pretax gain of $30 million related to an acquisition of the majority 51% interest in the consumer packaging joint venture. We've excluded this onetime gain when we're discussing our EPS performance for the first quarter.","Finally, on to the highlights for the first quarter. Total revenues decreased 8%, primarily due to the impact of Decorative Surfaces. Excluding the 2012 revenue of Decorative Surfaces, revenues declined 1.8%, driven by organic revenue declines in both Europe and North America.","Operating income was $660 million, which was higher than our 2012 pro forma operating income by $8 million, representing an increase of 1.2%. As a result, operating margins of 16.5% were 60 basis points higher than last year.","Diluted income per share from continuing operations was $1.01 on a GAAP basis. Excluding the onetime $30 million pretax gain I mentioned, diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.96, which represents a 7.9% growth over our pro forma 2012 and was $0.01 above our forecasted EPS midpoint.","Our 8% revenue decline in the first quarter was primarily due to the following factors: Divestitures, primarily Decorative Surfaces, reduced revenues by 6.4%. Base revenues were down 2.7%, with North American-based revenues decreasing 1.9%, and mixed international-based revenues that overall were down 3.5% year-over-year. Europe declined 6%, with impacts across virtually all of our businesses. Our Asia businesses grew 0.5%, led by strong growth in both China and India.","As we look at product mix, organic revenues were down approximately 1% in our consumables businesses, while we saw a 6% decline in our equipment businesses as businesses remained cautious on their capital spending. However, as Scott mentioned, we started to see some improvement in equipment sales as we ended the first quarter. Acquisitions added 1.3% to revenue growth, while currency translation was virtually flat.","Operating margins for the first quarter of 16.5% were 60 basis points higher than Q1 2012. Base business margins were up 30 basis points from last year, led by a 100 basis point improvement on the non-volume side. A key driver was the 40 basis point improvement from the results of our enterprise initiatives, largely related to our business structure simplification activities, as well as some benefits from sourcing leverage.","We also had a 40 basis point improvement from strong overhead cost management. Price cost favorability improved margins 30 basis points. These are partially offset by a 70 basis point decline from lower sales volumes across the majority of our businesses. In addition, total operating margins also benefited from a 20 basis point improvement due to lower restructuring costs in the first quarter versus last year.","Overall, despite our first quarter organic revenue decline from softer North American and European end markets, our bottom line operating margin improved versus last year. We grew our operating margin 60 basis points as we started to see some benefits from our enterprise initiatives, while continuing to manage overhead costs in a cautious macroeconomic environment.","Looking at working capital and cash flow. Accounts receivable DSO was just under 63 days, which was a slight improvement versus last year. And inventory months on hand improved slightly to 1.8.","ROIC for the first quarter was 14.9%, which was a 60 base improvement versus the first quarter of last year. Our ROIC continues to be well above our cost of capital and is a key metric for us. As Scott mentioned, we expect the end result from our enterprise strategy will be an ROIC above 20% by 2017.","Net cash provided from operating activities was $366 million for the first quarter with capital expenditures of $89 million, resulting in free operating cash flow of $277 million.","Our cash generated was 16% higher versus the first quarter of 2012 despite over $1.7 billion in revenue divested over the last year. For the year, we expect conversion of free operating cash flow to be close to 100% of income from continuing operations.","Turning to capital structure. We continue to focus on capital allocation priorities as follows: Our first priority continues to be organic investments, especially focused on our key growth initiatives. Examples of our organic investments include R&D spending, additional investments in manufacturing capacity and restructuring projects which have long-term margin benefits.","Our next capital priority is dividends. Note that our normal January dividend of $174 million was paid on December 31 last year to allow our shareholders to benefit from the lower 2012 dividend tax rate. Our current dividend yield continues to be about 2.5%.","Any excess capital after organic investments and dividend is used for external investments, either share repurchases or acquisitions. We evaluate the allocation between these investments based on the best risk-adjusted returns and assess acquisition targets by incorporating our portfolio management criteria.","During the first quarter, we had $366 million in share repurchases. As we look ahead through 2013, we have increased our share repurchase forecast from free operating cash flow to, at least, $850 million versus the $500 million we communicated in January. In addition, we intend to use any U.S. after-tax divestiture proceeds for share repurchases as well.","As of the end of the first quarter, we have approximately $1.5 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under our current buyback program. We also utilized $56 million for acquisitions during the quarter, with continued focus on our growth platforms in emerging markets. Our portfolio strategy incorporates 2 key criteria as we continue to assess acquisition targets: accelerated growth spaces and a strong differentiation potential.","Lastly, our Q1 debt-to-capital ratio is 33%, while our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA remained constant at 1.5x. Our cash balance overseas is nearly $2.7 billion, and we have plenty of debt capacity to make additional investments.","I will now turn it back over to John, who will provide more detail on the operating results by geography and by individual segments.","John L. Brooklier","Thank you, Ron. Let me take just a few moments to review our first quarter geographic trends. Ron touched on these a little bit earlier. But excluding the impact of currency in 2012 revenue from the former debt services segment, total company revenues declined 2% in the quarter.","As Ron noted earlier, total company organic revenues decreased approximately 3%, with North American organic revenues declining 2% and international organic revenues decreasing 4%.","Most notably, EMEA and Europe declined 6%, and Asia Pacific grew 1%. The real positive for us in Q1 took place in China and Brazil where our organic revenues grew 10% and 3%, respectively.","For our Q1 segment results, please note that 6 out of our 8 segments produced operating margin improvement in the quarter, ranging from automotive OEMs, 10 basis points of improvement, to construction products, 320 basis points of improvement. Our 60 basis points of total company operating margin improvement was 40 basis points higher from what we initially forecasted in January for the first quarter.","Also, as part of our portfolio segmentation, we have added an adjusted operating margin metric, which excludes intangible amortization and other noncash acquisition accounting charges from operating income. As certain segments, primarily Test & Measurement and Electronics, as well as Polymers And Fluids, have grown largely through acquisitions, we believe adjusted operating margin show a more consistent comparability across our businesses.","Now, let's take a closer look at our 8 reporting segments. And we'll start with Test & Measurement and Electronics. This segment was largely a tale of 2 different levels of customer demand. Test & Measurement business produced worldwide organic revenue growth of 2%, and our flagship, Instron led the way in the quarter as customer demand for structural testing equipment and software was strong.","On the electronics component side, organic revenues were essentially flat as the contamination control and pressure-sensitive adhesive businesses offset organic revenue decline by our electrostatic business.","Organic revenues for the electronics assembly business, formerly known as the PC board-related operations, declined at a double-digit rate as the semiconductor industry slowed and customers curtailed their spend on capital equipment.","The better news was that operating margins improved 120 basis points year-over-year, largely due to strong management of overheads and lower restructuring spend versus last year. In automotive OEM, it was our fastest-growing organic revenue segment in the quarter as our innovative product penetration outperformed auto builds in all, and I emphasize, all major geographies.","In North America, our automotive organic revenues grew 3%, outpacing a North American auto build increase of only 1%. And while our European organic revenues declined 2%, please note the European auto builds fell 8%. Asia Pacific organic revenues increased a strong 24% due to ITW's growing product penetration amid a very robust auto build environment in China. Notably, our Chinese-based auto businesses produced a strong organic growth rate of 46% versus a Q1 auto build increase of 10% in China. So clearly, very good trends going on in the automotive OEM sector.","In our Polymers and Fluids segment, organic revenues were again defined by our organic -- ongoing product line simplification, what we call, PLS, in the quarter and weaker industrial production metrics.","Worldwide polymers in hygiene and fluids, organic revenues declined 8% and 4%, respectively, as targeted low-volume, low-margin customers continue to leave the portfolio. This sorting-out process will likely continue as we implement portfolio and business structure simplification initiatives within the segment. In auto aftermarket, organic revenues declined 6% due to the ongoing impact of the loss of a major customer and other targeted PLS activities.  While operating margins declined 30 basis points, nearly all that was due to higher 2013 restructuring costs associated with PLS activities.","In the Food Equipment segment, ongoing weakness in capital equipment sales was again evident in the quarter. Total Food Equipment North America's organic revenues declined 1% as equipment sales fell 3%. Demand for warewash equipment for small restaurants, as well as slicing and mixing equipment, was soft in the quarter.","Total Food Equipment's international's organic revenues declined 4%, with equipment sales decreasing 9%. A fall-off in demand for cooking or refrigeration equipment in France, Italy and the U.K. contributed to the organic revenue decline.","The better news in the segment continued to be our service businesses, where organic revenues in North America and international grew 3% and 4%, respectively.","In our welding segment, our organic revenue decline was tied to a slowdown in worldwide industrial production in heavy equipment activity. Please note, however, that welding faced a very, very difficult comparison from 1 year ago when organic revenues grew 19%. Worldwide Welding's organic revenues fell 6% in the quarter with organic revenues from North America and international declining 6% and 5%, respectively.","In North America, the industrial portion of the business was faced with lower order rates from key heavy equipment OEMs. And internationally, our organic revenue decline was mainly due to slower than expected end market recovery in China, as well as our organic -- I should say, our ongoing strategic exit from a very weak shipbuilding end market.","Operating margins declined 200 basis points, but please recall, they were down from historically high operating margins of 28% a year ago.","In construction products, organic revenues declined as major weakness in Europe outweighed modest improvement in North America. In European construction, our organic revenues declined 10% due to weakness in our primary commercial construction end market, as well as our residential end market.","In Asia Pacific, organic revenues declined 2%, largely due to a weak housing market. In North America, the news was better. Total North American organic revenues grew 2% in the quarter with both residential organic revenues up 6% and renovation organic revenues up 4%. However, commercial construction organic revenues declined 9%, which was in line with Dodge U.S. commercial construction data for the first quarter.","We were very pleased, however, with the 320 basis points of operating margin improvement in the quarter, lower restructuring costs versus the first quarter of last year, as well as strong overhead management and BSS savings accounted for the significant improvement in operating margins.","In Specialty Products, our newly named replacement for our All Other segment, organic revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. Our worldwide consumer packaging business grew organic revenues 1%, mainly due to strong growth contributions from the Vertique automated case picking system. Our worldwide appliance business produced an organic revenue decline of 3% due to weaker European demand.","Finally, in our Industrial Packaging segment, the falloff in industrial production demand in both North America and Europe serves as a backdrop for our results in this segment. In aggregate, our total North American and international Industrial Packaging organic revenues declined 1% and 7%, respectively. The chief contributor to both organic revenue decrease was worldwide strapping and equipment decrease of 8%. And this decrease was largely driven by steel strapping volume declines, which were more in Europe where strap, steel strap was more prevalent; and a bit less in North America were plastic strap is a bit more popular.","In our other categories, protective packaging grew organic revenues 4%, and stretch packaging's organic revenues fell 8% due to a timing issue related to agricultural customers.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Ron, who will update you on our 2013 forecast. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thanks, John. Before I provide the details on our Q2 and full year 2013 forecast, please note that the 2012 comparisons we will be using to measure our 2013 performance. As I mentioned earlier, we will be presenting our 2012 results on a pro forma basis, which excludes the 2012 operating results of the Decorative Surfaces business, as well as the fourth quarter 2012 gain on divestiture and equity interest.","Our 2012 GAAP and pro forma results have also been restated for discontinued operations. Excluding the Decorative Surfaces items from our 2012 actual results, our Q2 2012 pro forma revenue was $4.2 billion with operating income of $710 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.02. Our pro forma 2012 full year revenue was $16.3 billion with operating income of nearly $2.7 billion. Our 2012 pro forma EPS was $3.70, which will be the 2012 baseline EPS we'll use as a comparison point to our 2013 forecast.","Now, moving on to the 2013 guidance. For the full year 2013, our forecasted EPS range for continuing operations is $4.15 to $4.35. This range assumes a total revenue increase of 2% to 4% versus pro forma 2012. This revenue range is slightly lower than our January forecast, as we now anticipate organic revenue growth of 0% to 2% for the year. Additionally, we expect our full year operating margins to be in a range of 16.9% to 17.3% versus 2012 margins of 16.3%.","The full year EPS midpoint of $4.25 is unchanged from our prior forecast and would be 15% higher than the 2012 pro forma EPS of $3.70. Our current forecast incorporates our performance in the first quarter and benefits from higher forecasted share repurchases, offset by lower expected organic revenue growth, as well as $0.07 of dilution from businesses that have been moved to discontinued operations.","Key drivers of our year-over-year 15% EPS growth include the following: $0.32 from our base businesses, driven from organic growth, as well as the net benefits of our enterprise initiatives, primarily related to business structure simplification, with some sourcing benefits later in the year; the expected benefits from our initiatives to be more than half of our base business income growth. We now expect to see an $0.18 benefit from share repurchases, while shares we bought back in 2012 and our 2013 share repo forecast of, at least, $850 million. We expect our forecasted share buyback to offset the dilution we have from our discontinued operations. And lastly, we have a net $0.06 benefit from other items, including acquisitions, restructuring, nonoperating costs and a 2013 versus 2012 tax rate decline.","For the second quarter of 2013, we are forecasting diluted income per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $1.04 to $1.12, which assumes a total revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. Note that our second quarter forecast includes nearly $30 million of additional restructuring expense versus last year, which reduces our second quarter operating margin by 70 basis points and our second quarter EPS by $0.05 versus 2012.","The midpoint of the Q2 diluted EPS range of $1.08 would be a 5.9% growth versus the 2012 pro forma EPS of $1.02.","I will now turn it back over to John for the Q&A.","John L. Brooklier","Thank you, Ron. We'll now open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Scott, you guys mentioned equipment sales began to pick up in March. You had sort of sequential increases. Could you talk about where that was? And did you see that at all out of Europe, or was Europe still decelerating throughout the quarter?","E. Scott Santi","The primary businesses that we're talking about in the equipment space would be Test & Measurement, welding, Food Equipments. In terms of regional color, I think there's no question that Europe remains much tougher. So in terms of the improvement through the quarter, there's no question that it was certainly more tilted towards North America.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is it too early to ask you about April?","E. Scott Santi","It is a little early. Certainly, based on everything we're hearing, we remain on track relative to our plan.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And if I could, for the follow-up, ask you about North American Construction. You guys did a great job of margins. When I look at the revenue growth, I mean, you mentioned the commercial year-over-year decline, that's fine. When I look at sort of your residential and your renovation, it's still underperforming housing starts by quite a bit. Is this still a share issue that you can improve over time? And maybe you could talk about nonresidential, in general, in the U.S.? It's certainly been more sluggish than we'd like. Can that get better over time?","E. Scott Santi","In terms of the non-res, in terms of the market, or you're talking about our particular performance?","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The market on the non-res, and maybe the share on the res.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think I'll take those in sort of reverse order. I think from a commercial construction standpoint, obviously, there's been -- the environment there, overall, has been pretty sluggish for some time. Our expectations are for some sort of reasonable sequential improvement, perhaps later in the year. But that's going to be very much predicated on how the overall economy progresses from here. And on the resi side, I think we're still in the mode of sort of lagging the start recovery just from the standpoint of when we participate. And also there's some sort of differences on a regional basis with where some of the hotter sectors are relative to our positions. But overall, we expect this business to continue to improve in terms of our overall organic rates given the trends that we're seeing and housing starts continue.","Operator","The next question from Jamie Cook, Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. Not to split hairs, but when you talked about operating leverage on your base business, I think you said more than half would be related to some of the internal initiatives that you have, which sounds a little better. I mean, I think last quarter, you said half. But I'm just wondering if some of the initiatives you have in place are returning results a little bit quicker than you had anticipated. And then I guess my second question is, Scott, I think last quarter, in the Q&A session, you talked a little bit about constraints on craft labor and construction in North America. If you continue to see that or if you've seen the markets get a little tighter relative to where we were a couple of months ago?","E. Scott Santi","So on the operating leverage question, if you remember, we talked about, as you said, half of the benefit in the original plan was related to initiatives. What's happened since is we've brought down our base revenue forecast. So as a result, the income from our base businesses from our normal operations has gone down, but our initiatives are largely on track. So the initiative benefits are now a bigger portion of the overall base income increase.","Ronald D. Kropp","And related to your question on Construction. Our understanding is that labor remains tight in the Construction market, and that it is still having some effect on the pace of the recovery.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, but no material change since last quarter?","Ronald D. Kropp","No.","Operator","The next question from John Inch, Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there any sort of an update to your targeted number of businesses from simplification? I think you had sort of talked to 150 in the past. Just remind us if that's still about the number? I realize it's still early days, but...","Ronald D. Kropp","We originally gave you a number that was closer to 150 when we were in New York. The more current number that we have that we've been sharing with shareholders is really in the 110 to 120 range. I think that they're -- that number is fluid, and you'll probably see that number move. My sense is it's probably going to move down a little bit as opposed to move up.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But not a lot from...","Ronald D. Kropp","Not a lot from where it is.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the implication of this, if you sort of think of taking several hundred businesses and streamlining them down to fewer businesses and leveraging scale economies for purchasing and overhead savings, if you're actually moving to a significantly fewer count, shouldn't that provide for -- I mean obviously maybe not in '13, but significantly improved sourcing and scale leverage on overhead over time?","Ronald D. Kropp","In terms of the difference between 150 and 120?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, and then to John's point, maybe ultimately progressing closer to 100? I mean, it seems like a significant count difference to me.","E. Scott Santi","I think the big move is obviously the 600 plus down to 150 to 120. I think the sort of change between 150 and 120 is not so much a function of sort of scale, but more from the standpoint of the planning and execution within the businesses as we actually start to work this initiative. The 120 is just the place that we're landing, not as a target, but as the place that makes the most sense from the standpoint of the markets that we serve and how we want to structure ourselves to best operate and execute in those markets.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, no, that makes sense. Can I, Scott, then follow-up here with a question on share repurchase? I see that you've upped your target repurchase for the year, so I applaud you for that. This widely propagated negative investment thesis is this whole pending dilution from the sale of Signode. And you guys have a great balance sheet, strong cash flow. I'm just wondering, what are your thoughts toward -- and I realize you're going to deal with Signode later in the year. But what are your thoughts toward, perhaps even more meaningfully, upping share repurchase just to close what seems to be a dilutionary gap and sort of this, at least, hurdle in the minds of investors toward future dilution? What are your thoughts there?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think it's a little early in the process, but I would say that all options are certainly on the table. And it's a process that we will certainly focus on and work our way through as we go through the year and get some better definition around the actual structure of how that's going to all take place. I'm talking about the Industrial Packaging divestiture. But it's an active discussion with our board and with our management team, and it will continue to be so. And we will update our shareholders at the appropriate time.","John L. Brooklier","And the fact, as we looked at it this quarter, that's one of the reasons we bumped up the share repurchase forecast for the year from $500 million to $850 million. And that's really just from operating cash flow. What we also have said is to the extent we get U.S. after-tax divestiture proceeds, that will be on top of the $850 million. So certainly, as we moved 6 business that are held for sale into discontinued operations, as we start selling those or get close to selling those, we'll add to the share repurchase there. And then certainly, as we move with Industrial Packaging over the next year plus, we'll have to make a decision on share repurchase related to that, depending on what the ultimate outcome is.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And with interest rates so low, would you consider or at least not rule out raising some debt to perhaps get a bit of an advanced jump on the sale of Signode through offsetting the dilution?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, all options are on the table.","Operator","The next question from Deane Dray, Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Scott, would like to get some more color on the point in the release and what you talked about this morning on the call here that you've reached the decisions as to where you draw the line between what are core businesses, the keepers, versus those for potential divestiture of the commoditization. Just seems like you reached this conclusion earlier than what we had been thinking. So how did you end up reaching it probably earlier than what people were thinking? And then what was the decision making, and especially, with regard to some of the businesses in Polymers and Fluids and Specialty Products?","E. Scott Santi","Well, we talked about it in -- from the outset, the sort of primary strategic driver was really around the whole issue of sort of level of differentiation that resides in the businesses, to really focus the company on areas that could fully maximize the benefits of the ITW business model. And one of the key elements of that is the ability to operate in spaces where we can innovate. And we talked about from the get-go that, ultimately, as a result of the implementation of this portfolio strategy, that roughly 25% of the company's revenues, as we started the process, were ultimately under some review related to that. So at the front end, we had a pretty good sense of the issues, where some of the issues were around sort of executing this strategy. We took the last -- we've been working on this for a couple of years, and we've spent a lot of time really looking deeply at each of those businesses and understanding what the options were long term. And ultimately, with the things that we've announced and\/or executed on already, we're coming out at about 26% of revenue. So ended up right where we communicated we would be at the beginning. I'm not sure that I can sort of comment on what you were thinking relative to what we were thinking, but this is not early or late. This is pretty much in line with our game plan around executing this.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just to clarify on second quarter guidance, the implied organic revenue growth in the range?","Ronald D. Kropp","It's 1.2%.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","At the midpoint?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes.","John L. Brooklier","Deane, I would add on to that, as you look for the remaining quarters, what's left -- now clearly, we had a negative coming into Q1, one less day and some tough comps. But if you look at the rest of the quarters in aggregate, our Qs 2 through 4 would average slightly over 2%, organically. So clearly, we see better organic growth as we move ahead in the next 3 quarters.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then last one for me, if I look at capital allocation, I think we've gone through the buyback strategy for the balance of the year. But one of the numbers that jumps out at me is M&A, $56 million in the quarter. Are you shying away from assets? I know you said there'd be fewer in terms of what the appetite would be. But are you passing on businesses, or are there just not attractive assets out there?","E. Scott Santi","No, I wouldn't say we're passing. What I would repeat is what I said at the last quarterly call, which is that acquisitions are not a priority for us this year, given the sort of multitude of initiatives that we are executing. That does not mean that we wouldn't look very seriously at something that was a really strong fit and a great opportunity, but ultimately, from a standpoint of how much time we're spending looking at acquisitions, it is a lower priority this year.","Operator","Next question from Ann Duignan, JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the CapEx-related businesses that you said were trending up in March? I mean, you've got -- I think you said Test & Measurement, welding and Food Equipment. Those are very disparate businesses. Could you just dig a little bit deeper and tell us what you're seeing out there in those businesses?","E. Scott Santi","I can't give you any -- a lot more depth other than the fact that it was sort of very clear to us in January and the early part of February that overall capital spending was -- started the year very sluggish and that we saw some pretty nice improvement across all the parts of the business, the capital goods-related product portfolio of the business as we moved into March. So I can't tell you whether it was sort of fiscal cliff concerns, or there's a whole multitude of things. But the overall environment that we saw was a lot of hesitation on capital-related spending early in the year, and that seems to be moderating quite a bit as we got later into the quarter across all 3 businesses.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So nothing in particular. No -- customers stepped out, is that were you're saying? Customers kind of stepped aside in January and February and just are coming back in now?","E. Scott Santi","That's what it felt like.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then given your divestitures and your strategy for divestitures, can you talk a little bit about what the environment is like out there for purchases of some of these businesses? Are you finding a lot of appetite, a lot of interest? Are companies hesitant to step in and make acquisitions? And just a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the environment out there on the...","E. Scott Santi","I think we're seeing a pretty good environment. If you think about where interest rates are, it's certainly a good environment, especially for the sponsor side of the buyer universe. And that's where we've gotten a lot of interest from some of the assets we have currently held for sale.","Operator","The next question from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","While you had really nice growth out of China this past quarter, and you're pretty well diversified across your businesses in China, it'd be helpful to get some more color. Clearly, auto OEM was up significantly, and perhaps, maybe there was some pressure on the electronic side. But any more color you can provide on the trend in China, that would be very helpful.","Ronald D. Kropp","What I'd like to say is we saw a broad-based improvement in China, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. And clearly, most of our growth in China was driven by very, very robust over-performance on the auto OEM side. There were a few businesses that sequentially did a little bit better, but I would say that it's much more tied to what's going on, on the auto side than anything else.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then areas of weakness, specifically, in China? Did you see any end markets that were decelerating?","Ronald D. Kropp","No, I don't think we saw anything decelerating, but I don't think -- we clearly saw big, big improvements out of our auto business. The rest of them were -- did okay, sequentially, a little bit better, but nothing dramatic.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then...","Ronald D. Kropp","I think the arrow is pointing to better performance in China as move through the year. How much better remains to be seen.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as it relates to the divestiture in Industrial Packaging, can you remind us again what the timing, what your expected timing is? And then as it relates also to the proceeds that can be used for buyback. My recollection was that approximately 50% of the business was international, 50% of the business was U.S. And so, approximately 1\/2 of the proceeds could potentially be used for buybacks, is that correct?","E. Scott Santi","So as we announced in February, what we're doing is a strategic review of the Industrial Packaging business. So there's been no formal decision to divest it via sale, spin or whatever. So that's currently what we're working through internally within the company and at the board level. And once we get to a decision on the path, that'll be announced, and we'll work through that across the appropriate timing. I wouldn't expect it to be sold or spun off or anything to happen in 2013. It's probably likely a 2014 event if something does happen. From a proceeds perspective, you're correct, about 1\/2 the business is overseas, although a lot of the intellectual property is owned in the U.S. So part of the process we're going through is evaluating how much of the proceeds would be in the U.S., how much would be available for share repurchase if it was a sale process. So that's one of the things that we're looking at currently. But likely greater than 50% would be in the U.S.","Operator","The next question from Ajay Kejriwal from FBR.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So maybe just a couple clarification questions on the '13 guide. So you're divesting -- discontinuing about $600 million in res, that's a $0.07 impact. Is that in your guide, is that baked into your guidance? And then you had a $0.05 onetime, or my sense is it's not -- it's excluded from the guide, but if you can clarify both, that'd be helpful.","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, so our original forecast in January included these discontinued operations in the numbers because they were -- at that point, they were part of continuing operations. So one of the changes we've made here is we've pulled out these 6 businesses, and they have a $0.07 earnings for the year. So that comes out of the original forecast. So if our midpoint was $4.25, the adjusted forecast really becomes $4.18. And then we're adjusting for -- the first quarter out-performance was $0.06, including the onetime gain; another $0.06 positive from higher share repurchase; a negative $0.04 from lower base business revenues the rest of the year; and then a negative $0.01 for everything else, primarily translation, gets you back to the $4.25. So at the end of the day, what we've done is we've held our guidance at $4.25, even with $0.07 coming out for discontinued operations.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. So the $0.07 included, but the $0.05 also included, the $0.05 gain?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes, yes.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","But then you're not baking in for any additional share buybacks from the proceeds as you sell those businesses, right?","Ronald D. Kropp","Right. Based on the $850 million, which is coming out of free operating cash flow.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And then maybe on the auto aftermarket, I know you mentioned some PLS activity kind of hurting revenues. But if you exclude PLS, what's the trend there? It's kind of a little surprising. I thought it was a steady-Eddie business. Is it related to miles driven, or any trends you're seeing there --","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think it's -- some of it's miles driven, some of it's weather related. I think one of the bigger things we pointed out when we talked about the auto aftermarket was the loss of a key customer in one of the bigger retail outlets. So that certainly carries over quarter-to-quarter as we compare year-over-year. But I would tell you it's sort of the market itself is, in North America, is doing -- it's probably -- certainly it's not robust.  Maybe growing. If it's growing, it's growing at a very, very, very low level. On the European side, that's probably the reverse of that where it's probably negative market activity.","Operator","The next question from Andy Casey, Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on the construction products margin performance. It was good margin improvement in difficult markets for the quarter. But it's still kind of trailing the new adjusted average 18.5% by a little less than 600 [ph] basis points. Can you kind of give us a roadmap over what timeframe you think the gap can be closed? And then is that dependent on the corporate initiatives, or are there segment-specific initiatives that we should contemplate?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, our plan for Construction is that we will get to ITW level margins there within 2 years. And that will be a combination of enterprise initiatives, but probably much more weighted to things going on in the business right now. The overall color is, I think, we've been sort of structuring the business to participate in the recovery and have been kind of hanging in there with a cost structure that was much more relevant to conditions 5 years ago. And as things -- the recovery was delayed, things didn't necessarily play out into the sort of normal recovery scenario. We were just, we just took too long to sort of readjust our thinking and our cost structure. And we've got a really aggressive management team in there now, we're getting after it. This business has, absolutely has the potential to perform at or above our expectations for the overall enterprise. And some nice improvement as a starting point. We've got a long way to go to get there, but we are absolutely committed, and we have no doubt that this -- that the Construction business can perform at a level that's accretive to the overall company.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And if I can sneak in one more, just returning to the Industrial Packaging timing question. Is it still likely, if that business is going to end up being separated, that the business results will be moved to disc ops ahead of the potential transaction? And ballpark, what are you -- is the timing still the end of the year for a decision, or is it somewhere in the second half?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think as I said, we're working through the decision, right? So we can't really disclose what we expect the timing to be at this point, but we would expect it to be a decision, certainly by the end of the year. The discontinued ops reporting, it really depends on the outcome of the strategic review process. If it's a sale process, then there's certain criteria you have to meet, including actively marketing it for sale, before you could put into discontinued ops. But it would be -- it would go into discontinued ops in advance of the actual closing of the sale, unlike Decorative Surfaces. If it's a spinoff, then that doesn't go into discontinued ops until the date of the spin. It depends on the ultimate vehicle for divestment as far as discontinued ops reporting goes.","Operator","Next question from Rob Wertheimer, Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","It looked to me like the increase in the op margin from Jan guide to now is largely the $600 million of divested businesses at a lower margin? Is that correct, or is there something else bridging that op margin improvement?","Ronald D. Kropp","For the full year forecast, the majority, about 30 basis points of the full year margin increase is related to removing the discontinued operations businesses, which have a 6% overall margin, from continuing moving into the discontinued.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then second, in the nonoperating -- the bridge from the last guidance to now, nonoperating was a $0.09 headwind, and now, it's a $0.05 tailwind. You may have just touched on this -- or I'm sorry, a $0.03 tailwind. Could you just go through that again?","Ronald D. Kropp","So in the nonoperating area for the quarter, there was a $0.06 benefit, $0.05 of that was this JV gain, and $0.01 is normal nonoperating kinds of things.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","In guidance, though?","Ronald D. Kropp","And so in the guidance, that includes the 5 -- the majority of the change in the guidance for non-op is the first quarter non-op change.","Operator","The next question, from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Just a quick question on the operating margins as we learn the new segments and new numbers. Is there anything in the first quarter operating results, are any of those margins under more pressure as we go through the rest of the year? I mean we understand welding had a big number last year, but the year, I guess the year was about 25.4%, so we're actually still above that. Is there any of those segments, as you look out through rest of the year, that the first quarter operating margins would have difficulty being sustained for the rest of the year?","Ronald D. Kropp","In fact, it's actually the opposite. The first quarter with -- because it's our lower revenue -- lowest revenue quarter, it's typically the lowest margin quarter.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, I realize that.","Ronald D. Kropp","So across all the segments, we'll see increases in operating margins the rest of the year. Part of that is just normal seasonality and base business improvement, growth versus negative revenue growth. But also a lot of the initiative benefits come in the back half of the year as well.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So there's nothing -- I realize -- I just wanted to make sure there was nothing that we're seeing, particularly with some of the weakness in welding or some of the weakness in Food Equipment business, all of those are expected.","Ronald D. Kropp","No, no.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And as you look out for the rest of the year, particularly industrial businesses, welding and Food Equipment, are you expecting overall demand to improve so the negative revenue comps turn positive?","E. Scott Santi","Yes.","John L. Brooklier","I think the answer is yes. If you go back to what we talked about, Eli, in terms of our quarters and relative to organic revenue, we think Qs 2 through 4 will average slightly over 2%. So I think that underscores both equipment recovery and probably some consumable improvement, too.","Operator","The next question is from Joel Tiss of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Did I hear you right that, apart from the Industrial Packaging business, that you're mostly done with the divestments?","E. Scott Santi","Yes.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And does that mean that as we look into '14 and beyond that we're going to see more of a shift away from share repurchase toward acquisitions again?","E. Scott Santi","Not necessarily. We're going to allocate capital, as Ron described, as part of his comments, which is ultimately, we're going to allocate capital between our 2 external options based on where the best risk-adjusted returns are. We're certainly not going to shy away from good acquisitions that really fit tightly with our core strategy and that fit the -- accelerate growth positions in our portfolio. But we're not also envisioning a day when we're acquiring 50 companies a year and adding 5% to 7% of our sales in acquired revenue every year.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So this new framework will be kind of an ongoing?","E. Scott Santi","Yes.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then can you just give us the, roughly, even a range, number of shares outstanding at the end of the year, or that's too fluid at this point?","Ronald D. Kropp","At the end of this year?","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, at the end of 2013.","Ronald D. Kropp","We can give you the end of the quarter. The end of the quarter is about 450 million. And typically, there's about 4 million to 5 million in dilution on top of that. So you can do the math around the rest of the share repurchase and average price to come up with an end of the year estimate.","Operator","Next question from Jim Krapfel of MorningStar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'd like to hear what your largest 2 or 3 challenges in successfully executing your strategic initiatives are? And what unforeseen obstacles have come about in the early stages of your evolution?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think from our standpoint, the biggest challenges are really managing the pace of execution; that we've got across all of these initiatives, I think things that we are very committed to, very enthusiastic about, but at the same time, this is not a broken company. This is a company that's performed very well. These are initiatives to further improve an already strong company. So from the standpoint of the challenges that I and the rest of the management team, the thing we talk about more than anything is making sure that we've got a good plan, that, that plan is paced appropriately. We've got to deliver the bacon quarter by quarter. I think this is a good example of some pretty terrific execution in the environment, and at the same time, moving the needle and making progress on these initiatives. And we've got to have a good balance on both as we move through the process. So I think that's the challenge that we continue to focus on internally. As it relates to the initiatives and any surprises, I don't think we've had any. If anything, I think as the deeper we get into them, the more convinced we are that we are on the right path and that these initiatives are absolutely going to make a big difference in terms of the overall performance of the enterprise on a long-term basis. So I think that's where I'll leave it.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And second question, how do you see Europe tracking throughout the year? Are you expecting a similar degree of weakness, or do you think an inflection to improvement or worst things more likely?","E. Scott Santi","No improvement is in our planning scenario.","John L. Brooklier","I think we're going to leave it right there at the end of the hour. We've hit the end of the hour. So we thank everybody for participating in today's call. And I'm sure I'll be talking to a number of you later today.","E. Scott Santi","Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","May I introduce your speaker for today, Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Larsen","All right, thank you Dale. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. And joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. I am also joined by Karen Fletcher, our new head of Investor Relations. Many of you may know Karen from her five years as head of investor relations at DuPont, so welcome Karen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and update you on our 2018 earnings forecast.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the first quarter and full year 2018 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide.","We refer you to the company\u2019s 2016 Form 10-K for more detailed about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Santi","Thanks, Michael, and good morning everyone. The fourth quarter closed out another year of record performance and strong execution by the ITW team, excluding one-time tax and legal items 2017 earnings per share of $6.59 was up 16% versus 2016 and we achieved record performance and all of our key operating metrics.","Operating income of $3.4 billion was up 11%, operating margin of 23.7% was up 120 basis points and after-tax return on invested capital of 24.4% was up 230 basis points. In addition, we returned more than $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","We also continued to make meaningful progress on our focused efforts to accelerate organic growth. Our 2017 organic growth rate of 3% was up almost 2 full percentage points versus 2016, and in additional our Q4 organic growth rate of 4% gives us good momentum heading into 2018.","Overall these results demonstrate that we are continuing to make progress in our efforts to position ITW to generate consistent differentiated performance on a sustained basis. Through the combination of ITW\u2019s high-quality business portfolio and our continued focus on leveraging ITW\u2019s powerful business model to full potential, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond.","In closing, let me say we owe a huge debt of gratitude to our ITW colleagues around the world for their commitment to executing our strategy and serving our customers with excellence each and every day. They are responsible for ITW\u2019s strong performance and give us great confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustained top-tier performance as we go forward.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Michael who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q4 and full year 2017 performance, and on our updated 2018 forecast. Back to you, Michael.","Michael Larsen","All right, thank you Scott. So starting on slide three, before I get to the details regarding our 2017 performance and 2018 forecast, I wanted to spend a few minutes clarifying the impact of the new tax legislation on our reported Q4 and full year 2017 results.","This schedule walks us through the impact of the one-time Q4 tax charge associated with the tax cuts and jobs act and then I\u2019ll talk about the tax rate and capital flexibility benefits that would accrue to 2018 and beyond.","As you can see, we recorded a one-time tax charge of $658 million or the equivalent of $1.92 of EPS in the fourth quarter, reducing EPS from $1.70 to a GAAP EPS loss of $0.22. I should point out that this charge is our best estimate based on all the information available to us today.","The charge has two primary elements, one a $729 million charge for the estimated repatriation taxes, and two, a net benefit of $71 million resulting from the revaluation or ITW\u2019s deferred taxes.","We are in the process of analyzing the implications of the new tax law from a capital structure and capital allocation standpoint. Given both the magnitude of the changes involved, and that we expect further clarification with regard to the application of certain provisions of the legislation, we are not far enough along in our analysis to make any strategic decisions with regard to how we will deploy our existing overseas cash or to make a determination as to whether it will cause us to alter our capital structure or capital allocation framework.","That said, we have begun implementing plans to repatriate approximately $2 billion of surplus capital to the U.S. by year-end 2018 and we have decided to accelerate our previously announced plan to increase ITW\u2019s dividend payout ratio.","Subject to formal board approval, we now expect to increase our dividend payout ratio from 43% to approximately 50% of free cash flow on a run rate basis in August of this year versus by 2020 as previously communicated.","With regard to the impact of the new tax legislation on our tax rate, we estimate that our tax rate for 2018 will be in the range of 25% to 26%. As you may recall, we use the tax rate of 29% when we should issued guidance in December.","Our updated guidance today incorporates the benefit of the lower rate, which has a favorable EPS impact of $0.35 or 5%. We will provide additional detail and analysis of the one-time charge in our 10K.","Moving onto slide four, we have also included a schedule for the full year 2017 that separates out the one-time impact of the tax legislation that I just talked about, and a previously disclosed legal item from the underlying operating performance of ITW.","You can see our full year results with 5% revenue growth and 11% operating income growth, 120 basis points of margin expansion and 16% EPS growth. I\u2019ll cover those results in more detail in a few slides. ","So with the impact of these non-recurring items clearly identified upfront, when I discuss our financial results for Q4, and full year 2017 on the following slides, the results presented and my commentary will exclude the impact of these two one-time items and focus on the operating performance of the company.","We\u2019ll exclude the impact of these two one-time items and focus on the operating performance of the company. So on slide five, our Q4 performance ex the tax charge we grew EPS by 17% year-over-year to $1.70 exceeding the $1.60 midpoint of our prior guidance with $0.04 contribution from operations and $0.06 from a lower tax rate.","You may recall that in Q4 last year, we recorded a net EPS benefit of $0.06 from a dividend payment offset by several small divestitures. If you adjust for these items, our Q4 EPS on an apples-to-apples basis was 22%.","Total revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% with organic growth of 4% led by Test and Measurement\/Electronics up 9%, welding up 6% and specialty product up 5%. All major geographies are positive, 4% growth in North America, 3% growth in Europe, 5% growth in Asia-Pacific including 7% in China.","We improved operating margin by 160 basis points to 23.4% with Enterprise initiatives contributing 140 basis points. Free cash flow of $617 million was 106% of adjusted net income.","So overall, another strong high-quality quarter to wrap up 2017 as the ITW team continues to execute.","On slide six, you can see the drivers of our operating margin performance this quarter, which was once again driven by strong executional enterprise initiatives. They continue to be the main driver of our operating margin expansion and contributed 140 basis points in the quarter, which is the highest level since we launched our enterprise strategy five years ago.","Good momentum and a solid backlog of opportunities in both our strategic sourcing and 8020 [ph] reapplication initiatives have us well set up for another 100 basis points of margin expansion in 2018 independent of volume.","Volume leverage was 90 basis points and as expected price cost was slightly unfavorable this quarter at 50 basis points. As you may recall in our guidance for 2018, we are assuming 30 to 40 basis points of headwind from price cost.","Overall, operating margin of 23.4% was an increase of 160 basis points and a new Q4 record for the company. On slide seven, you can see the meaningful progress on our focused efforts to accelerate organic growth across the segments.","Our Q4, 2017 organic growth rate of 4% was up 2 percentage points year-over-year. And when you look at the detail by segment, you can see the strength of ITW\u2019s diversified high-quality business portfolio. Some of our faster growers last year like automotive OEM and food equipment may have slowed in the near-term due to market conditions, but others like Test and Measurement, Electronics and Welding have accelerated and net were growing at 2X last year\u2019s rate.","In addition when you look at the operating margins, you notice two things, one, everyone improved year-over-year, and two, there are no weak links across our diversified portfolio. Let\u2019s go a little deeper by segment starting with automotive OEM, where we had another strong quarter with overall organic growth of 3% in a flat market with above market growth in all geographies, as we continue to increase our content per vehicle.","In North America, organic growth was down 2% better than auto bills, which were down 4% overall and down 7% with the Detroit 3. Growth on the international side was very strong with Europe up 7%, and China was up 14%.","As you know the growth on a quarterly basis can bounce around a bit, so we added the full year organic growth and build\u2019s numbers to the page. In North America, we managed to hold revenue to down 1% for the year, while overall builds were down four. In Europe and China our growth of 8% and 17% significantly outpaced bills of 3% and 2% respectively.","Operating margin improved despite the previously discussed price cost headwinds. In terms of 2018, the most recent HIS forecast has auto build up 1% to 2% and we have essentially locked in content growth for 2018 against the automotive OEM segment organic growth of 4% to 5% for the year at these build levels.","Food equipment organic revenue this quarter was flat overall, with North America down 1% in a soft market and against the comparison of up 4% last year as institutional sales was down 8% against the tough 2016 comparison of plus 23%.","Retail was also down 5%. International was flat with equipment down 1% and service up 3% and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 25.8%. Very strong quarter for Test and Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue grew 9% as Test & Measurement grew by 13%.","In Instron, where demand is tied closely to the business investment cycle, organic growth was up 8% and electronics was up 4%.","Progress on operating margin performance was also very strong at 23.4% an improvement of 330 basis points driven by enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. As a reminder, the 23.4% includes 280 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition related intangible assets.","Also on slide nine, strong momentum in welding continues with organic growth of 6% in Q4. By geography, North America was up 10%, our industrial equipment business which serves primary into manufacturing including automotive and heavy equipment was up 15% in the quarter, while our commercial equipment business which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication and farm and ranch customers, was up a solid 5% year-on-year.","Overall, equipment was up 13% while consumables were down 2%. International was down 10% due primary to oil and gas and please keep in mind that international only represents approximately 20% of our welding segment. On the margin front, operating margin improved this quarter by 200 basis points to 26.4%.","Polymers & Fluids with positive organic revenue growth of 3% as fluids grew by 5% and automotive aftermarket and polymers both grew 2%. As a reminder here, the 19.9% operating margin includes 400 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition related intangible assets.","Construction products grew 4% organically. North America was up 2 with residential remodel of 2% and commercial down 1%. International was strong with Europe up 5% and Asia-Pacific was up 4%.","Operating margin performance was solid at 23.4% which represents 200 basis point improvement year-over-years primarily due to enterprise initiatives. Finally, in specialty product organic revenue was up 5% with notable strength on the equipment side and by geography North America was up 4% and international was up 6%.","As Scott mentioned as you can see on slide 11, 2017 was a record year for ITW. We achieved 16% EPS growth, increase revenue of 5% to $14.3 billion and continued to make meaningful progress with 3% organic growth, and positive organic growth in all seven segments and all major geographies.","The key performance metrics are all new all-time records including 23.7% operating margin and after-tax ROIC of 24.4%. Free cash flow was $2.2 billion, an increase of 9%. In terms of capital allocation in 2017, we invested almost $600 million in our businesses for growth, and productivity increased ITW\u2019s dividend 20% and returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","Turning to slide 12, you can see our record operating margin performance with 120 basis points of improvement year-on-year and record operating margin of 23.7% excluding the legal item.","We listed the key drivers here including enterprise initiatives of 120 basis points, volume 70 basis points, price cost down 40 basis points, as expected but positive on a dollar basis. EF&C was slightly dilutive and the legal item added 70 basis points for a total reported margin expansion of 190 basis points.","Turning to slide 13, as many of you know we\u2019ve done a lot of work over the past five years to position ITW to consistently deliver solid high-quality growth. We have made some good progress in this regard, as 2017 marked their third year in a row of a meaningful improvement in our organic growth rate.","As you can see slightly negative organic growth in 2015 with a lot of PLS activity turning positive 1% in 2016, 3% in 2017 and based on this positive momentum, in our current run rates, we expect to make meaningful progress again in 2018 with a growth rate in the 3% to 4% range.","Let\u2019s turn to our updated guidance on slide 14. Relative to your December meeting, we raised our full year GAAP EPS guidance at the midpoint by $0.40 or 6% to new range of 745 to 765 which represents 15% year-on-year earnings growth at the 755 midpoint.","The $0.40 increase is essentially $0.35 benefit from our estimated lower tax rate of 25% to 26% and $0.05 from current foreign exchange rates. For 2018, we expect organic growth of 3% to 4% based on current run rates and operating margin of 25% to 25.5% with another 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from our enterprise initiatives.","Free cash flow conversion is expected to exceed 100% of net income and we\u2019ve allocated $1 billion of surplus capital to share repurchases. As we mentioned earlier, we are planning to increase the dividend payout ratio to a run rate of 50% of free cash flow subject to formal board approval in August.","For the first quarter our GAAP EPS guidance is a $1.80 to $1.90 which represents 20% earnings growth year-over-year at the midpoint with organic growth of 3% to 4% in line with current levels of demand.","As per usual our guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates and we are estimating a 24.5% to 25.5% tax rate for Q1. So with that, we\u2019ll now open the call to your questions. And Dale, if you could please open the line for the Q&A session of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Speakers, we do have our first question in queue. This one comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew, your line is now open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So Scott or Mike, you didn\u2019t change your organic growth guidance for 2018, 3% to 4% and we know it\u2019s early in the year. We know your forecast current run rates but you did beat your own organic growth forecast in 4Q was 3.7% and it does seem like many of your businesses are accelerating, you know welding, test and measurement. So why wouldn\u2019t you deliver at least towards the higher end of your organic growth, if current economic conditions hold.","Scott Santi","Sorry about that, by the way the phone ringing in at the background. So essentially I think you\u2019ve pegged it pretty well and the guidance we gave in December was based on activity we were already seeing in the fourth quarter. As you run rate it out, we are still; we think 3 to 4 is the right number. Certainly would acknowledge the fact that there is some momentum building. It is only January, so to the extent things continued on the path of run from the standpoint of the macro environment, I think the possibility is good that we would certainly be in the high end of that range, but from where we sit today, while things are incrementally better, you know the forecast that we gave you in December was based on what we already knew was had going on in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. And then I have to ask you guys about price versus cost obviously in the sense that you know margin improvement of 4Q was still very strong but maybe slightly light of your forecast given the 50 basis points of price versus cost. You mentioned that you still expect 30 to 40 for 2018, what are the chances that the headwinds from price versus cost gets a little worse before it gets better and you know again you mentioned you are still covering it dollar wise. So, you know how concerned are you about sort of the range to get that on margins given relatively high raw material cost?","Michael Larsen","So Andy, I mean we are closely watching this and there certainly is some inflation that is being addressed in our business units. But, I think we have it well covered in our current guidance. So, as you point out, our strategy in 2017 and it will be the same in 2018 is to offset any material cost inflation dollar for dollar with price, and we have been able to do that successfully at the enterprise level. We have assumed for 2018 that we will see a similar impact from a margin standpoint of 30 to 40 basis points. As we talked about in December in New York to be hopefully somewhat conservative we have baked in some EPS headwind as well on the price cost side. So sudden not complacent and taking action getting price in all of our businesses with automotive being the one that\u2019s a little more challenging just given how that industry is structured, but overall feel good about price cost going into 2018.","Scott Santi","What I would just \u2013 would just add to that real quick. I think the reality is as you know this affects percentages, but our \u2013 I think we are very comfortable with our ability to recover dollar for dollar. So from the standpoint of actual EPS risk in 2018 we are very comfortable this is not going to be a significant factor as we sit here today.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciate it guys, nice quarter.","Scott Santi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. John, your line is now open.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Scott Santi","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Morning guys. So cash flow in 2017 on the conversion side, a little wider, your guide has it above 100%. What were the dynamics and then does that have anything to do, Mike or Scott with kind of $600 million of investment spending and I forget what you said the investment spending is going to be for 2018, but maybe you could add a little more color there?","Scott Santi","Yes, that\u2019s actually not the main driver, John. I mean, our investment was up slightly and that\u2019s really if you look at our CapEx and our R&D spend, it\u2019s typically in that 2% of sales range for CapEx and 1.6%, 1.7% for R&D. And so our sales grow, those investments will grow. Operationally we delivered 100%. There are two things going on in the full year number. One is the decision that we made last year to fully fund our pension plans. We talked about that contribution, I think it was in the second quarter last year, on top of our regular contribution the total was about 150 million. And our pension plans are now fully funded to the point where we stress tested them in another '08 '09 type scenario. We are not going to be in a position where we are underfunded on the pension side.","And the other piece that gets you to the 100% free cash flow is just the timing of some cash tax payment in 2017 versus 2016. So operationally we did 100%. Now, if you\u2019re really picky, if you look at Q4, we did see a slight increase in working capital and that\u2019s just to assume, support the higher demand and the increase in backlog that we are seeing in some of our businesses.","John Inch","Which frankly you would have expected, so I think that makes sense. If there is any of the businesses that potentially seem like they maybe could do a bit better, its food equipment and there\u2019s really no evidence of that in the fourth quarter print and your guide kind of around 1% doesn\u2019t anticipate much. Maybe you could just explain to us what could be the variables that could actually drive that business higher? It would obviously be the U.S. economies, it seems to be accelerating. And is Food Equipment, does it typically historically roll higher or could it all of a sudden start to surprise higher. I mean what are the dynamics in that segment that we should be watching for in 2018?","Scott Santi","I think our current view and it is that in the first half of the year we don\u2019t expect much improvement in market conditions in North America. There is some optimism as it relates to the second half. We are modelling at current run rates. We should end up at 2% to 3% for the year, but it continues to be a fairly challenging environment as we\u2019ve talked about for several quarters now in North America.","John Inch","That\u2019s fine. And just last, Michael on tax, one is the 2018 effective rate, the 25, 26 is that kind of a number that sustains, barring any other changes that are unforeseen, meaning you know if you fast forward a few years it should still be 25 to 26 unless something has changed. And then just on that point, I think at the December 1st meeting, you had again informally was it guidance, you said maybe the rate rise in the lower 20s. And I think if there is anything that seems to be a pattern, it\u2019s that you know effective tax rate from the part of the company they are coming in higher than people had otherwise perhaps anticipated, uniformly so I\u2019m just curious if you comment on sort of both fronts. Is the rate higher and why is it higher and then is it sustainable or does it tick higher or lower do you think overtime?","Michael Larsen","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, John. So, to answer your first question, we do expect that this is a year one [ph] run rate of 25 to 26, and as we get ourselves organized here we could potentially see that go lower from here. The rate is slightly higher, not just for us but I think you\u2019ve seen that for others as well then maybe we had expected one, you know the rate, the federal rate went to 21 not to 20. And the other piece is that there are some we believe somewhat unintended consequences in this act associated with a foreign tax, U.S. tax on foreign earnings of the so-called guilty tax ","And the way the math works on that, that\u2019s about two points a headwind to the overall rate. Now that could get, that could get further clarified and maybe there is a workaround, but as the math works today, we are sitting at 25 to 26, and maybe a little bit better on a go-forward basis.","John Inch","Meaning if you hadn\u2019t had U.S. tax reform, you were working various angles legitimately to bring your tax rate down. Does U.S. tax reform kind of bump it lower and then you are still on that trajectory or does it actually with guilty etcetera does it kind of plug that? I guess that\u2019s kind of also what I was trying to\u2026","Michael Larsen","No, I think the current rate reflects our current planning, but obviously as these new rules and they are new, we are talking 30 days here, as we analyze and interpret those and those tied back to the comments we made around our capital structure, I mean there\u2019s some far-reaching implications here as we work through that and get our planning organized. I think that that\u2019s what we believe will give us room to lower the rate on a go-forward basis.","John Inch","Got it. Thank you very much.","Michael Larsen","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning guys, and welcome Karen. So my first question, I guess Michael maybe talking about capital deployment for a second, so clearly nice to see the dividend payout ratio go up and you know the share repurchases, you can easily find out of your free cash flow. So given that you guys are repatriating $2 billion, I\u2019d be curious to hear if you have any initial thoughts on how you are going to allocate that capital?","Michael Larsen","I think Joe, I\u2019ll go back to what I said earlier, is that we are still analyzing all the implications of the new tax law from a capital structure and capital allocation standpoint. As you know, these are pretty significant changes. Some of the rules are not entirely clear yet in terms of their application and we expect to receive a further guidance and we simply haven\u2019t had enough time to really work through this in a deliberate and thoughtful way as the management team and with our board. So we are not at a point today where we can really make any strategic decisions on how we\u2019ll deploy that overseas cash this year and also in the future years as it now is available to us here. And what that exactly it means from a either from a capital structure or a capital allocation framework.","So what we can\u2019t tell you is that we are working to get the 2 billion back by year-end. We don\u2019t have the money as we sit here today and we have made the decision to accelerate the dividend payout ratio as we talked about it earlier. And that\u2019s really as far as we can go, as we sit here today and we\u2019ll keep you posted as we work through this. And so if we have more information here, when we report Q1, we\u2019ll give you an update.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, that\u2019s helpful Michael. And maybe my follow on question and just kind of thinking about the end market trends, clearly you guys ended 2017 with a lot of momentum, particularly within your industrial businesses. So I\u2019d be curious to hear your thoughts around you know given this effect of the tax change, some thoughts around you know CapEx potentially reaccelerating here in the U.S. How are you thinking about the industrial businesses particularly and what the growth trajectory for those businesses should look like?","And I know you\u2019ve given guidance on a segment basis, but I\u2019m wondering if you are expecting to see an uptake from further CapEx investing across the U.S.?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think we are certainly hopeful and the early indications are that we were seeing some acceleration in business investment already, I mean prior to passage, our Q4 rates, you know one of the big deltas was clearly some really meaningful acceleration and demand trends and involving test and measurement and the capital goods components of our specialty segment. And certainly Joe to your point, I think this new tax legislation has great potential to add some further momentum and stimulation to the economy overall and in particular to business investment. So, I think the raw material in terms of some sustained recovery if you will in business investment particularly the U.S. is certainly there, but as is our habit we\u2019ll wait to see it before we plan on it.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. And then if I could maybe just add one more Scott, I noticed that your welding business on the international side was down, you know double-digits, can you maybe just a little bit more color on what\u2019s happening within that market?","Scott Santi","Yes. I suppose that's -- they are mostly it's a relatively small part of the overall business as Michael said and our position there is heavily weighted towards oil and gas. So it\u2019s nothing more than that. Certainly it should to the extent it is a turning in \u2013 any direction I\u2019d say we are certainly bottoming out there. But I don\u2019t think we are particularly good proxy for the overall welding market internationally, given the narrowness of our position there.","Joe Ritchie","Got it, okay thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. David, your line is now open.","David Raso","Good morning. I was curious the organic sales guide for the year, what\u2019s the cadence? The 1Q is three to four \u2013 years three to four, what will be the cadence?","Michael Larsen","It\u2019s actually if you look at it at current run rates, the 3 to 4 and I\u2019m not giving guidance for Q2 or Q3 but it\u2019s in that range, and then probably a little bit lower than that in the fourth quarter just on from a comp standpoint.","David Raso","So even as the comps get a little easier 2Q and 3Q, just thinks if it is sort of 3 to 4?","Michael Larsen","Yes, maybe at the higher end of the range, but in that 3 to 4 ranges based on run rates as we sit here today.","David Raso","And the inventory being flat sequentially it\u2019s usually down 6% or so 3Q to 4Q. Where was the inventory in particular held a little higher anticipating superior growth historically?","Michael Larsen","It was pretty broad based, so I think as you would expect the ones with the highest acceleration in Q4 that we just talked about had a little bit more, but overall there is some pretty good momentum across the portfolio here.","Scott Santi","And these are \u2013 just to add onto that, the way that gets managed internally whether it\u2019s one year is that\u2019s sort of an automatic reaction, that\u2019s not a full forecast. So just as Michael said it happens because demand dictates, not because we're making our own bet on where things are heading.","David Raso","Yes, nothing really but nothing really anticipatory about it. It's simply the way it works","Scott Santi","No, no this \u2013 we don\u2019t as you know most of our businesses are we get the order \u2013 today, we shift tomorrow, we\u2019ve replenished inventory the following day and as demand picks up, we build more inventory. And so that\u2019s really what you are seeing. So I think it\u2019s nothing to be alarmed about.","David Raso","All right, appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Ann, your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Yes, good morning.","Scott Santi","Hi, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Hi, I\u2019d like to ask a tax question in kind of a different way. I mean there are lot of changes as you noted that accelerated depreciation on new unused equipment, the elimination of section 1031. You know as you sit there running out a broad base of businesses, do you expect any changes in purchasing behaviour by any of your customers, I mean I\u2019m thinking through the equipment, automotive, welding you know of any changes that you are contemplating in the way people buy your products because of tax changes.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think I\u2019d tie back to what Scott said earlier. It\u2019s really you know on the business investment side were these new accelerated as depreciation rose, I have probably created some positive stimulus and so that it would be primarily test and measurement, welding as well as portions of specialty. So, I think it\u2019s hard to tie back to you know what specific was tax related but I think its part of an overall improving momentum in those businesses.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate the color. And then on the flip side, a lot of talk about NAFTA and it does seem to be all about automotive and content on where it\u2019s built. If NAFTA were to be eliminated even for a short term and can you talk about what impact it might have or could have on your automotive business?","Michael Larsen","You know and overall what I can tell you is we produce close to where our customers produced in that space. So to the extent this impacts where they choose to produce vehicles and which we have content then we are overtime we would certainly follow those moves. We are well positioned; in fact one of the strengths of our position is our belief to provide copies of that product all over the world, so it's certainly something that is well within our capacity to react to. I can\u2019t really speak as much in terms of overall demand impact for customers in the short run, but I think in terms of does it create any long-term structural issues for us, I can\u2019t really think of any sitting here today.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I\u2019ll leave there. And I appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Andy, your line is now open.","Andy Casey ","Thanks a lot. Good morning everybody. I was wondering if we could go back to test measurement and electronics. Could you give a little bit more color on what happened in the fourth quarter that organic growth rate moved up pretty substantially and part of it seems to be comps, but is there anything else going on there?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think it was pretty broad based really on the test and measurement side and part of what we\u2019re seeing is some strength in the businesses that are tied to the semiconductor end market. But also like I said -- we pointed out, Instron up 8, which we believe again is driven by CapEx, increased demand for CapEx. So those are the two dynamics in test and measurement.","We say it looks pretty for the year. In December, we said 4% to 5%, so it\u2019s kind of mid single-digit type growth for test and measurement and electronics, and as we said here today and that supported by the current run rates and the backlog in that business.","Andy Casey ","Okay. Thanks Michael. And then, if I look at the components of the 2018 guide and then look at the bottom line just trying to reconcile are you expecting any significant change in below the line items, interest expense or other income?","Michael Larsen","So, I think kind of from a modeling standpoint on the interest expense, it will probably be a little bit higher, not because of an assumption around increased debt, but its really some of the euro denominated debt at current currency rate, so I think that\u2019s a $10 million, $15 million increase, if I remember correctly on the interest expense side. Most everything, depreciation might be up a little bit as a result of the increased investment that we talk about to support the growth this year.","The intangibles, we typically go down $10 million to $15 million, so probably a similar trajectory for 2018. And then the other thing that\u2019s little unusual is the unallocated line this year of the legal item is actually showing a positive number. If you take the Q4 number which is the $20 million or so and run rate that out, so about $18 million for the year. I think that gives you kind of the key pieces that you need to put this together for 2018.","Andy Casey ","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie your line is now open.","Scott Santi","Hello, Jamie.","Operator","Since Jamie is not responding shall we go to the next question.","Scott Santi","We can go back to the Jamie, if she \u2013 he is still there.","Operator","Next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO.","Joel Tiss","How you are doing guys?","Scott Santi","Hi, Joel.","Joel Tiss","I just wondered if you repatriate some capital and it comes back kind of chunkier, do you think the share repurchases would flow with that? Or they\u2019re going to be more systematic as we go through the year?","Michael Larsen","What I can\u2019t tell you Joel is we have a $1 billion in the plan which is consistent with what we said in December. And from a planning standpoint that\u2019s $250 million a quarter. And as I said early we can really comment on the plans for the additional surplus capital, the $2 billion or so in terms of the timing. It will comeback by year-end, but we\u2019re still working through the exact timing. And then what that means from a capital allocation or capital structure standpoint, it's a little too early to comment on that.","Joel Tiss","And then the same sort of question on acquisitions with this kind of accelerate your thinking on making bigger acquisitions or the same thing that's more of an opportunistic exercise and the capital flows wouldn't have any impact?","Michael Larsen","Yes. This doesn\u2019t have any impact on our thinking around acquisitions.","Joel Tiss","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Mig Dobre of Baird. Mig, your line is now open.","Mig Dobre","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I want to ask that acquisition question maybe a little differently. Based on what you know thus far from tax reform, are you changing your thinking on M&A at all, meaning, the way you're thinking about tax shields, the way you\u2019re think about the cost of capital, whether or not U.S. acquisitions versus international ones are more or less attractive, really anything different in the wake of this legislation?","Scott Santi","The simple answer is at this point, no.","Mig Dobre","Okay. Then maybe I'll ask a pricing question. You talked about automotive maybe struggling a little bit, but I\u2019m wondering do you have any segments in which pricing is perhaps stronger than you anticipated when you should original guidance at the Analyst Day?","Scott Santi","I think the general framework is really goes back to how we structure the portfolio from a price cost standpoint. So we are operating in spaces and our products are not commodities, their performance matters to the customer, so we expect given that that any changes in input costs over some reasonable period of time that will -- that those changes in input cost will get reflected in the prices we charge our customers, that just been fair, but we are certainly much more oriented towards how do we grow the high-quality portfolio.","And so from the standpoint of overall how to manage this we\u2019re just trying to cover the cost and really remain focused on leveraging the portfolio to continue to accelerate organic growth.","Mig Dobre","I appreciate that. I guess I was just wondering on some your businesses that are clearly showing real volume inflection if it's fair to think that those are the ones that are -- getting [Indiscernible] to this point?","Scott Santi","I\u2019m sorry; you broke up on the last part Mig.","Mig Dobre","What I\u2019m trying to get at is, some of your businesses were clearly seeing a volume inflection. I'm wondering if it's fair to assume that these are also the ones that are currently getting the best price out there.","Scott Santi","I don\u2019t know how to.","Michael Larsen","I think, Mig, for us its really \u2013 for us price cost is a function of just wanting to recover the inflation that we\u2019re seeing over time. And there is typically a little bit about lag as you saw last year, but we\u2019re not trying to get greedy here and charge more in their business than we normally would, so it doesn\u2019t really impact our thinking.","Mig Dobre","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question in queue is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven, your line is now open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Steven Fisher","Good morning. Just coming back to tax reform and CapEx, I know you said you're still determining your overall capital allocation plans after that include CapEx, and you say that CapEx is a function of sales, but I guess to what extend do you have more motivation to increase your own CapEx as a result of tax changes? And if you did what will be the types of things that you invest in? Would it be automation, more capacity in general, relocating capacities, any thought there?","Scott Santi","I think, Steve, the answer is, if you look at our strong cash flow that we\u2019re already generating and have been for many years. We are already full invested in businesses and in our strategy before the passage of this tax legislation. So there's nothing that we would do or could do now that we didn't do before that would be accretive or at the performance or ability to execute a strategy, so at this point we\u2019re modeling and we penciled in two percent of sales on CapEx. We talked a lot about that in December how we think about these internal investments. And this any changes on the tax side have not \u2013 don\u2019t have any impact there.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And I know you're looking for flat commercial construction in 2018 back at the Investor Day. What have you seen over the last month and a half that may shift that in one direction or another if anything?","Scott Santi","I think at this point broadly for construction products we\u2019re still in that 3% to 4% organic growth range for the year and commercial we don't \u2013 there\u2019s really no change in terms of our view on the commercial side.","Steven Fisher","Okay. So it\u2019s still flat.","Scott Santi","Yes, flattish. Yes.","Steven Fisher","Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","Scott Santi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question in queue is from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Nathan, your line is now open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Nathan Jones","Michael, the $729 million repatriation charges that your expectation of what the cash charge will be over eight year, so like 90 million a year? And does that include free cash flow?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So, if you look at the overall charge, the $658 million is very close to a cash number fin two free cash flow yet the liability will charge 608 million is very close to a cast number for all intents and purposes. So if you look at our balance sheet, you\u2019ll see a payable there, non-current tax payable that 614 and then there\u2019s another 50 million or so in current payables, all related to tax reform.","I should point of clarification that the repatriation tax number, the 729 also includes any foreign withholding tax on those cash distribution. So any taxes that are payable overseas related to the 2 billion are already accounted for in that number.","Nathan Jones","Okay. So the 660 odd [ph] is roughly that payment over eight years that you'll get?","Michael Larsen","Yes.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Got it. And then just a question I guess it's around T&M and around the CapEx cycle here, I mean, we've seen pretty good recovery in short cycle general industrial, but I guess one thing that's been missing in his recovery is being really any CapEx cycle. You\u2019ve got a few businesses here related CapEx, I think Intron is one that\u2019s particularly levered to that, that is showing good growth that seems to have inflected higher in the fourth quarter. Is it something that you're expecting to continue? Are you seeing signs ex the impact of the tax bill here? Did kind of CapEx cycle was budding here anyway?","Michael Larsen","I think we\u2019ve seen a pickup in those businesses that goes back to before the passage of the tax act. So these businesses and so test and measurement, welding in particular have been pretty sluggish for a number for years. And I think it the recovery that we saw in those businesses goes back to November \u2013 October, November of 2016 and so if anything maybe there some additional stimulus here in those businesses and that would certainly be beneficial to ITW if that\u2019s the case.","Nathan Jones","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.","Scott Santi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next in line is Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Walter, your line is now open.","Walter Liptak","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about 2017 organic growth of 2.9% and have you guys been able to parse out how much his internal initiative versus market growth?","Michael Larsen","I\u2019ll tell you we do collect some data on that. I\u2019m not comfortable really sharing that externally. I think it's a combination of the two as we said in the past. I mean, I think clearly what we had point to Walters just look at the progression of overall organic growth rate with more than one percentage point improvement of 15 over 2015, 2016, 2017 and another meaningful improvement in the growth rate for 2018, and its really a combination of things.","And I think only recently last year we\u2019ve seen a little bit pickup from a market standpoint, but if you look the last three years we've delivered meaningful improvement really in a pretty sluggish overall pretty challenging macro. So that\u2019s the best thing, so I can give that Walter. It\u2019s a little bit of both.","Walter Liptak","Okay. It looks good. Is the PLS in 2017, have you been able to quantify how much of that one was there?","Michael Larsen","It was for year 50 basis points for the year and 70 basis points in Q4.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Is there any PLS headwind in 2018?","Michael Larsen","It will be probably about the same in 2018, so we\u2019re expecting another 50 basis points here maybe as a result of the reapplication of the -- our 8020 [ph] reapplication initiatives across the businesses and you see the benefits were accruing not just in terms of \u2013 from a margin standpoint but also creating a portfolio that has significantly higher organic growth potential.","Walter Liptak","Okay. And then in 2018 the 3% to 4%, I guess it\u2019s probably the same as in 2017 where there is some internal, but it\u2019s hard to pass it out as a ring.","Scott Santi","Yes, it will be a combination again in it. Obviously the further along we are in the process, it would be reasonable to expect a higher contribution from the organic growth initiatives that we are executing across our businesses.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Great, okay thank you.","Scott Santi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross, your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks, good morning gentlemen.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Ross Gilardi","I\u2019m just wondering if you talk a little bit more about that strength in the industrial welding part of your business in North America. And are you seeing your customers continuing to ramp production, is the only reason to expect that that won\u2019t accelerate further in 2018 as the year unfolds.","Scott Santi","I think industrial 15 is that\u2019s a pretty solid number, I don\u2019t know if I would count on further acceleration from there on a sequential basis. The comps year-over-year are going to change as we go through the year, but we feel really good about the improved demand on them, on the, on the industrial side.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, thanks. And then just any color on China, you know as this pertains to auto. I realized China auto in the grand scheme of your portfolio is small, but this is an important part of auto and your ability to continue to generate a 1000 plus basis points of our growth in China auto and anything you can say about like what types of products that\u2019s coming from.","Michael Larsen","So I think it\u2019s actually not that small anymore. I mean, that team has been putting up some really strong growth rates for long period of time and as I said for the full year the China automotive business is up 17% and up 14% here in Q4. And when we look at the backlog in terms of further content per vehicle growth that is a sustainable above market growth rate.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you very much.","Michael Larsen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We show no further questions in queue, but as a reminder for the participants again [Operator Instructions]. One moment, we\u2019ll wait and check for questions.","Scott Santi","If not Dale, why don\u2019t we just wrap it up here and I\u2019d like to thank everybody for dialing in today and Karen and I are around if you want to give us a call.

My name is Sheryl, and I will be your conference operator today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note, today's conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Karen Fletcher","Thank you, Sheryl. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's fourth quarter 2018 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results and we will update you on our 2019 outlook.","Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the first quarter and full-year 2019, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the Company's 2017 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","As a reminder, in 2017, we disclosed $95 million favorable legal settlement and recorded one-time tax charge in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we provided you with two tables on Slides 3 and 4 that summarize key financial measures for fourth quarter and full-year on a GAAP basis, as well as on an adjusted basis excluding the legal settlement and tax charge. For the rest of this conference call, our comments and variances exclude these two one-time times from 2017.","So with that, we can move to Slide 5, and I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.","Scott Santi","Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Greetings from the epicenter of the polar vortex. In the fourth quarter, the ITW team delivered solid earnings growth and margin expansion. Fourth quarter EPS was in line with the midpoint of our guidance and increased 8%, 10% excluding currency with operating margin up 70 basis points to 24%, and after-tax return on invested capital up 320 basis points to over 27%. For the full-year, the ITW team delivered high-quality earnings growth of 15%, record operating income, record operating margin, and record return on invested capital.","Free cash flow was up 10%, and we invested over $600 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. In addition, we returned more than $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Throughout 2018, we continue to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy, as evidenced by 110 basis points of margin improvement from our Enterprise Initiatives over the course of the year. We made really good progress on organic growth acceleration in better than half of our operating divisions.","As we discussed in our Investor Day back in December, our focus now is on getting the other 36 of our divisions that are not yet growing to their potential, moving more briskly down that path. And it's a major focus for us in the next couple of years. There's no doubt that 2018 had its challenges, raw material cost inflation, tariff uncertainties, decelerating auto production and currency headwinds in the back half of the year.","Our ability to power through these challenges and deliver another year of record results, as evidence of the performance power of the ITW business model and the resilience of our high-quality diversified business portfolio. As we head into 2019, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver another year of meaningful progress down the path to ITW's full potential and to our 2023 performance goal.","Before I turn the call over to Michael, let me conclude by recognizing and thanking my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence.","Michael, over to you.","Michael Larsen","Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Let's stay on Slide 5 and recap a few more highlights for the fourth quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.83, an increase of 8% as we managed through some international end markets softness in two segments: the solid execution and delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance. Organic revenue was up 1%, with solid 4% growth in North America, offset by a 2% decline in international markets.","I'll provide some additional color on what we saw in North America and international markets in a couple of minutes.","PLS was 90 basis points this quarter, a little bit above our full-year rate of 70 basis points. Operating margin performance was solid as margins improved 70 basis points, with 110 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives, lower price\/cost margin dilution headwind. Finally, free cash flow increased 18% to $727 million, 120% of net income and we repurchased $500 million of our shares in the quarter.","Moving to Slide 6 for detail on fourth quarter operating margin. We've expanded operating margin every quarter this year and the fourth quarter was no different. In fact, we did better than last quarter, with 70 basis points of improvement year-over-year versus 30 basis points in Q3.","All year, our teams have continued to execute well in Enterprise Initiatives, consistently contributing 100 basis points or more of margin improvement every quarter. And the impact is broad-based. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Initiatives benefits ranged from 80 basis points to 120 basis points across each one of our seven segments.","As I mentioned, price\/cost margin dilution improved, narrowing from 70 basis points in the second quarter to 60 basis points in the third quarter, and now 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. Throughout the year, we continue to take decisive pricing actions to offset cost inflation and tariff impact.","As planned, on a dollar basis, price more than offset raw material costs this quarter and for the full-year. All in, operating margin expanded by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter to 24%, the highest Q4 operating margin in ITW's history.","Now we'll look at segment performance, starting with Slide 7. The table on the left provide some additional color on our fourth quarter organic growth rates by segment and by region. As I mentioned, North America continued its solid growth pattern with 4% this quarter, similar to third quarter and first half of the year. North America has really been steady and strong all year, ending the year up 4%.","You can see some really good organic growth numbers in North America, with for example, Food Equipment, Welding, both up 7%; Polymers & Fluids, up 6%. For the full-year, every segment delivered positive organic growth in North America, ranging from 2% to 11%.","International was more of a challenge, specifically in two segments, with organic growth down 2% in the fourth quarter, compared to up 2% in the first half of the year. The international market challenges that we're experiencing are not broad-based, and relate to just two segments, Automotive OEM and Specialty.","Excluding those two segments, our international growth rate in Q2 would have been 4 points higher at plus 2%. More on that in the next few Slides. I should just point out that China overall was down slightly, at minus 2%, with again lower sales in automotive and specialty only.","The other five segments saw positive demand trends as evidenced by, for example, Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 12%; Welding up 22%; and Polymers & Fluids, up 9%. For the full-year, China was up 3%.","Let's go into the segment details, starting with Automotive OEM. Organic growth was down 4% this quarter. North America being positive 2% was not enough to offset a meaningful reduction in build rates in Europe and China.","For the full-year, Automotive OEM organic growth was flat, as the auto builds in regions that are relevant to ITW all declined. If you look at 2018's full-year organic growth compared to builds by region, we delivered significant above-market growth in two of our key markets, North America and China.","In North America, we grew 3% versus builds down 1%. And in China, organic growth was 3% versus builds down 4%. In Europe, the implementation of mandated new emissions testing procedures in Q3 caused significant auto production disruption in the back half of the year.","We're confident that our below build rate revenue declines in the second half are a function of mix, what models passed the new emissions testing procedures and when, and not the result of any material share loss. Our new program wins in Europe in 2018 were very strong as is our new program pipeline there. We remained confident that our European auto businesses are well positioned to deliver consistent above market growth and that they will get back to doing so over the next several quarters.","With respect to the European market production issues I referenced a minute ago; our auto team on the ground expects that they will work themselves through over the next several quarters, and that conditions will begin to normalize in the back half of the year. Fourth quarter operating margin declined 150 basis points almost entirely due to price cost headwinds.","As you know, pricing actions take longer to implement in the automotive market. It is encouraging though that for the full-year; this segment's operating margin of 22.5% was down only 30 basis points with the benefits from Enterprise Initiatives, essentially offsetting price\/cost headwinds.","Moving on to Slide 8. Food Equipment had a strong quarter and delivered accelerating organic revenue growth of 5%, its highest quarterly growth in four years as overall demand continued to improve across the board. North America grew 7%, with equipment up 9%, and service up 4%. Food service was up 11% and retail i.e. sales to grocery stores, turned positive as we began to lap difficult comps that we've talked about on prior calls.","Growth in institutional end markets continues to be very strong, and was up double digits, with particular strength in the education and lodging categories. International markets were solid too, up 3% with good growth in both equipment and service.","As expected, Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was flat against the tough comp of 9% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Test & Measurement was down 1% due to this difficult year-over-year comparison. Electronics was up 2%. While this quarter had a tough comp, full-year organic growth was solid at plus 4% and I should point out that fourth quarter operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 24.8%, a record for the segment.","Now on to Slide 9. Welding continued its strong run, with 8% organic growth this quarter, which is impressive versus a comp of 6% growth last year. Demand was strong across-the-board, with global equipment up 7% and consumables up 8%. Industrial business was up 7%, commercial up 8%, and oil and gas, up 9%.","By region, North America was up 7%; and international, up 11%. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 4% with 7% growth in automotive aftermarket, which benefited from a new product launch. And Polymers was up 4%, with strong product sales at Asia Pacific, offsetting a 4% decline in Fluids, which included a significant amount of PLS and a tough comp at plus 5% last year.","Turning to Slide 10. Construction organic sales were down 1%, as our North American commercial sales were down 10%, primarily due to project timing in our warehouse growing business. North America residential was essentially flat, with 5% growth in renovation and remodel, offset by decline in new construction. Europe was a bright spot with sales up 6%.","Australia and New Zealand sales were down 5% due to a slowing residential construction market there. Specialty organic sales were down 2% against the tough comp of plus 5% last year. This segment also had over 100 basis points of PLS in the quarter. International organic sales were down 8% with some of the same soft spots that we saw in the third quarter, including appliance components and graphics. Equipment sales were a bright spot, up 4%, and our Hi-Cone division, which we saw at our Investor Day, was up 13%. ","Moving on to Slide 11 and full-year 2018 performance. 2018 was a record year for EPS, operating income, operating margin of 24.3% and after-tax return on invested capital of 28.2%. Operating margin was up 60 basis points, driven primarily by another year of strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives, contributing 110 basis points.","Free cash flow was up 10% to $2.4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 95%, slightly below our target, primarily due to the combination of modestly higher CapEx investments and slightly elevated inventory levels at year-end due to higher material costs. Finally, we executed $2 billion in share repurchases and increased the dividend by 28% this year.","Looking back at 2018. We delivered on the full-year EPS guidance that we provided as we entered the year, thus continuing our track record of exceeding our annual guidance for the past 6 years. The consistency and quality of our financial performance as summarized here for 2018 are a testament to the power of ITW's proprietary business model, our high-quality diversified business portfolio and strong execution by the ITW team.","Let's now turn to Slide12 in 2019 guidance. We are reiterating our full-year EPS guidance from Investor Day in December. EPS of $7.90 to $8.20, with a midpoint of $8.05, which represents 6% growth year-over-year. We now expect organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, compared to a range of 2% to 4% previously. This reduction is entirely related to taking a more conservative, risk-adjusted view with regards to auto builds and semiconductor-related demand in 2019.","This range also includes PLS of about 80 basis points, which is unchanged from December. We continue to firm up the projects and activities related to our Enterprise Initiatives, and are confident that they will deliver 100 basis points of operating margin expansion, independent of volume.","Also, included in our plan are higher restructuring expense versus 2018 and we have particularly heavy restructuring agenda in Q1. This is driven to a significant degree by actions we are taking to rightsize our automotive OEM and specialty businesses in Europe. The price\/cost equation remains pretty dynamic, but margin headwinds should continue to moderate as the majority of raw material costs appear to have stabilized, and we have strong pricing momentum heading into the year, with the vast majority of planned pricing actions already implemented.","2019 tariff expectations remain around $60 million, which is based on current and announced tariffs, including the potential impact of these three growing from 10% to 25% in March. We continue to view the overall tariff impact as manageable, given the fact that we are largely a produce where we sell company, and that we only source approximately 2% of our spend from China.","Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost inflation and tariff impacts that might arise in 2019, with pricing actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis at a minimum, just as we did in 2018. Finally, we expect free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income, share repurchases of $1.5 billion and a tax rate in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%, up slightly from 24.5% in 2018 due to the non-repeat of discrete items.","Taking a closer look at the first quarter. We should point out that we expect that the first half of 2019 will be a little more challenging that what is typical for us in terms of year-over-year comparisons due to more difficult comps, more currency headwind in the first half versus the second half of the year and higher Q1 restructuring costs.","Specifically, in Q1, we have a $0.07 of currency headwind at current rates. The impact of the higher restructuring also $0.07, and $0.05 of tax rate headwind due to a discrete $14 million tax item that we recognized in Q1 of last year. There's also one last shipping day in Q1, which is another approximately $0.02 headwind to EPS and 1.5 percentage points headwind to organic growth. It's important to note that we have an extra shipping day in Q3.","As a result, we expect Q1 EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.83, and essentially flat organic growth. However, coming out of Q1, the headwinds I just described start to moderate. Roughly two-thirds of $0.14 of the expected currency headwind this year is in the first half.","Restructuring activities, as we discussed, are front-end loaded this year, and price\/cost margin impact should moderate as we go through the year. It\u2019s important to note that our full-year guidance is based entirely on current demand run rates.","Existing and announced price\/cost impacts, known enterprise initiative benefits, and what we believe is a prudently risk-adjusted posture with regard to 2019 demand expectations in auto and semiconductor end-to-end markets.","We do not have any projections of demand improvement versus current levels in our 2019 guidance. However, given what I just described and the fact that revenue comps are much easier in the second half of the year, year-over-year revenue and earnings growth comparisons will get increasingly positive as we move through the year.","On Slide 13, we provided an EPS range for 2019 versus 2018. Organic growth of 1% to 3% at our normal incremental margin of 35%, contributes to $0.20 to $0.30 to EPS growth.","Benefits from Enterprise Initiatives add another $0.25 to $0.35. Lower share count represents the impact on the $2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the $1.5 billion planned for 2019. Combined, they contribute approximately $0.25 a share. At current exchange rates, we anticipate $0.20 impact from foreign currency and approximately two-thirds of that impact is expected in the first half of the year as we talked about.","And finally, we proved a few things and to other on this bridge. It includes our expectations to higher restructuring this year, approximately $0.10, with $0.07 of that in Q1; a higher tax rate than 2018 due to the non-repeat of discrete items, which is a $0.05 headwind, partially offset by lower interest expense due by savings and the $1.35 billion in bond maturities in March and April. These three items and a few other puts and takes, combined to reduce EPS by $0.10 to $0.20.","You will know that there's no accommodations of potential M&A activity and specifically the potential divestitures that we talked about at Investor Day. Our guidance is all in, meaning, that the baseline presented here assumes our portfolio as it is today.","We are making good progress on our potential divestitures, and we'll update you on our progress as we go through the year. Importantly, as we said before, any EPS dilution from divestitures will be completely offset by incremental share repurchases, and are therefore, EPS-neutral.","Finally, we have provided our views on organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2019 on Slide 14. These are based on current run rates, adjusted for seasonality, and are obviously influenced by year-over-year comparisons as we go through the year.","It's important to note that there's no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance. We see solid growth in Welding of 3% to 6%, down from 2018, but just as a function of the more difficult 10% comparison year-over-year.","Food Equipment has good momentum and pretty easy comps in the first half, and are expected to be up 3% to 5% for the full year. Construction of 1% to 4%, which also includes a number of meaningful new product launches.","Test & Measurement incorporates a more cautious sales expectation for equipment related to semiconductor manufacturing. Those sales represent approximately $200 million, and are expected to be down double-digits in 2019. This creates a drag of 2 percentage points of organic growth to the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment.","Polymers & Fluids and Specialty, all with low single-digit growth expectation, and automotive, as we mentioned, we are being pretty cautious with sales expected to be flat to down 4% despite the fact that third parties, such as IHS, are expecting positive growth in auto builds in 2019.","Lastly, a comment about quarterly guidance. From day one back in 2013, our strategy has been centered on leveraging ITW's powerful and proprietary business model to its full potential, and in doing so, position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns over the long-term.","In the early stages of implementing our strategy, we believe that providing quarterly guidance was constructive given the number and magnitude of the changes and initiatives that we were implementing across the company. We have not progressed far enough in executing our strategy that you believe that providing quarterly guidance is no longer value added given the long-term performance focus of the company and our core shareholders.","As a result, we are discontinuing this practice as of this quarter. We will continue to provide an updated five-year performance goals and EPS and organic growth guidance annually.","With that, Karen, back to you.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. Thanks, Michael. Sheryl, let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andrew Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Andrew Casey","Your guidance is pretty interesting. It looks like topline is more or less consistent with a bear case on the stock, but the bottom line guide is what you said back in December. So a couple of questions on the backend loaded nature of what you just presented. First, why is price\/cost negative 50 bps for the year, given pricing momentum is carrying over? And from the outside, it looks like you're looking at apparent decreases in some of your raw material input costs and then within that, do you expect price\/cost to improve through the year?","Michael Larsen","Yes. Andy, price\/cost was negative 50 basis points from a margin standpoint in 2018 and we're not providing a number for 2019 primarily because it's still a pretty dynamic environment in terms of raw materials as well as potential tariffs. That said, what you are saying is correct. I mean it is reasonable to assume based on what we know today in terms of the price actions we've taken, the expected raw material costs, the tariffs including the increase in March from 10% to 25% that may or may not happen.","It is reasonable to assume that we will continue to make progress on price\/cost from a margin standpoint in 2019 and certainly, we will continue to be positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis to a degree that\u2019s significantly higher actually that what we saw in 2018. So I hope that answers your question.","Andrew Casey","It does. And if I can also follow-up on something else, Michael, thank you for that. In your commentary around the first half versus second half, Q1 midpoint implies about 6% earnings decline year-over-year, but the rest of the year is up around 9%. It sound pretty confident that in assuming the current run rate. Is a majority of that confidence really related to the pull ahead of the seven out of 10 for restructuring in the year into Q2? And basically, is that the big part of your confidence?","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think what we're pulling forward, the restructuring obviously has a pretty big impact here in Q1 of $0.07. Some of those benefits will start to show up in the back end of the year. Many of these projects have one-year payback or better in many cases. In addition to the higher restructuring, currency is more of a headwind in Q1, the tax rate is a headwind. And then we do have one less shipping day as I mentioned in Q1. And so\u2026","Scott Santi","That we get back in Q3.","Michael Larsen","That we get back in Q3. So that's why the year looks a little different relative to what you're used to from ITW, but there is some really good reasons behind that. And when you pencil it all out, you can get comfortable. We certainly are comfortable and very confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we are providing today.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Sounds good. Thank you very much.","Scott Santi","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. I wonder if I can just dig into a couple of segment level detail questions. First on automotive and the whole emissions, WLTC had a logjam in Europe. Your view that it doesn't really sort itself up in the second half, is that kind of a well grounded in what you're hearing from the OEMs? Or is that really kind of just kind of caution on the chaos we've seen up to this point and it's just kind of hard to predict how things play out there?","Scott Santi","I think it's a little bit of both, but more of the latter. I want to be careful how I say this, but I think the information has, in terms of direct customer, that's been a little bit up and down just because I think it's a fairly fluid situation. But I think our posture from a planning standpoint, we believe is definitely on the conservative side and just to be clear, we're saying that things start to mitigate in the back half of normalized, but certainly aren't all the way corrected probably and it will begin with some elements of this all the way through the year is our current view.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. And just on the Construction side. I'm sorry, can you elaborate on what drove the commercial weakness in North America and the U.S.? And is there kind of visibility on the recovery plan there?","Michael Larsen","Yes, there is. So it's a fairly small part of our overall business in North America. Part of what we do is we provide concrete solutions for warehouse flooring. And we had a number of projects that we're scheduled to go in Q4 that pushed out to 2019, so it's just primarily a timing issue more than a commentary on what's going on in the commercial construction space.","Jeffrey Sprague","And maybe just one other really quick follow-up. Do you have some additional restructuring kind of on-the-shelf, for lack of a better term, if kind of the macro environment does begin to pick it on as soon as 2019 unfolds?","Scott Santi","Well, I would say, we normally operate with a fair degree of contingency planning around our plans, whether that's within a particular segment or at the overall company level. We certainly have the flexibility to make adjustments as we're talking about here related to auto and specialty in the near term. And that's been sort of normal practice for the company for quite a long time.","So should things in terms of sort of external and macro environment play out differently than what we're anticipating now, and again, I think we're taking a pretty conservative posture in terms of our planning approach here. And absolutely, we would expect to be able to adjust to that and do it in a relatively short order. As I said, we have a pretty flexible cost structure given how we operate to maybe 2020. So we could certainly make those adjustments within the quarter or two.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Appreciate the perspective. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. First, I just wanted to better understand if we think about what \u2013 your preliminary guide at the Analyst Meeting, the EPS is the same as it is today. Basically, reaffirmed it, but your organic growth assumption is 1 point worse. I don't recall of the restructuring number was in there and also FX seems to be more of a headwind. So can you just sort of help me understand what's offsetting those headwinds relative to what you guys said at the Analyst Day?","And then my second question is just with regards to the organic growth, the 2% for this year. One would argue in 2018 where the economy was relatively strong. You guys put up the same level of organic growth. So just comfort level on you can put together \u2013 or you can put up another 2% organic growth in a tougher macro. Thank you.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So let me start with the first part, which is a very fair question, in terms of the organic growth guide today being lower than what we guided in December. Really on the back of being more conservative around automotive builds as well as factoring in the latest view on the semiconductor-related end markets.","As we've gone through these last few months here, we really firmed up our views in terms of the enterprise savings from \u2013 Enterprise Initiatives to specific projects and activities that will deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement as well as other discretionary cost items.","And so that's really what's driving the majority of our confidence and ability to maintain the EPS number. In addition to that, I would say, although I'm cautious on this, given what we saw in 2018 as the price\/cost headwinds are certainly looking more favorable today than at the end of last year.","And then just to be precise, restructuring, I think, that we had in our guidance in December is the same number as today. And so that number has not changed. I think the second part, if I remember correctly, was around our ability \u2013 confidence to deliver 1% to 3% organic growth this year similar to last year.","And I'll go back to how we modeled this, which is basically based on current run rates, adjusted for seasonality, and if you run that out for the year, with the adjustments we made in auto and specialty, you get to a range of 1% to 3% organic growth.","We provided a little more detail on the last slide, Slide 14, in the deck. You can see how it kind of pencils out by segment. And again, these are based on current run rates, risk-adjusted on a couple of areas, and in our view, pretty cautious and conservative view overall.","Jamie Cook","I guess, so just given the account of the weaker macro, there are certain segments where you are assuming that your market share is above average and that sort of helps the organic growth? I mean, can you talk about Construction little? I'm not sure if market share is contributing more, I mean, relative to just overall whatever macro? Thanks.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think Construction, there's significant new product launches on the docket for this year. I'd say in addition to that, I wouldn't underestimate the impact of price this year relative to 2018. And so if you add all that up, these are the numbers that make up the guidance by segment and 1% to 3% in total.","Jamie Cook","Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Michael Larsen","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz, Citibank. Go ahead, your line in open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hear me okay?","Michael Larsen","Yes. We got you.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yes. So Scott or Mike obviously ITW's is relatively strong in Europe, and you did mention that Europe would be up a couple of percent instead of down if it weren't for your issues in auto. And Specialty Products, so maybe give us a little more color regarding what\u2019s going on in Europe. Construction actually looks like strong for you, guys, given the environment there. And so and what's the outlook here as we go through 2019 in Europe?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think the issues on the international side are really isolated to the two segments we talked about. I think the other five segments are doing pretty well across the Board. If you just look at the fourth quarter, certainly, auto, specialty were down, but we put up some really good numbers in Europe.","Construction overall was up 6%. Welding, up 7%. Food, up 3%. We've not seen a big impact from Brexit or the U.K. Those markets are pretty stable. So we feel pretty confident going into 2019 in terms of modeling current run rates in that geography.","Scott Santi","You just may be \u2013 yes, just another data point is, and if you net \u2013 if you look at our European sales in Q3 and Q4 net of auto and specialty, it was plus 3 in Q3 and plus 2 in Q4, so we're certainly not \u2013 which feels pretty stable to us not \u2013 the 3% to 2% I don\u2019t know, we're certainly not calling that a trend. But sort of down single-digit is pretty sold.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yes. Okay, that\u2019s helpful guys. And then a couple of businesses that have been somewhat lethargic over the last couple of quarters, they looked like they kicked up a little bit here in this past quarter. If I look at Polymers & Fluids and you mentioned that new product intro and auto aftermarket. And then with include equipment that you mentioned retail reconfiguration turning around.","Do these businesses have some sustaining power here going forward? In other words, are you seeing a little bit more CapEx from grocery stores, for instance, in Food Equipment and does this new product rollout in auto aftermarket? Does that give you continuing growth in the segment for the next few quarters?","Michael Larsen","Yes. I\u2019d say Andy that Food Equipment certainly feels very good. I think the acceleration really started in the second half. The strength is broad-based. On the equipment side, service put up a pretty good number here as well. On the retail side, just to be clear, we're not seeing a pickup in terms of the CapEx spend on the grocery side. Really, what we're seeing is, these are flat to up slightly on a year-over-year basis as we lapped a more difficult comps.","But all the benefits that we expected in terms of new product introductions, certainly, we're seeing though in the second half of the year and we expect those to continue into 2019. So Food Equipment, let say, 3% to 5% feels very good for 2019. Polymers & Fluids, we did benefit from a new product launch in automotive aftermarket. I hesitate to say this, but we\u2019re a beneficiary also of some weather-related impact in terms of Rain-X wiper blades.","And so that part of the business was up 7% overall. That is not a sustainable rate for the full-year, obviously. But I'd say also in Polymers, you're seeing some good progress there in terms of the overall organic growth rate. And like I mentioned earlier, you are seeing the impact of price. So certainly some good progress in those two segments and we should expect to continue to see that in 2019 as reflected in the segment outlook we gave you on Page 14.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciated guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open.","Mircea Dobre","Yes. Good morning, guys. So I want to stick with Food Equipment here. I mean, 3% to 5% growth this would probably be the best growth since 2014, 2015, that time range. And I wanted to make sure that I understand kind of what the moving pieces are here. Retail, you said, feels a little bit better, but it's mostly a factor of comps. So I'm not sure how much you're really expecting this business to grow. Institutional, you mentioned, was quite good, so maybe you can talk a little bit about the momentum into 2019? I'm also wondering just your restaurant business, so I think that's pretty meaningful as well. How that's doing international as well as North America?","Michael Larsen","Yes, Mig. So the demand we saw really here in Q3, Q4 was broad-based. So we talked specifically about food service, which is everything excluding the retail side, being up 11%. Retail turned positive in the no single-digits. We're not counting on a big pickup in retail in 2019 and it's not that significant portion of our overall business. We continue to see a lot of strengths on the institutional side, up double-digits. And again, there are a couple of categories here, really, around education, so K12, universities as well as lodging.","And on the restaurant side also, double-digit growth, including which for us is a smaller part of the business on the QSR side. International is solid, up 3%. Certainly feel good about the momentum going into 2019. And just Q4 was best growth rate I think in over four years here. So new product introductions are really taking off and we feel we're very pleased with the progress we're making in Food Equivalent.","Mircea Dobre","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then sort of going back to the big picture topline guidance, so if you're starting the year flat in Q1 and you're guiding on current levels of TAM, and your comp is getting tougher in Q2 by at least 100 basis points. Should we have expectations for an organic decline in Q2, and then acceleration in the second half on easier comps? Is that how we should be thinking about it?","Michael Larsen","So Mig, you should definitely think about it as just given the comps higher growth rates in the back half of the year than in the first half. If you just go back and look at 2018, I think in 2018, we were up 3% organic rounding in the first half were up 1% in the second half.","That alone is driving some of the higher growth rates, both in terms of organic as well as well as earnings growth. So really the swings you're going to see are really a function of what the comps are on a year-over-year basis. Those are the big drivers. Again, there's no demand acceleration assumed here on the contrary, if anything, we've dialed it back in certainly in auto as well as semi, which we talked about earlier.","Mircea Dobre","But there is not something on the products side or \u2013 I don\u2019t know something it based on some of the visibility that you might have that would be able to maybe reassure us that you'd be able to cross the tougher comp in Q2 versus Q1?","Michael Larsen","There is typical every year, new products contribute\u2026","Scott Santi","And we are not managed for the quarter. The quarterly plans, we'll give you a Q2 update when we get there. Our expectation is, again, as Michael said, were recent current demand levels and projecting them through the year. I'm \u2013 if you look at Q2 this was a full-year in a Q1 number. I don't recall exactly what the Q2 organic growth rate is embedded in our plan if we had it, and so I think\u2026","Mircea Dobre","No, I appreciate it. I was just trying to make sure that we have already much better line what you guys are thinking. That\u2019s it?","Scott Santi","I think the math is \u2013 there's nothing funny in the math here. This is really straightforward, as Michael said, if anything have to dialed back relative to current demand rates in a couple of areas where we think there's some potential risks. We're not seeing that it's going to play out that way. I think overall, that's a smart and prudent approach in terms of our planning.","And it also highlights the fact that we've got a lot of earnings growth power from the same point of Enterprise Initiatives and other things going on underneath that's not vulnerable to some further erosion in auto, if things play out. And ultimately, we've got to plan where we believe there's more upside potential than downside. That's why we always plan and that's really what were, I think, embedded in the approach we've taken in terms of taken the organic growth rate down a percent relative to where we were in December.","Mircea Dobre","Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch, Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","John Inch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Michael Larsen","Good morning.","John Inch","Hi, Michael. So wondering if there's kind of an update on the divestitures that you plan for this year? And just as kind of to that, Michael, if we were actually to have taken the 2019 divestitures that you've got out and best of them at the beginning of the year, kind of pro forma, would that have any material impact on the 1% to 3% core growth that you're just betting for 2019?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So as that's a very good question. So the impact is these potential divestitures all happen is an improvement in our organic growth rate of about 50 basis points and improvement in our operating margins by 100 basis points. So that would \u2013 assuming that all of those take place this year, that's what we would expect to see in 2020. I think that's a fairly optimistic assumption.","I think we're certainly making good progress, and I think a more reasonable planning assumption would be maybe half of them get done this year. But none of that is included in the numbers today. So certainly you see some slightly lower revenues to the effect that if EPS dilution, you'll see higher share repurchases to offset that, so that they are EPS-neutral. There are going to be some gains on some of these potential divestitures. Those are also not included, but on pro forma basis, it's a meaningful impact. And we are making good progress.","John Inch","If there's some reason you couldn't \u2013 I know you said half, but it's not a bad point, right? But to some reason, if you start to get a cadence going because I'm assuming you're not doing them sequentially one after another, you got kind have booked out more than one. I mean, why couldn\u2019t these things hit sooner? Is it just \u2013 I guess I don't really understand why it \u2013 there's not a lot of companies like why couldn't we get most of this done in 2019?","Michael Larsen","I will pass that on to the steering committee in charge of the divestiture activities, John. We prioritized in terms of the biggest impact of the company. We\u2019re going to try to get those done first. We\u2019re not in a rush here. We\u2019re going to be very liberate and thoughtful in terms of how we execute of this and maximizing the value for the company and so\u2026","Scott Santi","I'll just quibble a little bit with your perspective in terms of there \u2013 there is a decent amount of work involved in each one in terms of preparing to separate from ITW and all the things we need to do to\u2026","John Inch","Yes, I look in the ivory tower, so I guess.","Scott Santi","I don't want to go to that part, John, but I was just \u2013 I think we've got a good cadence, we've got good plans that we are finalizing now in terms of being very deliberate and intentional how bad \u2013 how we go bad if as Michael said, I think the reality of it is probably a two-year process to move all the way through maybe. And of course, everything that we can do to make it happen faster, we will certainly do that. But at this point, we also are not \u2013 that's not the number one priority right now. So would everything else that we are trying to work on and make progress there.","John Inch","And just sort on the polymers business, I know Michael, you called out the auto aftermarket likely not to see that cadence, that make sense. Was there any kind of a pre-buy in that business maybe associated with getting ahead of some cost increases or price increases? That\u2019s also potentially contributing to the 1% to 3% kind of slight acceleration?","Michael Larsen","John, we did not see that in Polymers & Fluids. And actually, in any of our other segments as we went through the fourth quarter here. The quarter played out as it usually does on a monthly basis. There's really nothing unusual, as we went through the quarter, including in Polymers & Fluids.","John Inch","The other question I had is oil and gas prices have come down obviously, since the December meeting. I know we're talking about raw increases, but I was wondering about the indirect impact or even direct impact of those hydrocarbon pricings coming down? I realize you buy a lot of metals, like, in metals derivatives. But is there possibly some sort of once we get the impact of this, is there some sort of potential net tailwind that kind of begins to accrue to you later this year or something?","Michael Larsen","Eventually, the answer is yes. I don\u2019t know whether that will be end of this year or not. I mean there is certainly a tailwind today on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as I said earlier, while raw material costs increases \u2013 just carryover from last year is still pretty significant number in 2019. Its leg than 2018 and we are certainly significantly ahead on a dollar-for-dollar basis. So with the standard, it is providing some tailwind here.","John Inch","Got it. One last one, I mean company is used to talk about \u2013 I think they still do selectively kind of these cost pressures that are embodied by wages. If you just focus on the U.S., what's actually happening to your U.S. wage costs given \u2013 what appeared to be tight employment markets? I mean, our wages going up materially in 2019 I don\u2019t remember if you call back out, materially 2019 versus 2018. Is that any kind of the factor here?","Michael Larsen","We have not \u2013 I think there would be \u2013 from the standpoint of aggregate, North American wages. I am summarizing a lot of individual data points, but things are up tens of thousands of points maybe relative to sort of plan increases in prior year, but nothing that I would considered to be material in terms of the impact of the overall company at this point.","John Inch","Got it, talk it. All right, thanks guys. Appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Gilardi. You\u2019re line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Hey good morning. Thanks guys. Just on auto, I think you said that you're assuming flat to negative 4% for 2019. Can you give us any type of breakdown by region particular since you were saying that you\u2019re not assuming any acceleration in the second half? I would just think given like what's going on in China right now to get the flat to negative 4% and just the pressures in that end market globally that you would have assume some re-acceleration for now to be down more than that.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So there is a lot of uncertainty around the numbers that third parties are providing on a geographic basis. I think the best I can tell you is, when we were together in December, the view was is that our auto business will be flat on markets that globally would be down 2% to 3%. We gave that a further risk adjustment here relative to what we said in December. I can't really give you a view by quarter here as the year plays out. I'll give you the actuals, when we get through Q2, Q3 and Q4, but I can't really give you guidance around that.","Scott Santi","We got people studied this, like IHS out with a projection of plus 2% on builds on China for the year, plus 1% in North America and I think down a couple \u2013 I think certainly, globally they're plus 1%, we\u2019re at 0% to minus 4%. It\u2019s just one data point, but there are people that study this that have \u2013 I\u2019ll call it an optimistic view, but I think we're back to them.","The comment we are making earlier about making sure that we're appropriately conservative there where there's still some uncertainty, but we're not, I don't think we're on the high side of optimism relative to what most of this, at least third parties that we look at to study this market feel like it's going to go on in 2019. We're on the conservative side of them.","Ross Gilardi","Just on the restructuring, the $0.07 and I think the $0.10 for the year, what is it actually for? I mean, is it headcount related or is it five-year enterprise initiatives? And I think you mentioned before, but where is it again? ","Michael Larsen","So this is primarily focused on rightsizing our footprint in Europe in two businesses, the automotive business as well as the specialty business. And beyond that we typically don't comment on specific restructuring projects.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. But on that, Michael, I mean, you said that, I mean, clearly there's some pressures tied to what you were describing earlier, but it sounded like you thought things were normalizing that you're not losing share and it's kind of a timing issue of when the market actually improves. So why restructure the European auto business if that's the case?","Michael Larsen","Well, we're just moving faster on some things. We still got an acquisition that we did two years ago that is through the restructuring I would say, is normally \u2013 normal part of the integration of that business. It\u2019s a fairly good piece of that. We are accelerating some of that given the environment in this pause and demand, it's a good time to get after some of that.","Well there's some things that would have been \u2013 we would have gotten to anyway. It\u2019s the easiest way to describe it that I would say we have accelerated into the front-end of the year given the pause and the demand admit. These things are in some ways is better timing if we can get them done when we're not also dealing with some increases in demand. That's probably a better characterization of it.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Got you.","Michael Larsen","That's what we're doing.","Ross Gilardi","And just the last one on the Test & Measurement. I mean you guys leaked out 140 basis points of margin expansion with real organic growth in the business in the fourth quarter, which is pretty impressive. But is that type of margin expansion sustainable in the 2019 in a flattish environment for that segment?","Michael Larsen","I think we still have ways to go in terms of further margin expansion in Test & Measurement and that's based on what the bottoms up, what the team is telling us. What you're really seeing is the impact of the enterprise initiatives in Test & Measurement. And I think it's another data point that supports the view that we have and the confidence that we have in the ability to continue to expand margins in 2019 and beyond as we talked about in December. We believe we have at least another 3 to 4 percentage points of margin expansion ahead of us and Test & Measurement has at least that level of improvement ahead of it in that over the next three to four years.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joseph Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Joseph Ritchie","So just on your WLTP comments from earlier, I just wanted to make sure that I understand it. If your platforms are being disproportionately impacted, do you have a sense or line of sight on the approval for those platforms getting through the testing requirements? And shouldn't that just reversed itself at some point in 2019?","Scott Santi","Well, it should reverse itself at some point. The answer to your question is we don't have great line of sight because it's a new test and I don't want to speak for the auto OEMs in Europe, but what we're hearing is that there's some uncertainty and some challenges. It's not that it can't be done, it is a new testing procedure and that the backlog involved in getting all of their models through it has been much more of a challenge than perhaps what\u2019s expected. I don't know. I'm not, again, this is where we\u2019ll draw some conclusions over around based on a number of different data points.","So my answer to your question is absolutely, it should sort itself out. I think there's still a question of how long it takes to do so. And that's an element of our, let's call it conservatism in terms of our posture around that. There is people are still buying cars in Europe.","There's nothing in terms of their consumption data and auto that gives you a whole lot of reason for pause at least to us at this point. It's much more a bad for disruption and the production part relative to the emissions testing regime. And I don't think it's \u2013 smooth sailing from here, let's say in terms of how all that plays out. Based on what we hear.","Joseph Ritchie","That's fair, Scott. And I guess just a good quick pop follow-up that I had. You guys gave us guidance on the whole growth outlook for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Just wondering, and I know you've got the run rates, but the Electronics business I guess we've been seeing, yes, some softness channel and any color on that business specifically and what do you you're seeing in kind of perspective will be helpful.","Michael Larsen","Yes, most of our position in the electronic space is really more, I would say, MRO-related. So we're not \u2013 with a couple of exceptions, just one in set by we're not sort of upstream in terms of production equipment. So that from our standpoint the electronics has been pretty stable. But it's \u2013 but we're able to describe is pretty downstream from the standpoint of where we participate there.","Scott Santi","Yes. Clean room.","Michael Larsen","MRO.","Scott Santi","MRO activities.","Michael Larsen","Not production items. Right.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ann Duignan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Ann Duignan","Most of my questions have been asked. So I just philosophically, I just wanted to ask about the pulling that quarterly guidance. I'm just curious about timing and whether you talked to the fact that, without quarterly guidance probability is that the sale side estimates will be more variable and then you're more likely to miss somebody's expectations and therefore have greater earnings volatility, which actually meant covering multiple on a stopped. So I'm just curious why you chose to stop giving quarterly guidance.","Scott Santi","Well, since we haven't missed one in six years, we thought we would try something different. I'm just kidding. I think ultimately we talked a lot of our shareholders, and there's a fair amount of effort and it goes into providing it. There is some philosophical differences around again, what we think the core investor value proposition for ITW which is really around, strength of competitive advantage in the business model, resilience in terms of high quality, diversified portfolio.","All of those things are really oriented towards longer time periods of performance. And given all that, I think this is, we felt like we had, I think Michael said in his remarks, it was valuable early in the process given and talk about the enterprise strategy now. And then at this point we progressed far enough words, it's not value added anymore. And the last thing I would say and this will be a little smart key and I don't intend to be, but we listened to your boss. Jamie diamond has told us that. And a lot of companies we should be doing this. I'm just kidding.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fisher, UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Steven Fisher","Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the oil and gas question more from the revenue side of things? Just wondering to what extent you're seeing any change in momentum in the oil and gas business in the last two or three months or so. And then how that's filtering into your, primarily I guess the 3% to 6% growth in your Welding business.","Michael Larsen","Yes, our exposure is pretty limited overall to oil and gas. It's primarily on the international side in the Welding business. And we've just started to see a pickup in oil and gas here in Q3 and Q4. We gave you the number here. And we haven't seen any changes over the last couple of months, if that's what you're asking.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks. Good morning.","Michael Larsen","Good morning.","Nicole DeBlase","Given that some of the \u2013 I guess some of the commentary around why organic growth is a little bit lower for the full-year? Is semiconductor is electronic. I guess I\u2019m curious I don\u2019t think that came up in your commentary within T&M. Are you guys actually starting to see a slowdown in semiconductor spend? Or is it just anticipated to occur throughout 2019?","Michael Larsen","So we did see a slowdown here in Q4, not entirely on expected. And again it\u2019s in the portion of Test & Measurement that sells equipment for the upfront manufacturing of - in the semiconductor space. And we did see a slowdown here in Q4. In the past, there have been talks about pause, and then a pick up again in the back end of 2019. And we\u2019ve taken all that out and basically assumed current run rate based on what we saw in Q4 and, therefore in our view, appropriately, risk-adjusted for any exposure in semiconductor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Michael Larsen","Good morning.","Nathan Jones","Couple of follow-ups on the Welding business there, obviously, some good organic growth, but I know that business does sell a lot of steel. So maybe if you could give us some color on what the input is from volumes versus price, in the fourth quarter? And what the pricing tailwind to revenue, at least, is in 2019?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So Nathan, we do not break out price versus volume at the enterprise level or by segment, including for Welding. So I'm afraid I can\u2019t give you that.","Nathan Jones","Okay, no worries. Just one on the Construction business that you talked about new product releases on slide for this year. Can you talk about when you expect those to start hitting the market? And any color you could give on the anticipated contribution?","Michael Larsen","Yes, it\u2019s a pretty long list of new product centered around our cordless technology where ITW is the market leader. They come in throughout the year the various geographies. Typically, the contribution from new products is somewhere in the 1% range in terms of overall revenue growth and we it just based on what\u2019s in the pipeline to be a little bit higher than that in Construction this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys.","Michael Larsen","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just a follow-up on, Michael I guess the \u2013 part of the answer to your last question that you don't really want to break out price with the enterprise level. But it seems like some of the confidence in the year comes from maybe a bit more price yield and perhaps some commercial initiatives that offsets some of that auto commentary. Is that a fair assessment relative to prior years that you guys just feel like outside of, perhaps, auto that you're carrying a bit more price than usual and able to kind of a hold up, at least any downside scenario?","Michael Larsen","I don\u2019t know if we really thought about it that the way you\u2019re articulating it. I mean but certainly, like I said earlier, in six out of seven segments, so excluding auto, there's \u2013 we've taken pricing actions to offset raw material cost inflation and tariff impact. So to the extent that we'll probably have a little bit more price coming through in 2019 than in 2018 and that certainly helps the overall organic growth rate.","Scott Santi","But we offset price every year.","Michael Larsen","Yes, we get price every year. Maybe a little bit more 2019 and 2018, but it\u2019s not the big driver here.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Raso, Evercore ISI.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. I had another question, but just wanted to circle back first on the organic sales guide. I mean just want to make sure that the takeaway is correct. The idea of the first quarter being flat, the second quarter you do expect it to improve. I'm just making sure we are all level set just giving the idea if it's flat in the first quarter, if the second quarter is not at least one or two, it makes the second half obviously a little more of a struggle. So I just want to make sure we level set on that. So if you can give us some perspective.","But my real question, food and welding, the food and welding are going to be over 55% in dollar terms of your EBIT growth. I mean, sorry, the organic sales growth. In those businesses, good to see food pickup at least on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Can you give us any help with a backlog number, an order number, just something kind of looking into 2019 that gives us some perspective of the starting point of growth sort of already booked relative just given their significance to the overall growth for 2019?","Scott Santi","I'll answer the second and throw it back to Michael for the first. These are all short cycled businesses from the standpoint of \u2013 if we get an order today, we ship it tomorrow. What I can tell you is book-to-bill and both businesses in Q4 was positive. So order rates are at or above shipman rates in Q4. We don't build \u2013 these aren't big backlog businesses is my point. These are given the way we deliver. If we get an order today, we ship it tomorrow, we don't build backlog. But it's from the standpoint of just order rates relative to shipment rates in Q4 on both businesses were pretty solid.","Michael Larsen","Yes. That's where I was going to go with this, welding just grew organically 8%. On a tough comp, there were up 6% in Q4 last year. Food Equipment up 5%, organics have good momentum in those two businesses. In terms of the Q1, Q2 question, without telling you anything new really, I mean we did say that we have one that's shipping day in the first quarter, which lowers our overall organic growth rate by mathematically 1.5%. We do not have that headwind in Q2, so I don't know if that helps you in terms of what Q2 might look like. That\u2019s probably the best I can give you.","David Raso","Okay. I appreciate it. Just if you do 0%, 2% then it's 3.5%, 2.5%, it feels a little bit better than 0%... ","Michael Larsen","Yes. David, keep in mind that 1.5% in Q1 that mathematically we lose from one less day. We get that back in Q3.","David Raso","Exactly. I just want to make sure we weren't starting second quarter at one or less, so it just gets more challenging. But I appreciate it. Thank you so much.","Scott Santi","Sure.","Operator","Thank you.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. Yes, thank you, Sheryl. We've run a bit over.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Madison. And good morning. Welcome to ITW's second quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and update you on our earnings forecast.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 third quarter and full-year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on the slide. We refer you to the company's 2014 Form 10-K and first quarter 2015 Form 10-Q for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. In the face of a fairly unprecedented combination of currency translation headwinds and contracting demand in two of the company's highest growth core businesses, ITW delivered another solid quarter of execution with earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 7% over the last year. Excluding the $0.12 negative impact of currency translation, our earnings per share would have been up 17%. Operating margin in the quarter was up 80 basis points year-on-year, and operating margin of 21.3% was a new all-time record for the company. In addition, after-tax return on invested capital reached our Enterprise Strategy target of 20% plus.","Despite the current challenges associated with the external environment, we continue to focus on and invest in our strategy to accelerate organic revenue growth across the company. In the first half of 2015, we invested roughly $300 million in our businesses, as we added capital equipment to expand capacity, launched new products, and continued to simplify our businesses in order to focus them on their largest and most compelling growth opportunities. Our pivot and focus to organic growth is already delivering solid above-market growth in our Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments, and we saw nice improvement in the organic growth rate in our Construction segment this quarter. As a result, we now have three of our seven segments growing organically in the mid-to-upper single-digit range.","Revenues in our Welding segment and Test & Measurement platform were down significantly in Q2, Welding down 6% and Test & Measurement down 7%, as both businesses are seeing contracting demand from the oil and gas sector and the continued soft capital spending environment for industrial equipment more generally. Both of these businesses have traditionally been among ITW's fastest and most consistent organic growers, and we believe that the long-term fundamentals for growth and profitability in both of these businesses remain very strong. As a result, we continue to invest to ensure that they are well positioned to return to their historic growth rates as conditions in their end markets improve.","As we wrap up the second quarter of 2015, we are also at the halfway point of our five-year Enterprise Strategy. And while we have a lot of work left to do, we've made substantial progress in executing our strategy to position ITW to deliver solid above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns on capital. We've divested over 30 businesses including two full segments in conjunction with our portfolio strategy to focus the company exclusively on businesses that have strong and sustainable differentiation attributes.","Our business teams are currently executing the product line level component of this strategy through our product line simplification initiative. As a result, ITW today has a much more differentiated set of businesses with better overall earnings quality and significantly higher organic growth potential. As an aside and as an illustration of the significantly higher overall level of quality of the ITW business portfolio, last year, ITW's operating income of $2.9 billion was an all-time record for the company. The prior record of $2.8 billion was set in 2012 when the company's revenues were $3.4 billion higher. So in other words, last year, we made more money than we ever had in the history of the company and revenues that were $3.4 billion lower than the prior record.","Our focus now will increasingly turn to leveraging this much higher quality business portfolio into accelerated organic growth. Activities associated with business structure simplification are starting to lessen with significant incremental benefits still to come. Strategic sourcing is now fully embedded in our operations and delivering consistent above-plan benefits.","Organizationally, as the effort and attention required to mobilize, execute, and support these initiatives winds down over the next 18 months, we will be increasingly able to shift our focus towards leveraging our much more highly differentiated portfolio and to accelerate organic growth. Since we started executing on the Enterprise Strategy two and a half years ago, we have expanded operating margin and ROIC by more than 500 basis points, and we remain solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2017 performance goals of 23% operating margin, 20% plus after-tax ROIC, and organic growth of 200 basis points above global GDP.","I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Let's get started with the financial summary on page four. EPS for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of 7% versus prior year, and came in at the high end of our guidance range, driven by better margins and favorable currency relative to the exchange rates assumed in the guidance we provided on April 21. On a year-over-year basis, currency was a $0.12 headwind, and on a constant currency basis, EPS growth would have been 10 points higher at 17%.","Softness in the capital spending environment in oil and gas end markets in our Welding and Test & Measurement businesses resulted in essentially flat organic revenue, which was offset by record margin performance as Enterprise Initiatives again contributed 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. Revenues were $3.4 billion, up 0.2% organically after the expected 1% impact from product line simplification. Positively, we saw continued strong organic growth performance from our Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments at plus 6% and plus 4% respectively, and a nice acceleration in our organic growth rate in Construction of plus 6%. I'll cover the segments in a little bit more detail in a few slides.","Cash generation continues to be very good, free cash flow at $384 million, 80% of net income, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our target of 100% for the year. On capital allocation, we invested approximately $180 million in share repurchases and are on track for $2 billion for the year. Also really good progress in the after-tax return on invested capital, now solidly above our long-term target of 20% plus. In summary, excellent execution of our Enterprise Initiatives continues to deliver strong financial results in a challenging capital spending environment.","Turning to revenue by geography on page five, organic revenue was up slightly in North America and international, and up 1% excluding the impact of product line simplifications. Our businesses in EMEA continued to do well. EMEA was up 2% with another quarter of double-digit growth in Automotive OEM. Asia-Pacific was down 3% due to Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics partially offset by growth in Construction Products and Polymers & Fluids. China, which represents approximately 5% of total revenues, was down this quarter 2% due to Welding's oil and gas business. Our Automotive OEM business, however, was up 8% and continues to outperform the underlying market.","Overall, strong organic growth in three segments with Automotive, Food Equipment and now Construction Products joining the mix, offset by softer demand in our Industrial equipment businesses, Welding and Test & Measurement.","On page six, operating margin performance continues to be excellent with 21.3% this quarter being an all-time high for the company and 80 basis points better than last year. Operating margin improved in five of our seven segments with Food Equipment up 250 basis points, Construction up 170 basis points, and Polymers & Fluids up 130 basis points. Welding was down slightly and Specialty was down 70 basis points on a tough comparison versus prior year.","On the right side, you can see the key drivers of margin expansion this quarter with Enterprise Initiatives the primary driver with 100 basis points of positive impact as expected. Price\/cost was favorable 20 basis points, and other was a slight headwind due to a project in Specialty Products last year that did not repeat this year.","As you can see, 150 basis points of margin expansion in the first half as we target to exceed 21% operating margin for the year. Let me just point out that while first half revenues are down more than $500 million, operating income is essentially flat and EPS is up 13%, 23% on a constant currency basis. And so, overall, a lot of good things going on in terms of execution on so-called self-help in an external operating environment that remains challenging and somewhat uncertain.","Turning to page seven, we get into the segment results. And on the left side, we listed organic growth by segment for the first half of 2015. You can clearly see the three segments growing solidly at 6%, 4%, and 4% year-over-year, and you see the impact of the soft capital spending environment on our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. As Scott said, our Welding and Test & Measurement businesses have historically been strong above-market growth businesses. In fact, from 2010 to 2014, both businesses grew organic revenue at a 6% CAGR. As we've discussed previously, Specialty Products and Polymers & Fluids are still impacted by a significant amount of product line simplification.","Now let me give you some additional color by segment starting with Automotive OEM. Automotive OEM continues to leverage ITW's unique approach to innovation and drive product penetration gains for strong organic growth. As you can see, organic revenue in the second quarter was up 6% on flat worldwide auto builds. By geography, Europe continued to outperform with double-digit revenue growth; and in North America, the business was up 5%, again solidly above 2% auto builds. And in China, organic revenues grew 8%, outperforming auto builds also. Operating margin improved 80 basis points to 24.5%.","In our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, organic revenue declined 5% in the quarter. Organic revenue in Test & Measurement declined 7% due to the previously-discussed impact of the softer capital spending environment. And the Electronics business was down slightly at 3%. Operating margin for the segment increased 90 basis points to 16.1% in the quarter or 20.1% excluding the intangible amortization. In the appendix, we included the schedule with a margin impact of amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets by segment and in total.","Food Equipment organic growth was up 4% with North America Equipment up 9%, driven by new products and penetration gains in warewash, refrigeration, and cooking. Internationally, Equipment revenue was flat on a tough year-over-year comparison. Good performance in Service as revenues grew 5% in North America, 3% internationally. The segment's operating margin of 22% was 250 basis points higher than the prior year period, driven by strong execution of Enterprise Initiatives and growth from new products.","In the Polymers & Fluids segment, still a significant amount of product line simplification in the quarter, as organic revenue declined 2% while operating margin expanded by 130 basis points. Polymers was down 3%, Fluids & Hygiene was down 2%, and Automotive Aftermarket was flat.","Turning to Welding, this segment is clearly being impacted by softer demand on the equipment side, which represents two-thirds of the business. In addition, there is a fair amount of product line simplification this quarter, and as you can see, organic revenue was down 6%, as operating margin remained essentially flat above 26% and solidly best-in-class. As expected, demand for equipment in oil and gas related end markets remained soft in the quarter, very much in line with Q1 run rates. And in addition, the commercial business and the industrial businesses were impacted by the soft capital spending environment as well.","On slide 10, the Construction Products segment exceeded top line growth expectations this quarter with organic revenue growth of 6%, the highest growth rate in four years. North America is about 40% of the segment and led the way, up 15% with growth in all end markets particularly renovation and remodeling. Asia-Pacific increased 3% for the quarter, and Europe was down slightly, as strength in the United Kingdom was offset by softness in Continental Europe. Operating margin came in at 19.9%, an improvement of 170 basis points.","In Specialty Products, organic revenue was down 3% due in part to product line simplification. North America was down 5%, and International was down 1%. Operating margin fell slightly, but was still very good at 23.5%.","So that wraps up the segment discussion and now I'll turn to the outlook for the balance of the year on slide 11. As you saw this morning given the strong EPS performance in the quarter, we're raising our full-year EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint. We now expect full-year EPS of $5.07 to $5.23, which is 10% growth at the $5.15 midpoint. As a reminder, EPS for the year would be up 18% on a constant currency basis. Based on current demand trends, full-year organic revenue growth is expected to be approximately 1%, up 2% excluding the impact of product line simplification.","As you know, PLS remains a 1 percentage point drag throughout 2015 and then moderates starting in 2016. Total revenue is expected to be down 6% as a result of currency, which creates a 7% headwind at current exchange rates. We clearly expect that slightly lower revenues will be offset by record margin performance. Its operating margin remains solidly on track to exceed 21% for the full year, and it's worth pointing out that in spite of a 6% or $850 million revenue decline, we're on track to set a new record for operating income dollars this year. In terms of capital allocation, we continue to invest aggressively for growth, pay an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, and as I said earlier, we expect to invest approximately $2 billion in share repurchases with $1.8 billion completed to-date.","Turning to the third quarter, we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.32 to $1.40, up 6% in the midpoint with $0.11 of negative impact from currency assuming current exchange rates. We expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 1% and we should achieve record operating margin of approximately 22% as Enterprise Initiatives deliver 100 basis points of margin expansion.","So that summarizes the quarter and our guidance for the balance of the year. As you can see, the operating teams continue to execute well in a challenging external operating environment. And we remain solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2015 and 2017 performance goals as we continue to focus on and invest in our strategy to accelerate organic revenue growth across the company.","So with that, let me turn it back over to Aaron.","Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Michael. We'll now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief so as to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question. And remember one question, one follow-up question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your lines are open.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Can I start with PLS? How, Scott and Michael, do you have confidence that PLS is working and that there is going to \u2013 this is basically going to incite underlying growth, call it starting \u2013 or improved underlying growth starting in 2016? I mean, plus it's a bit of a black box, so could you just tell us, because obviously growth is probably investors' number one concern with you right now, not Enterprise Initiatives that are clearly working. So how does the PLS \u2013 how do you have the confidence PLS as it dissipates will incite better underlying growth?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, absolutely the elimination of the negative is the obvious first part of that, right. So the whole point of PLS is really around the idea of simplification, and embedded in 80\/20 is a real strong discipline around focusing on the relative handful of product lines and customers that really can drive growth. So the PLS that we're doing now is a collection of 15 years of aggressive acquisition. So we're going through now \u2013 50 to 60 deals a year, we're going through now and really simplifying our businesses, consolidating our focus on our best growth opportunities from a product line in an end market and customer standpoint. It's not something that's new to the company but certainly it's something that's new in terms of being done at this level across the company all at once.","The end result is that we eliminate the distractions both from the standpoint of operational distraction from the standpoint of distraction to the focus of our sales teams, marketing teams. So the growth agenda and the growth focus becomes very clear. PLS by itself doesn't create growth, but what it does is create a high degree of focus on the best growth opportunities we have, and we still then have to execute on that. But the elimination of that complexity, we have a lot of conviction about the fact that that's a really important step in this process.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Would you expect, Scott, some sort of a multiplier effect? So in other words, if it's dragging by one, you don't simply add one to future growth. The focus allows you to get a little bit better? I'm not trying to be leading, I am just...","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no. Absolutely. We expect to accelerate organic. We expect to be an above-market grower by 200 basis points across the company. And that's because we are focusing the company on highly differentiated positions in end markets that fundamentally have reasonable growth prospects, but we expect to be able to outperform market level growth because we are focused on driving highly differentiated solutions to end customers that have complex and sophisticated business problems.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is PLS \u2013 yeah, I was going to ask, is PLS dragging cash flow? Because you mentioned you expect cash to accelerate, I guess, based on it driving toward 100%, if not higher, for the back half. Is it dragging cash, I think, at 80% net income conversion this quarter?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no. No, PLS doesn't create a drag on cash flow. I'd say actually quite the opposite over time. The 80% conversion is in line with our typical run rate for the first half. Same as we did last year in the first half of the year. And so we would expect it to accelerate here in the back half and we're confident that we'll be at or above our 100% target for the year.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just last, China auto, 8% is probably a relief for a lot of folks, but the question is with production rates expected in that country to come down, how are you thinking about your trends juxtaposed against your performance penetration, but then obviously slowing production rates in that market?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're talking about just auto, John, or the whole company?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, just auto in China.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the auto China business, it's largely a penetration story. I think we are at the early stages of sort of moving from the global OEMs \u2013 not moving from but supplementing a very strong position with global OEMs in China with an accelerating level of penetration for the sort of major domestic players over there. So I think there's plenty of runway for us. The build rates or the production rates are certainly going to have some impact overall, but we're still running high-single digits there in a market that last quarter, I think, was \u2013 the build rate was up a couple of percent. So I don't think \u2013 the macro in China is going to have some relative effect, but I don't think it's going to make it impact our overall ability to grow there over the next multiple years.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, then second half, is this going to be one for one? So for instance, if builds in China go from plus two to minus five, would that subtract seven points from your trend or do you think you do a little better or is it too granular?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's a little granular. I would say we're running 6 percentage points ahead of market, so figure five to six, I think, would be a good target.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I know the focus is shifting to growth, but let's talk about the margins for a second because they were still really good in basically a no-growth environment. The Enterprise Initiatives are coming through. I'm just curious, as the year progresses, how are you guys thinking about price\/cost? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about that negative 40 basis point impact you saw in the other line item? Is that mostly driven by mix this quarter?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So let's start with the 40 basis points of other negative impact on margins. And it's very simply \u2013 it was a project that we completed in Specialty Products last year that didn't repeat in this quarter. So that is a...","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is a high margin project.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That didn't repeat on a year-over-year basis, and so you'd expect that drag to go away for the balance of the year. For the balance of the year, you would also expect it align with our guidance that our Enterprise Initiatives continue to generate 100 basis points of margin expansion. We have a lot of confidence around that number just given the projects underlying that in terms of our sourcing efforts and our business structure simplification projects. Price\/cost was favorable again this quarter at 20 basis points, and we expect that to remain at 20 basis points favorability here in the second half of the year. We have not seen any change in the dynamics around our ability to get price.","As you know, one of the byproducts of product line simplification is that your portfolio is much more differentiated, and so if anything we should have the ability to maintain our pricing if not do a little bit better. And on the cost side, I'd say on the question we talked about on the last call around material deflation as a result of crude oil and other commodities, we are still working on that. We have not seen it in the numbers yet. I think it would be reasonable to assume that we'll get some favorability in the second half, but again we're not counting on it. So those are soon to call out here and certainly not in our planning assumptions for the second half.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would just add to that, we've got \u2013 given what we have already talked about in terms of our 2017 margin target, we've got 100 basis points of margin improvement from initiatives for another two years after this one, 100 basis points a year.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, that's helpful.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not just the next two quarters in other words.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. No, that's helpful. I guess maybe my one follow-up and shifting gears back into the growth side and the CapEx side, can you maybe provide a little bit of color on both Welding and Test & Measurement, and specifically what's happening within oil and gas? I think your expectations last quarter were for oil and gas to be down $30 million (26:44). And then within Test & Measurement, I know it's only about $100 million of that business, but that market was also down significantly this quarter. So any color on the oil and gas and non-oil and gas trends within those two segments would be helpful.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think from an oil and gas perspective, I think the first quarter run rates held up. They probably flipped around the percentages maybe a little bit just based on whatever happened last year in terms of seasonality, so no real uptick or further deceleration either way in the oil and gas side. I think on the Welding side, what we saw in the second quarter that we didn't see as much in the first quarter is the softness in Welding expanding beyond oil and gas, and Michael talked about it in his comments that the core industrial equipment business was down 4%, 5% I think in the quarter. And even the commercial business, that has been, which is the lighter duty part of the Welding capital equipment sector, which has been a little bit more robust, was down I think 1% or 2% in the quarter. So beyond oil and gas, at least in terms of the second quarter, the year-on-year trends got incrementally negative.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. And then on Test & Measurement?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the core business there just continues to be choppy. I think the year-on-year comps got a little worse. The non-oil and gas related end markets for our Test & Measurement equipment business in terms of second quarter were down probably mid-single-digit year-on-year. And again, no real changes in terms of run rate or demand patterns there, but more of the same.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Things are not getting better yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Question on the $0.05 increase to the 2015 guidance, could you help us a little bit more with the components that drove that? The organic growth went down a little bit, but everything else on slide 11 stayed reasonably constant with the equivalent slide in the Q1 presentation.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so Andy \u2013 so you're right. I mean the revenue assumption is a little bit lower for the back half of the year, but that's offset by the stronger margin performance in the back half. The $0.05 really is the $0.04 of beat in the quarter here, which is a combination of primarily currency favorability relative to our guidance and slightly better margins and so we're carrying that forward. And then as we sit here today, relative to the currency planning assumption we had in April, we have a little bit of favorability. So those things together make up the $0.05 that we raised the guidance for the year.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Michael. And then if I look at \u2013 and I'm going to get a little picky here, but if I look at Auto OEM and Food Equipment, the operating margin was still really strong, but it softened a little bit in Q2 versus Q1. Is that a function of the shift to the organic growth acceleration or were there other impacts that caused around a 50 basis point, 60 basis point compression in the quarter?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, Andy (30:24). There's really nothing unusual in terms of the margins. I mean, it can fluctuate a little bit quarter-by-quarter, but I just...","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Based on mix shifts.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I just look at the year-over-year performance. I mean, Food 250 basis points. And if you look at the schedule in the appendix, you'll see that was on higher restructuring, so it's actually over 300 basis points excluding that. And then Automotive at 24.5% is still very strong performance. I think if you look at our peers in that space, that's approximately 3x what everybody else does in that space. So I appreciate you being a little picky here, but I really don't \u2013 I don't want to be defensive, but I think we feel very good about the progress on margins.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Raso with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Hi. Good morning. A pretty straightforward question. I'm just curious how July has started organically versus your third quarter guidance and, for that matter, even sort of the implied fourth quarter? The base growth a year ago accelerated a little bit 3Q, 4Q from what you had in 2Q?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, that's right. The comps are little tougher here, David, in the back half, so third quarter of last year, I think, was up 3.5% organically. As an aside, EPS was up 40% last year. So in July, it's in line with the guidance for the quarter. We said up in that 0% to 1% range, and that's kind of what we're seeing so far. Typically, sequentially the business in total is flat from Q2 to Q3. Auto typically is down a little bit, offset by some of the other businesses. But really nothing unusual as we go into the back half of the year.","I'd say the things we just talked about, Scott talked about Welding and Test & Measurement certainly not improving and some tough comps particularly on the equipment side in those businesses. We talked about automotive China. We'll see how that plays out in terms of auto builds, but we'll outperform that market substantially, and everything else is kind of in line with what we've seen so far. And I think, David, just to add on, if you look at our guidance for the year, and the EPS of the first half of the year represents 49% of the total year and the second half is 51%, and so we're exactly in line with where we performed historically and we're not counting on an acceleration or things getting a lot better here in the second half of the year.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Yeah, I'm not trying to nickel and dime it, but as you said, usually 2Q, 3Q are roughly similar. Things don't seem to be accelerating. But you were willing to put a nickel to actually $0.06 on the midpoint increase into your guidance 2Q to 3Q, which \u2013 I mean, I'll take it, but I was a little surprised that you were willing to guide 3Q where you did, given the trends. There must be some underlying confidence on the margins...","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","...maybe July was stronger than we thought, but now it sounds like you're going to have to get that nickel sequentially $0.06 to the midpoint of the guidance really from margins. And maybe if you can help us maybe the share count at the end of the quarter, anything to...?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The share count is 368 million. And you're right. The improvement from Q2 to Q3 is all operating margin performance. So like I said, Q3 should be another record for the company at approximately 22%, and we just did 21.3%. And so on the same revenues, I think if you do the math, you'll see that it's a very reasonable assumption.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joel Tiss with BMO. Sir, your line is now open.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. How's it going, guys?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good, Joel.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is there a less upward margin pressure as the PLS starts to slow down a little bit in 2016?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Less upward margin pressure? Can you clarify that, Joel?","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You're eliminating fewer and fewer negatives, so there's \u2013 it seems logical that there would be a little bit less buoyancy in the margin improvement. Or is that getting so small that it doesn't matter anymore?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're talking about a relatively immaterial amount of revenue, so I don't \u2013 the addition by subtraction is not a significant driver of the margin improvement. There're certainly some underlying costs that comes out from an operating perspective as we take the complexity out of a lot of relatively small volume SKUs. That's a normal part of our 80\/20 process. So I don't think there's a whole lot of delta in terms of margin momentum around the sort of revenue impact the PLS starting to dissipate here.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And I just wondered, Scott, if you could give us a little bit more color on a couple of the drivers of the organic growth. Some new product introductions and some of the capacity that you added, just some kind of real live examples to give us a little bit better flavor.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think you're seeing it in places like Food Equipment from an innovation perspective, Automotive OEM. I mean we've talked about it before as these businesses as we have gone through this repositioning around our strategy, our seven businesses were all in a different starting point. The Auto OEM business was the most ready, sort of move through the process of streamlining their structure, developing a sourcing capability, simplifying their product offerings, and you're seeing coming out the other side in their performance. An example of what we think \u2013 to certainly higher or lower percentages overall, the way that we're ultimately positioning the entire company to operate.","So in terms of the investments there, we're investing heavily in R&D, we're investing heavily in capacity. This is a business growing high-single digits, so we are investing ahead. It's also a business where we have a three-year out time horizon, so we have a pretty good runway there. So we are investing and supporting that growth rate in terms of capital equipment and what are the next innovation programs beyond the current three-year horizon.","Food Equipment is another one that's now starting to come out the other side, 9% equipment growth in North America in the quarter. Service business up mid-single digits worldwide and that's being driven by both focus \u2013 the ability to focus on their best, most competitive positions, most compelling growth opportunities and the amount of investing they're now positioned to support and execute on those growth opportunities.","Construction started to come out the other side at least as it relates to North America, so there's no secret in terms of what we're doing here other than we've got some \u2013 we're in some really good industries. We're in product offerings in those industries that are highly differentiated that solve real meaningful problems for customers and we expect the acceleration to come from an ability to really focus on fully leveraging those opportunities, and that focus increases as we're having to spend less time inside those businesses doing things like PLS, developing sourcing, divesting businesses, et cetera. So that's really the glide path we're on.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then just, Mike, real fast, I don't know if you answered why the free cash flow was down $100 million in the quarter, and if you could just give us an update on the timing of reducing debt as the share repurchase starts to get toward the end?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think if you look at Q1, Q2 last year cash flow and this year, there were some movements between Q1 and Q2 related to the IPG divestiture and some of the tax payments associated with that. If you normalize for that, like I said, for the first half of the year, this year we converted 80% of the income to cash, exactly the same number as what we did last year. And so it's really...","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we have done for the last (38:58)","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, that's kind of our historical run rate. And then we ramp up from here. And so like I said, we all expect and you should expect us to meet or exceed the 100% target for the year. So nothing unusual really there. In terms of \u2013 so you asked reducing the overall debt, I mean we don't have any plans to change our current target leverage ratio. We're in that 2.2 times, 2.3 times range. That's, for us, the optimal structure at this point given how much cash this business model generates, how much cash we have on hand, net leverage is about 1.5 times. That is what really supports the overall Enterprise Strategy here from a capital allocation standpoint. So there are no plans to materially change our overall debt or leverage ratio target in the near term.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks guys.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just one more comment on the free cash flow. Our second and third quarters going back for a long, long time are higher overall revenue quarters than Qs one and four. So from the standpoint of the seasonal free cash flow, in the second quarter, we're funding additional working capital around those higher elevated seasonal sales to support Q2 and Q3. And then in Q1 and Q4, those numbers come back down. So we always are sort of negative to net income from a free cash flow standpoint in the first half of the year and positive in the second half of the year. And it's just the incremental delta on receivable and inventories to support the seasonal fluctuations in sales.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I think, Michael, you mentioned 3Q, the pickup in the midpoint is driven by the margin. And we don't have a huge amount of seasonal history with this new portfolio, so I'm wondering is that pickup driven by base cost reduction, i.e., initiatives? So is there some mix factor at play here?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. There's probably a little bit of mix. We'll see how it plays out in the quarter. The bulk of the improvement here is driven again by the Enterprise Initiatives. So we will get 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and then sequentially, like I said, revenues are about the same. Year-over-year, we expect revenues to be flat to 1%. And so again, the key driver here is really operating margins in the 22% range. And you know this, Nigel. If you go back historically, same as last year and the years before, the third quarter is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating margin.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, it's a bit of a different mix too to a lot of (42:02) companies because of the shutdowns in the summer period tend to cause a little bit of operating deleverage. But I noticed last year we had the same dynamic. So I'm wondering with the new portfolio whether there's mix play. But it sounds like there's a bit of mix and a bit of operating cost reduction. And then the second is just what struck me was the geographic trends in international markets, Europe up 2% and Asia-Pac down 3%. And what really struck me was the Welding performance in EMEA, up 5%. So I'm wondering can you maybe just give a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing in Welding Europe and how sustainable you think that is?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so I think Europe, we've talked about before, really for us as a company stabilized back in 2013, and we're quite encouraged by what we've seen and the 2% growth in the region. I think on the Welding side, this was a good quarter in Europe, which was really driven by a one-time order. We hope it's not one-time, but that's what we're hearing. So I wouldn't read too much into that in Europe. It wasn't a specific customer or specific country, so.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Well, thanks for the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So halfway through the Enterprise Strategy and, Scott, I recall that the big emphasis was there's going to be this pivot from two-thirds M&A and one-third organic to reverse that to two-thirds organic, one-third M&A. And my question is you really haven't seen M&A getting restarted, and Michael's comments on capital allocation, not one mention of M&A. And so at what point do you start to restart that M&A engine? Or do you want to recast a different percent of organic versus M&A?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't think \u2013 I think our intentions around this are pretty clear. We talked about it at the Investor Meeting in December in terms of first of all strategically where do we see M&A fitting in terms of the overall company's strategy. The simplified version of that is we would love to bolt great assets onto these seven great businesses that we have. The way I would describe it is we would be delighted to add a great company right now, and that's not new news. That's been true throughout. What I would say the difference is, is we're probably not as actively out in the prospecting mode around the opportunities to do that as we will be, as we get further down the Enterprise Strategy. But from the standpoint of, would we have appetite for a really good bolt-on acquisition tomorrow if we had one become available to us, absolutely we would. But the criteria is pretty strict, and it's pretty clear internally, what fits and what doesn't.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I would just add, Deane, if you look at the transactions that have taken place in our space over the last couple of years, we've got a chance to see them all, and we don't feel like we've missed anything. And as Scott said, given the right set of circumstances, we'd love to bolt something on to one of our seven segments.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So that two-thirds, one-third is still a healthy target?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Good. And then second question would be maybe if you could provide some comments and specifics around that North American Construction number of 15%. A lot of people have been hoping, wishing that the non-res would start gaining traction. So how much of that is on the non-res side, how much is renovation, housing, and so forth? And what's the outlook?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so the big improvement, Deane, in the quarter was really on the renovation\/remodeling side up \u2013 that drove the bulk of the increase, up 25%, that's what led to North America being up 15%. We did see some slight improvement in residential, up mid-single-digits. Last quarter, we talked about that part of the business being flat. And commercial was about the same, so up low-single-digits in commercial construction. Really the main driver renovation and remodeling, and we feel good about the current trends in the business.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Steven Fisher with UBS. Sir, your line is now open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","This may just be rounding small numbers, but if I assume the midpoint of organic growth for Q3, it looks like you're anticipating a bit of acceleration in growth in Q4. Is that the way you're thinking about it? And if so, where might that acceleration come from?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's really back, Steve, to the comps. And so Q3 last year was up 3.5%. Q4 was up a little less than 2.5%. And so it's really the way we model the guidance here is based on current run rates, adjusted for typical seasonality. And so that's really what's driving. It's not an acceleration in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. It's really the comps year-over-year.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's fine. And then just a follow up on Deane's question on Construction. I know you've been fairly cautious on Construction. Obviously this was your best quarter of growth in a long time. You talked about the North American trends. Is there anything in the business that's making you think just a little more optimistically about the business broadly? And then related to the European construction, you called out some softness in Continental Europe. Was that any particular market, France or Germany or anything else?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so on the latter point in Europe, the U.K. and Scandinavia continue to be very good, and then with some challenges in France and Southern Europe as you would expect. I think we feel very good, not just about the current kind of daily order rates in the business but just look at the margin performance and the improvements since we embarked on the Enterprise Strategy. So think about how much more is flowing through the bottom line, given all the work that's been done on the Enterprise Initiatives. And so I think the team has done a really nice job positioning this business for growth, and right now we're taking advantage of some lift seen (49:05) on the end markets and we feel good about the current trends and we'll see how it plays out.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's feeling a little more like it has some legs than it has in the past, but I say that with a whole bunch of caution. I'm talking about, first of all, just North America, but we've been down this road before a number of times. So I think we'll want to see another quarter or two before we really see it, feel comfortable with the trajectory in terms of underlying end market demand. But it does seem to be a little bit more consistent at least over the next two months or three months than what we've seen historically. So we're hopeful but certainly not ready to call it yet.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Sorry to harp on the Construction again, but just another follow up question because some other companies cited some weakness in the second quarter on the construction equipment side, in particular May, and it could have been energy, it could have been weather. But I guess within your North American Construction, was the strength that you saw in North America consistent throughout the quarter or was it more, I guess, June weighted?","And then I guess my second question is back to sort of capital allocation. I know you've guided for share repurchase for $2 billion in the year, but you bought back $180 million of stock back in the quarter, which is the lowest number we've seen. Given the positive or improving free cash flow generation in the back half of the year and given that there doesn't seem to be a lot on the M&A side, is there upside to the $2 billion in share repurchase if the cash flow generation is there? And if not, what will the cash go towards? Thanks.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so let's start with the first question first. So in the second quarter, same as \u2013 and this is true for the enterprise \u2013 very consistent throughout the quarter by month. June was our best month, but it typically is in the quarter. And so I wouldn't read too much into an acceleration in the quarter because we certainly did not see that. This was out of the gate really good growth on the Construction side as we talked about.","On capital allocation, as you know, we did $1.6 billion in the first quarter. We did $180 million here in the quarter, so we have a commitment to do approximately $2 billion for the year. Feel very good about that, and if the company continues to perform as well as it is and nothing is going to change in terms of our view longer term of what this Enterprise Strategy will do in terms of the overall financial performance of the company. And so given that and given the alternative of letting the cash sit on the balance sheet, we will repurchase shares as an alternative to that.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All righty. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is now open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe you could give us some insight into your forecast for automotive builds by region for the back half?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so we're still in the same kind of low-single-digit type global auto builds. I think there's some seasonality here in the third quarter and some discussion around whether there will be shutdowns or not, but I wouldn't really expect much of a change in the second half versus what we have seen in the first half. So overall kind of in that low-single-digit range, which is good enough for us to grow the business in the high-single digits and in some regions like Europe, if you look at flat auto builds, we are growing the business double digits. So that's kind of what \u2013 more of the same in the back half of the year.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then on the Food Equipment side, maybe some color on the segments, institutional versus fast casual versus other sectors. What are you seeing in the segment?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think institutional, fast casual, which is \u2013 institutional is about 40% of our business. It's still very good. The growth here is not really \u2013 the end markets are not growing at 4%. I mean the outperformance here, I just want to be clear, is really the focus by the team on driving organic growth and it's the new products that are being launched and the Service business side that is performing at a higher level than what we have seen historically. So that's how I would describe it. So that's kind of the landscape there.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just one philosophical question. One of your competitors is very proud of the fact that they have hired a few ITW folks and that they're now going to become an 80\/20 company. Could you just talk a little bit about the barriers to implementing 80\/20? I mean, you are unique and you have been doing this for a long time. How easy or how difficult is it going to be for somebody to replicate 80\/20?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't know what they're going to do. All I can talk about is our company and we have been applying 80\/20 for going back to the mid 1980s. It is something that continually evolves. I'm not sure who you're referring to, but in general, the way we practice it today is pretty unique, and it's very different than we practiced it two years ago even in terms of the way it continues to evolve inside our company. So I guess that's all I can say.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Offline, I'll tell you who it is. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just one quick one. I thought the Welding margin was pretty impressive given the organic growth there, and I guess it sounds like, Scott, you're telling us that Welding isn't showing any signs of recovery. So can we assume that these margins can hold in Welding or was that one sort of special item, I think, Michael might have mentioned, did that have a margin impact?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think one of the things embedded in the 80\/20 process and the way we run the company is we have a very flexible cost structure, and I think \u2013 I appreciate you actually pointing that out, because I think our Welding team has done a terrific job of certainly continuing to invest in their long-term growth potential while at the same time on a tactical basis doing some really nice work, minimizing the overall earnings and margin impact on this contraction in sales that they've been seeing over the last couple of quarters. So nothing special about it other than it is core to how we run the railroad here.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Sir, your line is now open.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Most of the questions obviously have been asked at this point. Can we just step back a moment and see whether you have seen any noticeable change either in segments or regionally that you could identify for the second half of the year lookout (56:56)? I mean, you're pretty much saying everything will continue second half, first half, but is there anything noticeable? Second part to that, I'm sure this is probably because you're not big in Latin America, can you talk about your exposure there and what's going on down in that part of the world, which is (57:11)?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we didn't call out Latin America specifically this time. It's less than 3% of our sales. It's down about high-single digits, 9%. And then most of that is driven by as you might imagine the Welding in the oil and gas business in that area. In terms of the second half of the year, anything unusual by segment or geography, I can't really think of anything to be honest with you. I think the second half will look to some extent similar to the first half in terms of top-line growth and then continued progression on the margin front and strong cash flows. And I can't really think of anything that we're different.","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I was just going to add to that, just to reinforce what you said earlier and what we've talked about along is, we're not in the business of trying to forecast economically. So our forecast is basically taking the current run rate. It doesn't mean we're being pessimistic or optimistic. We'd love for things to get better. And when they do, we're in a position to react, but ultimately we have no crystal ball out there embedded in any of our numbers expecting things to go one way or the other. That doesn't mean that we have a particular view on that. It just means that the way we operate the company that there's really no advantage for us doing that.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And as far as this whole chaos in Greece and what's happening on, you haven't seen any real dramatic effect on business conditions across the enterprise for you guys?","Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I think we continue \u2013 look at the performance of the company in Europe, and I think that answers the question. Still very good, so.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President, Investor Relations","And I think that takes us basically to the top of the hour. So that concludes our call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Larsen","Okay, thank you Bob. Good morning and welcome to ITW's second quarter 2017 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and update you on our 2017 earnings forecast.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the third quarter and full-year 2017 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the Company's 2016 Form 10-K for more detail, but important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. And while we use very few non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Santi","Thanks Michael and good morning. Overall, ITW continued to execute well in the second quarter as we delivered strong results and established several new all-time performance records for the company. Earnings per share of $1.69 was up 16% year-on-year, 14% if you exclude the $0.03 of share benefit from a legal settlement that we recognized in the quarter. Operating income of $874 million was up 10% year-on-year, was the highest quarterly operating income in the company's history. Q2 operating margin of 24.3% was also an all-time record for the company and was up 120 basis points, with enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis points of improvement. ","After-tax return on invested capital improved 190 basis points to 24.8%. We are continuing to make good progress our pivotal organic growth. Year-to-date, our organic growth rate is up 3%, is up almost 2 full percentage points versus last year reflecting both improving demand in our industrial facing businesses, particularly Welding and Test & Measurement, and Electronics and continued progress on organic growth framework initiatives across all seven of our segments. Based on our Q2 and a relatively stable near-term end market demand environment, we're increasing our full-year EPS guidance by $0.12 at the midpoint. ","Overall, we continue to make good progress on our path to ITW\u2019s full potential and the company is well positioned to deliver continued strong performance in the second half and beyond.","With that I'll turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q2 results and updated 2017 forecast. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Scott. So starting with Slide 3, GAAP EPS increased 16% to $1.69. Total revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 4.9%, with organic growth of 2.6%. Organic growth was positive in all major geographies with North America up 1.4% and international up 4.2%, driven primarily by Europe, which was up 3.4% and China which was up 13.3%. Six of our seven segments had positive organic growth. It was great to see welding turn positive, up 3% for the first time since 2014. ","Sequentially, from Q1 to Q2, organic revenues accelerated 2.8%. Ahead of our historical run rate as welding, test and measurement electronics, and specialty products all exceeded their Q1 run rate. We increased operating margin 120 basis points over last year, which was driven primarily by continued progress on our enterprise strategy initiatives and volume leverage. Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of margin expansion. And five of seven segments increased operating margin.","Operating income grew 10% to 874 million, making this quarter the most profitable quarter in the company's history. As Scott mentioned, we recorded an EPS benefit of $0.03 per share related to confidential legal settlement. Excluding this item, second quarter earnings were a $1.66 per share, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 28.4% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Free cash flow of 502 million adjusted for a discretionary pension contribution of $115 million was 85% of net income, which is in line with typical seasonality. In the quarter, we made the decision to accelerate future pension contributions, with surplus cash, essentially fully funding our US plan and setting the stage for lower pension contributions in the future.","On Slide 4, you can see that we achieved an all-time record for operating margin in the quarter. Once again enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of structural margin improvement. In addition, volume leverage contributed 50 basis points. As expected, price cost was unfavorable due primarily to higher steel costs in two segments; automotive OEM and construction. At current raw material costs and with our 2017 price adjustments, we expect that price cost for the full year will be positive in dollar terms, but slightly unfavorable 20 to 40 basis points to margin percentage. ","The legal settlement that I mentioned a minute ago contributed 40 basis points and EF&C diluted margins by 60 basis points as expected. We added a line to the margin work to point out the timing impact of lower restructuring spend in Q2 that will catch up in the second half and overhead management efficiencies that we\u2019ve planned for the second half that we were able to accelerate into Q2. Combined these two items contributed the balance 40 basis points. In total, margin improved 120 basis points in the quarter","On Slide 5, you can see our strong first half 2017 performance at the enterprise level, with 18% earnings growth and 3% organic growth. We improved our operating margin by 120 basis points to 23.8% and grew operating income by 11% to 1.7 billion. Free cash flow was 946 million adjusted for pension. Overall, strong performance in the first half of 2017 and positive momentum going into the second half. ","Turning to Slide 6, on the left side of the page you can see what Scott mentioned a minute ago. The solid first half progress on organic growth versus last year as reflected by our first half organic growth rate of 3% as compared to 1.2% in 2016. You can see the results by segment with meaningful improvement in end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement, Electronics segments, continued strong above market organic growth from our Automotive OEM segment and continued progress on our pivotal growth efforts across all seven of our segments.","We also laid out the progress on margins with six of seven segments expanding margins on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the 270 basis points of dilution from the EF&C acquisition, automotive OEM margins would be up 190 basis points to 26% and all seven segments which show margin improvement. I\u2019ll now discuss the segment results in a little more detail starting with automotive OEM, which delivered another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 4%, more than 400 basis points above global car builds. ","In North America, the business was flat as auto builds declined 3% overall, with builds down 6% for the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content. Outside North America, growth continued to be very strong, with Europe up 7% with builds down 3% and China was up 17%, all significantly above market as we continue to increase our content per vehicle, particularly with domestic OEMs.","As we have discussed since December last year, IHS is forecasting a decline in domestic auto builds in the second half of 6% in Q3 and moderating to 2% in Q4. Our full-year guidance incorporates this IHS forecast as it currently stands, which results in full-year organic growth from automotive OEM business of approximately 3%. Operating margin was 22.3%, lower than last year due to EF&C. ","Turning to Slide 7, Food Equipment was up 1% organically. North America was down 1% against a challenging comparison versus the prior. North America equipment was down 2% and service was up 1%. Internationally, equipment was up 3% and service was also up 1%. Operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4% due to enterprise initiatives. We had another solid quarter in test and measurement and electronics with organic growth of 4%.","Test & Measurement grew organic revenue by 6% with continued solid demand in semiconductor related end markets. In our Instron business, where demand is tied more closely to business investment, organic growth was up 4%, which is a good sign for the second half. Electronics was up 3%. Operating margin improved 330 basis points to 21.9%, driven by enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. As a reminder the 21.9% includes 320 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition related intangible assets. ","Turning to Slide 8, demand in welding continues to improve as organic growth was up 3% in Q2. Excluding normal seasonality, demand improved 1.5% sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and year-over-year equipment was up 7% and consumables were down slightly 2%. By geography, North America which is approximately 80% of our business, up 5%, driven by solid growth in both our industrial and commercial equipment businesses. Our commercial equipment business which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication, farm and ranch customers was up 5% year on year in Q2. And it was very encouraging to see that our industrial equipment business which sells primarily into manufacturing including automotive and heavy equipment was also up 5% in the quarter.","Operating margin performance was very strong at 27.2%, driven by enterprise initiatives and lower restructuring. Polymers & fluids revenue declined 1% organically, with automotive aftermarket down 2%, fluids which primarily sells highly engineered lubricants and cleaners into industrial and commercial end markets was up 1%. And Polymers which primarily sells engineered adhesives and sealants for industrial MRO and OEM applications was down 1%. ","Operating margin improved 50 basis points to 21.4%, which includes 400 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets. In Slide 9, construction products organic revenue was up 2%, demand in North America was solid with organic growth of 3%, both commercial and residential were up 3%. Europe was flat and Asia Pacific was up 1%. Operating margin was 24% down slightly due to headwind on price cost driven by the price of steel.","Finally, in specialty products, organic revenue was up 4% with continued strong above market organic growth of 5% in our consumer packaging businesses. Operating margin was the highest in the company at 28.3%, an increase of 230 basis points due to volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Turning to Slide 10 and our updated guidance for 2017. As a result of our strong Q2 results and based on current foreign exchange rates, we\u2019re raising our full-year earnings guidance by $0.12 to a new EPS range of $6.32 to $6.52. And the increase reflects the $0.09 beat [ph] from Q2 and $0.03 from favorable foreign exchange rates. ","Also, at current levels of demand, we expect organic growth of 2% to 4% for the year. And we're raising our margin expectation to approximately 24%. For the third quarter, EPS guidance is a $1.57 to $1.67 with organic growth of 1% to 3%, which includes the impact I discussed previously of the decline in domestic auto builds. Finally, our third quarter and revised full-year EPS guidance does not include any EPS benefit from the previously disclosed legal settlement beyond the $0.03 per share recorded in the second quarter.","With that Bob, we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","John Inch","Can we start off this line item unallocated in the op margins? I'm trying to remember what is that because it's run rate kind of in the mid 20s down to sort of - it was sort of a source of significant income, why was it almost zero this quarter? Is there any explanation?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So that is the impact of the illegal settlement, which was booked in that line item essentially. So what we do is we allocate our corporate cost to the segments on a percentage of revenue basis and because our corporate costs went down as a result of the legal settlement, we allocated less to the segments this quarter. So that's what you're seeing in that line, John.","John Inch","So was it about 20 [indiscernible] Michael, kind of the run rate that has been? There's nothing else in there, right?","Michael Larsen","No, there's nothing else of significance in there, yes.","John Inch","Food equipment was a little weak and it seemed like - if I go back to my notes, I thought some projects, I realized it was a tough compare, but I thought projects were being - have been deferred from the first quarter into the second quarter. Did those not hit or was there anything else kind of going on in the segment?","Scott Santi","Those did John, that was on the international side and you international up a solid 3% in line with expectations. I think what you saw a little bit in Q2 here was a slowdown on the restaurant side of the business, which is only about 20% of our business, but it was down in the 7% range. Our business as you know is primarily focused on the institutional side and institutional was actually up in that 2% to 3% range in the quarter. And for us, the QSR side was also positive and the retail side. So overall, the slight slowdown that you're seeing here is as a result of the restaurant side. And as we look into the second half here based on the current run rates and backlog in that business, we\u2019ll be back in that 2% to 3% range organic growth in the second half for the business.","John Inch","And then lastly Michael, your auto guidance, you\u2019re still sticking to the 3, so that implies your core growth \u2013 ITW\u2019s core growth is going to go negative in the second half? How would you parse that out sort of between third and fourth quarter?","Michael Larsen","So the decline in automotive OEM, if you look at in the second half is going to be in Q3. So that's when you see the bulk of the decline in North America auto builds down 6% and actually down more than that with the D3s where we have relatively higher content. And then the decline in builds moderates in Q4. And so, if you translate that that's part of what's driving the Q3 versus Q4 organic growth rate for the company. So we\u2019ll be you know we are guiding to 1% to 3% for Q3 and that implies a better organic growth rate than that in the fourth quarter, really primarily driven by the auto builds.","John Inch","Right, which helps to explain why your fourth quarter EPS doesn't decline sequentially as much as it does or as it has historically, is that a fair statement?","Michael Larsen","That is a fair statement.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz. Andy, your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So Michael, this one might be for you. Maybe talking about price versus cost in general, I know you mentioned that you would have 20 to 40 basis points of headwind this year; I think you had talked about 10 to 30 last quarter. It doesn't look like that big a deal on the total impact of ITW, but it lead to a decline as you mentioned in construction products. So as you go forward here, can you pass through more price in that segment to offset rising costs or should we set out flat margin profile for that segment going forward for a while because of price versus cost?","Michael Larsen","Andy, let me just put it in context, I mean, we just reported record operating margins at 24.3%. So price cost was a little bit more of a headwind really as a result of the primarily the price of steel. We have passed on - we\u2019ve made the price adjustments essentially we need to make for 2017 and we're set up for the pressure on price cost to moderate here in the second half of the year and margins would continue to improve from here on the construction side.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And Scott, shifting over to welding, obviously it's continuing to improve. I know in the past we talked about, you know, welding used to be a high-single digit growth business and assuming that this is a relatively traditional recovery, is it fair to say that welding growth could get back here into at least the mid-single digits has it\u2019s been in the past. And do you have any visibility that tells you that we're still on the sort of upward glide. I know you mentioned the better industrial results. So, is that the way to look at it going forward?","Scott Santi","I absolutely believe that the underlying potential is every bit as positive in welding as it has been historically on a go forward basis. We are, you know, Michael talked about it, I think the encouraging thing in Q2 is that we saw the industrial side of that business turn positive in a pretty significant way in Q2. I think it's, you know, we hate to call one quarter trend. So I think we're in the wait and see mode here a little bit, but overall I would say that we are at least hopeful that what we saw in the second quarter will continue and if it does, then we would expect welding to be back at some point here to its traditional place in our portfolio as one of the strongest organic growers in the company.","Operator","Next question is from David Raso of Evercore ISI. David, your lines open.","David Raso","I was curious about the guidance, the organic sales growth guidance. If 3Q does come in at your guidance of positive 2%, to reach the full-year guide it implies the fourth quarter again. It clearly has to reaccelerate close to 4%. Can you explain why do you expect that much of an acceleration in the fourth quarter?","Michael Larsen","I think we\u2019ve just talked about this a couple minutes ago. I mean the key driver here is really if you look at the IHS forecast for the second half, the decline in domestic builds is greater in Q3 than Q4. So that delta is really what's driving the bulk of what you're describing, which is a 1% to 3% organic growth rate expected for Q3 and then implied a higher growth rate than that for Q4. So it's primarily driven by the forecast for auto builds in North America.","David Raso","So for the fourth quarter, are there any other businesses that we should be thoughtful about that you expect an acceleration or is it really that significantly sensitive to the auto swing in 3Q and 4Q year-over-year.","Michael Larsen","All of the other businesses, David, as we usually do is a model based on current run rate adjusted for typical seasonality.","Scott Santi","[indiscernible] industrial.","Michael Larsen","Right, I mean, that\u2019s the other thing. I mean, we are seeing what we just talked about, you know, the industrial businesses; welding, test & measurement, electronics, there is some positive momentum in those businesses. But it is primarily driven\u2026","David Raso","Run rated out from here.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. I mean what we usually do is we take current Q2 run rate and order rate and we run rate amount adjust for seasonality, but there is no assumption of a significant acceleration beyond that built into Q4.","David Raso","But that math is what it is, just taken some of those CapEx businesses, run rates run them out. They do give you a little better organic growth in 4Q then 3Q or recently right, that's the idea of\u2026","Michael Larsen","Yeah.","David Raso","Solely auto, but auto is the main issue. Second question, last question, the gross margin is down year over year; they haven't been down year over year for six years. I wish all my companies could have 42% gross margins, but still to see it down 70 bps year-over-year, was that what you were expecting and is that how we should think of the rest of the year if you can explain that in more detail?","Michael Larsen","Yeah I think price cost was a little more unfavorable than maybe we expected. We've talked about this lag in the past between when you start realizing price increases and when the material costs show up in the income statement. And I think what the timing was off maybe a little bit versus what we expected, but as I also said on price cost, we would expect that to start to moderate that pressure here as we go into the second half. We've made the price adjustments we need to make based on current material cost and if anything some of the pressure we've seen on steel may be easing here in the second half. So we feel fairly confident that we have this one baked in our guidance for the rest of the year.","David Raso","So for the full year, if you think about the growth, the operating margin is up 150 bps. Do you expect any improvement year-over-year in the gross margin or is it more of an SG&A story for this year?","Michael Larsen","It\u2019s both; you will see both, David.","David Raso","So you expect gross margins to be still higher year-over-year, okay. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel, your line is open. * *** 24-48 *** Nigel, your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Couple of quick follow-ups. Just as kind of, just to put final points on the second half auto, it looks from your comments Mike that your [indiscernible] in 3Q and then flat in 4Q. Is that a fair run rate?","Michael Larsen","Yeah. So we -- I\u2019d rather not Nigel -- if I start giving guidance by segment here based on external forecasts, it gets a little tricky, so I'd rather not go down that path, but I think if you model this, you can yourself, based on the data we have provided you, can get pretty close.","Nigel Coe","And then just thinking about welding, obviously welding is coming off the trough, so the recovery is going to be somewhat lumpy, but if you think about the sequentials from what we saw in the first half to the second half, we normally see seasonality down slightly from the first half, but obviously coming off the trough, it could be a little bit better than that. So how do you view the second half versus first half in welding?","Michael Larsen","Yeah. I mean that is correct. I mean, we've modeled the second half based on current run rates, which is the commercial side, up 5; the industrial side, which was the new news, up 5, that business was down 2 in prior quarter; and then oil and gas is still flattish, down actually 1% here in Q2. So we haven't seen a pickup on that side yet.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And just a quick follow-on on the margin bridge, you actually called out overhead efficiency and restructuring of 40 bps, but what exactly is overhead efficiency and how does that differ from the enterprise initiatives?","Michael Larsen","This is more discretionary cost management, so it's your day-to-day blocking and tackling on the cost side.","Operator","Next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","So I guess my first question is on, maybe if you can give a little bit more color on EF&C and the progress that you're making there on the margin side and I guess the reason I'm asking the question is because it seemed to have a little bit more of a negative impact in 2Q to 1Q. So any color around that would be helpful.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. I think we're really pleased with the progress and maybe I\u2019ll let Scott talk to the operational side, but on the financial side, we are ahead of what we had modeled when we made the acquisition by a pretty wide margin at this point. As you may recall, they came in at EBIT margins in that 7% range. A year later, we are already at 11. So I think we\u2019re really pleased with what we're seeing financially and then maybe operationally. Scott -- ","Scott Santi","I would just reiterate what we've talked about in the past, which is it\u2019s a terrific fit with our business I think from a leadership, the quality of the leadership team that we've inherited, we are very pleased. It is all going very well. It does take some time to do what we usually do. So this is a four to five year integration process. And as Michael said, we are ahead of the game, but we are, at this point, four quarters in on a four or five year run. So -- but so far it's been everything we hoped that would be.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That's good to hear. And I guess as my follow-on question, maybe going back to a little bit of discussion here so far an organic growth, so clearly understand the auto build down in the second half of the year and then you guys take a run rate on the rest of your businesses. But to the extent you can provide any color on how business trends went throughout the quarter on the remaining businesses, that would be helpful.","Michael Larsen","Yes, actually we \u2013 typically, we don't see much anything unusual. We actually did see quite an improvement in the month of June. So we feel really good about the momentum going into the third quarter here.","Joe Ritchie","Was it anywhere specifically Michael?","Michael Larsen","It was actually broad based and the international side continues to be strong. And then in North America, in the month of June, now, it's one month, so I wouldn't read too much into it, but really broad based, a meaningful organic growth rate in the mid-single digits, maybe a little higher than that.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Ann, your line is open.","Ann Duignan","If we could just focus on foodservice again, just given all the headwinds that are facing the restaurants in this environment, are you seeing any increase in competition for your institutional business, I mean, you've always had a strength in that segment, but I'm just curious if restaurant is under pressure, are the competitors refocusing their efforts on institutional, if you could just give us some color there would be great.","Michael Larsen","Ann, this is Michael. We haven't seen any change in the competitive dynamics on the institutional side. As you pointed out, we have a really strong position there that's been our focus for a long time and we were pleased to see the business up in a year-over-year basis, again in Q2 and feel very good about our competitive position.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And then as my follow up, could you just talk about share repurchase and what your ending share count was on a diluted basis at the end of quarter? Thanks.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. I think we ended up at 347 and so we are executing the program we laid out back in December, which is $1 billion for the year. $250 million per quarter is the plan and that is the plan for the back half here in Q3 and Q4. I will point out that we have a board meeting coming up where we will, as we typically do, discuss capital allocation and surplus capital deployment specifically and after that meeting, here in a couple of weeks, we\u2019ll provide an update, not just into the dividend, but also any potential further share repurchases for the year.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And any update on acquisition pipeline.","Michael Larsen","Not much of an update here, Ann. We\u2019re not necessarily a great proxy for what's going on in the broader M&A market. I mean, we're really focused on executing this enterprise strategy and deliver the types of results that you've seen from us over the last four years. So that's our primary focus right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Andy, your line is open.","Andy Casey","A lot obviously has been covered already, a couple of detailed points on total revenue, you raised it a little bit. It looks like it's based primarily on currency. What sort of translation rates are you building in there specifically for the euro?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So currency was still a headwind in Q2 and what we, as we always do, Andy, we're modeling based on current rates. So I think if you look today, it\u2019s about 1.17 for the euro. Last year, I think we were 1.12 average. That dealt, the $0.05 just as a rule of thumb drives $0.05 of EPS for the full year. And so in the second half, that\u2019s the $0.03 of EPS favorability versus guidance. But it's nice to see that if rates stay where they are, we're not going to be talking about headwind on currency, which it's been a while since we're able to say that.","Andy Casey","Sure. That it good news. Second one, when you look across your businesses and including the comment you made to an earlier question about June seeing disproportionate strength relative to the rest of the quarter, did that drive any incremental backlog growth at the end of the quarter that you will realize in the second half.","Michael Larsen","Andy, most of our business is really booking and ship -- I mean we get the order today, we ship tomorrow and replenish the inventory the day after. So we tend to be fairly short cycle and so we've not seen a significant change in backlog. And as I say, we\u2019re not really a backlog driven company. ","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Steven Fisher","You guys have a few businesses that have margins that are notably below the rest of the company at this point and looking at test and measurement, autos, polymers and fluid, I know you have had obviously in test and measurement, a pretty good year-over-year improvement, which is impressive, but how focused are you on bringing those segments up to the company average or margin improvement results come more so from the other businesses.","Michael Larsen","The ones that stick out and if you go to the, there's a schedule in the 8-K, attached to the press release that actually lays out the impact that I talked about on the call, I talk about every call of the amortization of the intangibles related to acquisitions and due to the more recent acquisitions in test and measurement, electronics and in polymers and fluids, that\u2019s where you see the bulk of the impact. So you really, on an apples-to-apples basis, need to add back this quarter 320 basis points in test and measurement, 400 basis points in polymers and fluids and really 150 basis points, if you look at it at the enterprise level and just as an aside, if you and we've done this for you on that same schedule, if you translate that into an EPS impact, it's about $0.10 a quarter. ","So $0.40 of non-cash expense, $0.40 of EPS on an annual basis. We are focused on improving margins in all of our businesses and I think what's really encouraging is you're seeing our businesses there are clustered in a tight range in the mid-20s operating margin and I think that really is a result of our businesses leveraging this really unique business model with a very high level of efficiency. And so what we have today in our view is a really highly diversified high quality portfolio with no weak links anywhere. These are all, if you compare our operating margins here to peers, on average, they are 500 basis points better than -- higher than their peers and in some cases, significantly more than that. So I hope that answers your question.","Steven Fisher","And then why are the consumables or welding, why is that declining, is that just lagging the equipment declines we saw over the last couple of years and if so, if the equipment is turned around, how quickly could the consumables turn around and what the underlying would drive it to become positive that\u2019s not already driving it with the equipment sales.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. I mean, first of all, it's a fairly small part of our business, 20% of our revenues. We\u2019re focused, as you know, primarily on the -- of our businesses on the equipment side. Consumables were down slightly in the current quarter and it's really tied back to the international side, which is primarily oil and gas. And so as the oil and gas cycle starts to make its way into the welding consumable side, we should see an improvement on the consumable side as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mig Dobre of Baird. Mig, your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Can we talk a little bit about any changes, if there are any, in your view vis-\u00e0-vis longer term capital deployment, how you're thinking about M&A, any areas where you'd like to add to the portfolio, any updated thoughts here would be helpful.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. Mig, I mean, at this point, nothing has really changed. I think we've been very consistent in terms of our ability to generate strong cash flow, maintain a strong balance sheet and allocate our capital or our shareholders capital with very high level of discipline and so our number one priority is invest in our businesses and to drive organic growth and productivity. That's our number one priority. That only consumes, in our very asset light business model, about 25% of our operating cash flows. ","The second priority is the dividend. And so as you\u2019ve seen, we've been leaning into the dividend with a meaningful increase last year, I just talked about we have a meeting coming up in August here. We allocate about 25% to 30% of our operating cash flow to a dividend that has been growing slightly faster than earnings certainly last year. And then that leaves a fairly sizable portion for external investments, some combination of acquisitions and we\u2019ve talked about the criteria that we're looking for there from a strategic and from an 80-20 improvement standpoint. ","We also talked about that not being really the primary focus for us right now and then any remaining surplus capital, we've returned to shareholders through the share repurchase program and so $1 billion this year that we're executing is really our estimate of surplus cash available in North America. So that's a rebound line of our capital allocation strategy and Mig, just given the performance of the company and our strong position here, we haven't changed anything.","Mig Dobre","I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, if there's any way that we can understand as to whether or not you\u2019re, call it, more active now when evaluating potential acquisitions than you were say six or twelve months ago.","Michael Larsen","No, not really, Mig. We're really focused on executing the current enterprise strategy and continue to make progress on our pivot to organic growth. I think we\u2019re really encouraged by 3% organic growth in the first half, almost two full percentage points better than all of last year and last year was another significant improvement over the year before that. And so that\u2019s the type of momentum that we're trying to generate here really with a laser focus on getting the organic growth rate going.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Sir, your line is open.","Nathan Jones","Starting off here in test and measurement and electronics, obviously, very good margin performance there. It looks like record quarterly margins. Was there anything in terms of mix that influenced that or are we just looking at the enterprise strategy taking hold there and some leverage on volume and how should we think about those margins going forward.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. I mean that's -- you got it. It's exactly what you described, it\u2019s over 300 basis points of enterprise initiative impact and volume leverage. So back to -- you see what happens in these segments, you get a little bit of organic growth to volume leverage and the earnings growth we're able to drive with that is really significant, which is back to again why we're so focused on getting the organic growth rate going. So we would expect the test and measurement business to continue to improve from here.","Nathan Jones","Okay. And then just a question more broadly on the industrial operating businesses. I would assume over the last two or three years that you've probably seen some demand related pricing pressure in those businesses. You're now talking about those businesses improving. How are thinking about your ability to potentially raise real pricing more than just to cover raw materials as we go forward and see industrial, the industrial economy recovering.","Scott Santi","Yeah. I mean Nathan, I appreciate the question. That's not really how we think about it. I mean, we price for value, as we continue to innovate and deliver value to customers, that's how we get price. We\u2019re not, in terms of the price cost equation, we are just trying to cover our increases on the raw materials side. The margin performance by ITW continues to be driven by the enterprise initiatives primarily and then the volume leverage that you're seeing. So those are the key drivers of margin expansion at ITW, not the price cost equation.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Ma\u2019am, your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Two questions. One on polymers and fluids, I know, the business declined organically in a quarter and I guess the comps were a little tougher, but can you talk about the main drivers, how much of that was auto and what your exposure is there? And then my second question, just broadly on China, you continue to see pretty good growth there. I know a lot of its driven by the auto business, but just sustainability of China growth in the second half of the year across your different segments. Thanks.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. So polymers and fluids, as you point out, is really more of a comp issue in the automotive aftermarket business. We launched, the business launched a new product last year and typically, when we do that, you see a ramp up in the quarter that didn't repeat this year. So the only other thing I can point to is really on the polymers side is in selling into the wind industry, there's a little bit of a decline in that part of the business, but overall, stable. ","And I would just point out that even though as you saw revenues were down slightly, margins continued to improve in that business, which is certainly encouraging. In terms of China, the growth continues to be really strong and it's not just the automotive business, it's really across the board. Excluding automotive, China was up 11% this quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, up 16% and it's really broad based. So we feel really good about our position in China and we feel good about our ability to continue to perform at a high level in the second half.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Sir, your line is open.","Walter Liptak","Wanted to ask about just kind of the overall margin profile for the company. It\u2019s a great performance this quarter. I think in the past, you talked about getting to 25% overall and I think that was a 2018 number. And I just wondered if volume, the organic growth continues to come back, are we thinking about the wrong way, if we're thinking mid-20s is where the operating margin improvement ends, could you get to 28%, 30% with operating leverage coming through?","Michael Larsen","It's a good question, Walt. I mean how I would think about it is for the year, we expect to be at 24%. We have a clear line of sight to another 100 basis points of margin expansion from enterprise initiatives, obviously for the second half of \u201917 and also for \u201918. So those -- that alone takes us to that 25% range. And then, you have to model what you think the organic growth rate is going to be for the company. ","And historically, our incremental margins on organic growth have been in that 30% to 35% range, maybe at the higher end of that range recently. And so theoretically, that's where we would be -- where we would be maxing out. So I certainly wouldn't think of the 25% as a cap in any way say perform. We really believe that there's more room to grow here from a margin perspective. As again, we really continue to make good progress on organic growth with strong incremental margins.","Walter Liptak","And then if I can ask you a follow-up on the food equipment question that was answered, I think earlier this year, you talked about mid-single digit growth for that segment and I wonder if that's what we're still looking for, because you're a little lower in the first half. Is there enough line of sight on business in the second half to be mid-single digit for the full year?","Michael Larsen","I think we probably -- this year, I think long term, certainly we have a lot of conviction around being able to grow the food equipment business in the mid-single digits, which would be 200 to 300 basis points above market. Right now, a little bit of a slowdown on the market side. We talked about that. And for this year, we\u2019ll probably be slightly below mid-single digits in terms of organic growth in the food equipment business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Barry Haimes of Sage Asset Management. Sir, your line is open.","Barry Haimes","I wanted to just follow-up on one comment you made earlier that you thought steel pressure might ease some in the second half and it's widely expected the section 232 decision is going to be out fairly shortly, which arguably could have upward pressure. So I'm just curious what you're seeing in the marketplace that makes you think that steel could come off in the second half? Appreciate that. Thanks.","Michael Larsen","Yeah. I mean I think we are seeing a slight moderation on steel prices right now. The tariff really, I mean that\u2019s anyone's guess. If that were to happen, then we will react accordingly.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. We show no further questions in queue.","Michael Larsen","All right. Thank you, Bob. Thanks for dialing in and have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11435":["Illinois Tool Works, Inc.

At this time, all participants will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","Now, I'll turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may now begin.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's first quarter 2017 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our first quarter financial results and update you on our 2017 earnings forecast.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the second quarter and full year 2017 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide.","We refer you to the company's 2016 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. And while we use very few non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thanks, Michael, and good morning. Overall, we're off to a good start in 2017. Organic growth improved to 3.5% in Q1 due to a combination of improving end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments and continued progress on our pivot to growth efforts across all seven of our segments.","We were able to leverage this improving organic growth performance into very strong earnings growth, with EPS up 19% year-on-year in the quarter, 21% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.","Operating margins of 23.3% were up 120 basis points and were the highest in the history of the company, despite 50 basis points of margin dilution from the EF&C acquisition. After-tax return on invested capital improved 260 basis points to 23.8%.","As you saw based on our Q1 performance, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint and raising our full year organic growth rate forecast to a range of 2% to 4%. Overall, our Q1 performance reflects another solid step forward for the company. And I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for all their hard work and their deep commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence.","As a result of their ongoing efforts, I have no doubt that we will continue to make strong progress on the path to ITW's full potential through the balance of 2017 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q1 performance and 2017 forecast. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Starting with slide 3, GAAP EPS increased 19% to $1.54, 21% excluding the effects of currency translation. As Scott noted a minute ago, organic growth was 3.5% in the quarter.","Total revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 6%. Six of our seven segments had positive organic growth and Welding improved to flat. Organic growth was positive in all major geographies, with North America up 1.4% and International up 6.4%, driven primarily by Europe, which was up 6% and China, which was up 19%.","We increased operating margin 120 basis points over last year, which was driven by continued progress on our enterprise strategy initiatives and volume leverage.","Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of margin expansion. The 2016 acquisition of EF&C diluted margin by 50 basis points. So on an apples-to-apples basis, operating margin improved 170 basis points. Six of seven segments increased operating margin. And excluding the EF&C margin impact and Auto OEM, all segments improved.","Operating income grew 12% to $809 million, the highest quarterly total in the company's 105-year history. Our effective tax rate was 28.3% in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations as we adopted new FASB guidance for stock-based compensation effective January 1. The new guidance requires that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense rather than equity.","Free cash flow of $399 million was 74% of net income, which is in line with typical seasonality. That said, in Q1, free cash flow was impacted by the timing of some tax and pension items. Adjusted for these items, free cash flow conversion would have been even better at 91%.","On slide 4, you can see that we achieved an all-time record for operating margin in the quarter. This was largely driven by the continued strong execution on our enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of structural margin improvement and volume leverage contributed 80 basis points.","As expected, price\/cost was slightly unfavorable in Q1 due primarily to higher steel prices. At current raw material costs and with our 2017 price adjustments, we expect that price\/cost for the full year will be positive in dollar terms and slightly unfavorable 10 to 30 basis points to margin percentage. As we've discussed before, we don't expect that price\/cost will have a material impact on our results in 2017.","Turning to slide 5, on the left side of the page, overall organic growth in Q1 improved 1.5 percentage points versus Q4 due to meaningful improvement in end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, continued strong and above plan organic growth from our Auto OEM segment, and continued progress on our pivot to growth efforts across all seven of our segments.","I'll now discuss the segment results in a little more detail, starting with Automotive OEM, which delivered another strong quarter with above plan organic revenue growth of 9%, 300 basis points above global car builds. In North America, 4% organic growth exceeded auto builds of 3% overall and 1% for the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content. Outside North America, growth continued to be very strong, with Europe up 12% or 600 basis points above market. China was up 29%, significantly above market as we continue to increase our content per vehicle, particularly with domestic OEMs.","Despite the strong performance in Q1 and a positive outlook for Q2 for our Auto OEM business, IHS is still forecasting a decline in domestic auto builds in the second half. Our full year guidance incorporates the IHS forecast as it currently stands, which results in full-year organic growth for our Auto OEM business of approximately 3%.","Turning to slide 6. Food Equipment was up 2% organically. North America was up 1%, with stable demand for equipment up 2%. Internationally, both equipment and service were up 3%. Operating margin improved 60 basis points to 25.1%.","We had a strong quarter in Test & Measurement and Electronics, both businesses grew organic revenue by 6%, with strong demand in semiconductor-related end markets. In Test & Measurement's Instron business, where demand is tied more closely to business investment, organic growth was up 5%, which is certainly an encouraging sign. Operating margin improved 450 basis points to 20%. The 20% includes 350 basis points of the non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets.","Turning to slide 7, Welding organic growth was flat in Q1, which is a significant improvement versus down 8% in Q4. Excluding normal seasonality, demand improved 3% sequentially from Q4 to Q1.","Year-over-year, equipment was up 1% and consumables were down 1%. By geography, North America, which is approximately 80% of our business, was up 2%, driven by our commercial equipment business. Our commercial equipment business, which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication, and farm and ranch customers, was up 4% year-on-year in Q1. Our industrial equipment business, which sells primarily to manufacturing, including automotive and heavy equipment, was down 1% in the quarter. Operating margin performance was the highest in the company at 27.7%.","Polymers & Fluids delivered another solid quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 2%. Bulk (09:51) Fluids, which primarily sells highly engineered lubricants and cleaners into industrial and commercial end markets and automotive aftermarket, grew 2%.","Polymers, which primarily sells adhesives and sealants for industrial MRO and other OEM applications, was essentially flat. Operating margin was 20.6%, which includes 420 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets.","On slide 8, Construction Products was up 3% organically, despite a challenging comparison. Demand in North America was solid with organic growth down 2% compared to up 11% in Q1 last year. Commercial was down 1% and residential was down 2%. And as we've discussed before, the quarterly revenue numbers here can be a little lumpy. International growth was strong, with Europe up 8% and Asia Pacific up 5%. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 22.5%.","Finally, in Specialty Products, organic revenue was up 1%, with strong organic growth of 8% in our consumer packaging businesses. Operating margin was 26.9%, an increase of 80 basis points.","Turning to slide 9 and our updated guidance for 2017. As a result of our strong Q1 results and assumptions for the balance of the year, we're raising our full year earnings guidance by $0.20 to a new EPS range of $6.20 to $6.40. The $0.20 raise is essentially $0.10 from the first quarter beat, plus $0.06 from higher organic growth, and $0.04 from a slightly lower tax rate of 29%.","At current levels of demand, we now expect higher organic growth of 2% to 4%, which, as mentioned previously, includes the IHS forecast for North American Automotive business in the second half of the year.","For the full year, we continue expect that operating margin will exceed 23.5%, with 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from our enterprise initiatives. Finally, for the second quarter, our EPS guidance is $1.55 to $1.65 with organic growth of 2% to 4%.","With that, we'll now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is now open, sir.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Morning guys. Nice quarter.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you give us a little more color on your Welding business? You had forecast it to be down, I think, low single-digits for this year. It was flat at 1Q as you said. Comparisons, I think, get easier as the year goes on. So would you expect it to grow now?","And then maybe more interestingly, I don't know if I remember a time when your Welding margins have been higher than 27.7%. You did almost 400 basis points higher margins this year versus last year on similar demand. So how do we think about Welding? Could you potentially do 400 basis points higher than the last peak in 2014, which was about 26%? Where is the peak here?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, I don't know if we can give you a peak. What I can tell you is, relative to where margins peaked that you referenced in terms of the, I think you said 2014, certainly, the impact of the enterprise initiatives that we have been implementing across the company have been taking place in Welding right along with the rest of the company. So what you're seeing in terms of improved margin performance is starting to turn the corner, obviously, in terms of demand and revenue, and the benefits of those enterprises initiatives are now starting to come through in a little bit more of a visible way, let's say, relative to an environment where we're down mid to high single digits.","So they've done a lot of really strong work despite a very tough environment over the last three or four years in terms of the enterprise initiatives. And I think as Michael noted in terms of the demand environment, we were certainly encouraged by some noticeable improvement primarily in the commercial end of our equipment business. But even the industrial down, I think, 1% in Q1 was a noticeable improvement in terms of what we've been seeing over the last six quarters or so. So things appear to be stabilizing there, getting better on the commercial end. And if we continue on this path, obviously, it will have some pretty good impact in terms of our performance through the balance of the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that, Scott. And then, look, I mean, you had over 40% incrementals in the quarter and that was despite dilution from EF&C and you mentioned price\/cost being a drag. I think at the Analyst Day, you mentioned variable margin at 50% in ITW. So is it reasonable to assume that if organic growth stays toward the higher end of your new range that you could do incrementals well over your normal 35% target?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","So Andrew, incremental margins, as you pointed out of \u2013 if you look straight off the P&L, we're 44%, certainly, really solid performance. If you add back the impact of EF&C, we are in the 77% range for incrementals. We talked about this on the call last time that, in the short term, we could see incremental margins above our long-term average of 30% to 35% until investments in overhead and other areas catch up to support the growth. Our view, long term, is we would still expect to be in that 30% to 35% range for incremental margins, but certainly well above that here in the near term.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","But Michael, you don't have any new investments that you're making this year versus what you did in the first quarter, right, and pretty much steady as she goes?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. No, we're always investing and the levels we're investing at now are similar to what we have been doing in prior years.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Davis from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Hi, Scott. Good morning.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Trying to get a sense, one of the things that was encouraging that you said was around the Test & Measurement business recovering, and organic growth up 6% is a real encouraging number. And can you give us a little bit of color behind that? I mean, are you seeing customers really responding with some CapEx spend? Is there some pent-up demand, is there \u2013 was there any business pushed from 2017 \u2013 I'm sorry, from 2016 budgets into 2017 budgets that can account for that or \u2013 been trying to see if there's a real recovery here that you're seeing or something more short term in nature.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, I think it's \u2013 from my perspective, Scott, it's hard to tell at this point. I think the overall order \u2013 we typically operate with very little backlog, very little forward visibility. The uptick in demand in Test & Measurement is certainly encouraging at this point but it's only a quarter. I think we have a general view, that I think many people share, that the overall business investment climate has been very depressed for the last six to eight quarters that, as a result, there is some pent-up demand that should conditions overall \u2013 the economy overall begin to improve even modestly that that will be a stimulus in terms of bringing some more comfort around investment back into the picture. So we're certainly hopeful that this is the start of something \u2013 a more positive turn in that direction, but I think after one quarter, I don't think we're ready to call it that yet.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair enough. And then just as a follow-on, I mean you have a bit of a \"high quality problem\", if you want to call it that, of you're going to generate an awful lot of cash in 2017 even if 1Q is seasonally weaker, it's going to start piling in. Is there a appetite for higher level of buybacks, if there's anything out there that \u2013 would your appetite for M&A go up a tad with this increased cash?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I think, (18:42) Scott, nothing's really changed in terms of how we look at capital allocation. You're right that we're fortunate that we have a strong balance sheet and we generate free cash flow well above net income on an annual basis.","In terms of the buybacks specifically, we have planned for $1 billion of buybacks in 2017 starting with $250 million. In the first quarter we have done that and certainly we're on track to execute on that program. To the extent that there is surplus capital, we'll address that as we go through the quarter and we'll update you on the earnings calls if that number can go higher from here.","But certainly, we're off to a good start on free cash flow. I'd say on the M&A environment, we've talked about this on prior calls, our views haven't really changed. And just because we're sitting on more cash, doesn't mean that we will not be disciplined in terms of how we look at M&A.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, I understand. Nicely done. I normally don't say this, guys, but boy, you're really executing. In the couple years I've covered your stock, it's been pretty amazing, so keep up the good work.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good morning, guys.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Look, hard to not like this quarter. It was a very strong quarter. I guess the question I have, to start off, maybe on price\/cost, you mentioned that you were going to start to put through some pricing increases. So maybe, Michael, if you can talk about the cadence and when you start to expect to see some of the benefit from those pricing increases, that would be helpful.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yes. So those price increases, Joe, have largely been done already. So that's based on what's been implemented year-to-date. So there's really nothing major outstanding from a price standpoint.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so was that kind of across the portfolio? And specifically, I guess I'm thinking about Welding, one of your competitors had talked about positive pricing in an earlier report. And so I was just wondering whether you're able to see some price impact there as well.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yes, we're seeing positive price increases in all of our segments.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, helpful. And then I guess just maybe some additional color on the thoughts on Auto. I know that you're baking in 3%. If I want to be clear here, I guess is 3% market or is that 3% growth in your numbers for 2017? And...","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, that's 3% in our business, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's 3% in your business. Okay. Got it. So there's some \u2013 perhaps some opportunity there. And, I guess, lastly, maybe just a little bit more color on Welding. Clearly, things got \u2013 things are seemingly getting better with the flat growth number this quarter. Maybe talk a little bit more about the trends that you're seeing across the different end markets I caught that industrial was down slightly, but helpful to get additional color there.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, I think I'd just go back to what I said earlier that \u2013 and this is, at least in terms of our sort of past history, this is what we're seeing in the first quarter, the normal signs of a recovery in the welding space. The commercial end for us of the equipment space typically leads the turn, if you will, and so the commercial business was up 4% in the quarter, which was a nice improvement in terms of uptick relative to not just percentage growth but on a sequential basis, up noticeably from Q3.","So things are setting up for a nice turn in the marketplace. But again, I think after one quarter, we're \u2013 what I would say, not to sound like the pessimist here, but we've been here before a few times, right? With a reasonable start to the year over the last two or three years and then things in terms of the overall economic environment kind of have petered out. So I think that experience has us a little cautious in terms of posture, but I would say that we're certainly seeing some signs, even in those prior periods that we didn't see before, that give us some level of hope or optimism that we're seeing some broader based recovery than maybe we have in the past that hopefully will sustain itself as we continue to move through this year and beyond.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Morgan Stanley, Nigel Coe.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just, obviously, a very strong quarter. 2Q, your range for $1.55 \u2013 $1.65 on 2% to 4% organic. In my model, that implies that you're embedding a much flatter margin than what we've seen recently. Anything to think about there or is it just you just want to be conservative?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I think it's primarily, Nigel, the comp to last year, we had a really strong Q2 last year and that's really the main driver here.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, okay. And then, obviously, within that Auto, we saw the 2 points or so from EF&C. Should we then think about 2Q Auto similar to 1Q and a bit of pressure year-over-year, and then as we get to the second half of the year, more of a normalized comp?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's a reasonable assumption. I think the plus 9% organic in Q1, we may not get all the way there in Q2. But certainly, we feel good about the second quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then just finally, on Electronics, obviously, there's a pretty volatile pattern quarter-to-quarter there, and you got a strong 6% in 1Q. We are seeing semi CapEx pretty strong this year. Would you expect that kind of performance to continue through the year?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","When we look at the full year in Test & Measurement, we're looking at growth in the low single-digit range. So part of what you see in Q1 is also a fairly easy comparison on a year-over-year basis. So certainly encouraging what we've seen. I'd point to Instron and the businesses tied to business investment as really the more meaningful data point here in Q1. Semiconductor as you know, is really hard to forecast, but we feel good about where we are right now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking the call.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Through Q2 we... (25:24)","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Through Q2, yes, on the semi-con side. Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a question on kind of the mix. In the past, you've talked about consumer being 60%, industrial being 40%. We're starting to see some of the consumer markets see a relatively slower growth potential going forward. And I'm just wondering, some of the pushback we get on the stock is related to that historical 60-40 comment. Could you help us understand whether this split is kind of migrating closer to 50-50 and could be less of a drag on growth?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Near term, I think the sort of macro, from my standpoint, is we are \u2013 the industrial side, given the very sluggish business investment environment, has been the slower growing part of the company. That is seeming to improve. Obviously, if that continues, that will adjust that mix a percentage point or two over time. But I don't see it shifting dramatically off of that 60-40 mix.","I think the most \u2013 beyond the end market recovery, the other thing I'd point to, as we've talked before, is we've got plenty of room to grow. In all seven of our businesses, we are continuing to make good progress in terms of the work we need to do on that pivot, and so consumer or industrial, all of our seven businesses have plenty of room to run in terms of ability to drive above-market organic growth from here forward.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Scott. And then on the Welding, we compare the Welding segment to some of your external competitors, the margin continues to be quite a premium to what those external competitors are generating. But this quarter the organic growth was a little lighter. I'm just wondering, should we look at the mix a little bit closer, your segment versus the competition, or said differently, do you feel that Welding \u2013 and I know it's one quarter, but...","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","You know the answer before you're going to ask it.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's why I'm qualifying it.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, I appreciate the point. What we have said, I think, on numerous occasions is quarterly comps, particularly given some of the differences in relative product positions between us and the other great companies in this space, I think are really not particularly meaningful.","We don't take credit for them when they work in our favor and in cases where they don't, I wouldn't read too much into what I think the overall \u2013 I think it's a fair comparison on an annual basis, certainly not one that's particularly valid in my mind on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And even on an annual basis, there are still big differences in terms of relative product mix across all the different parts of the Welding portfolio. So you'll have to draw your own conclusions on that.","But I think quarter-to-quarter, there's just too much stuff that is individually impacting all the various companies in different ways that makes it less relevant, I think, to add it up as a \u2013 in the aggregate sense. And again, I think we're as consistent about saying that when it works in our favor as it does when it \u2013 as we are when it doesn't.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is now open.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I guess, maybe looking at 1Q, very good performance. You beat your guidance by $0.10. I'm wondering, as you look internally versus your initial projections, what were some of the more notable variances? And how did these variances at segment level play out in the way you adjusted full year guidance?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, I think we've talked about it, Mig. The big delta was the organic growth rate and the drivers of that delta in terms of organic growth rate were Automotive, Test & Measurement, Welding. And based on \u2013 we've talked before about the fact that we forecast based on current run rates, so our balance of the year forecast does reflect those improvements that we saw in Q1 in those businesses.","Auto was a bit of an exception, as Michael talked about earlier. I think we're taking a very conservative approach. We understand that there're some issues out there in North America on the back half of the year that may or may not impact demand for our products. But we're using the data that we have externally and fully baking that in. But beyond that, everything else is run rated through the balance of the year based on the exit rate in the first quarter.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. So maybe ask this differently, have you changed your margin assumptions for Welding for the full year?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, we have not.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Then my follow-up is on Food Equipment. Maybe a little more color as to what you're seeing in North America here. Any split that you can point to in terms of your restaurant versus your commercial customers, refrigeration versus cooking, et cetera?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think a lot has changed. What I would say is that we did have some \u2013 a few good sized project pushout into Q2. So, in terms of Q1 growth rate, it was a little light relative to what we thought it was going to be heading into the quarter but not by much. We're still expecting, on a global basis, 3% to 4% organic growth in Food Equipment for the year.","And we've talked before, we got a really strong new product pipeline. We are making great progress across the business both in North America, in Europe and in Asia in terms of driving those new products and our other pivot to growth penetration efforts and feel really good about the balance of the year there. So, no big changes in terms of end market demand color.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from JPMorgan, we have Ann Duignan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","We've seen the results of the French elections overnight, and I'm just curious if any of your businesses in Europe and\/or in particular in France, so was there any hesitation in spending by customers into the election and whether you feel there might be any pent-up demand that are going into Q2 or the back half of the year just a kind of a relief rally, if you like?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","We're still trying to figure out who they voted for.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. They voted for the right one (32:48) so far.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. Ann, so how I would maybe put this in context, our sales in France represent about 5% of our overall sales. And we were actually up 3% in the first quarter, really driven by Construction and Automotive primarily. And so I think it's a little too early to tell whether anything has changed at this point. We still feel good about the outlook for Europe.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And you didn't feel \u2013 I guess, my point was more Europe broadly, you didn't feel there was any hesitation in spending in other countries?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, we didn't see anything like that.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I just wanted to follow up on your outlook for Automotive. I mean, you noted a few times that your forecast is based on IHS, but you seemed a little skeptical of their outlook. What are you hearing from your customers? I mean, are you \u2013 do you feel that IHS may be a little bit low?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, I wouldn't say that. Our visibility is about a quarter ahead, so for now, what we see is second quarter is set up pretty well. Beyond that, we're just reacting to an IHS forecast that says that there's \u2013 I think the number's negative 10 for the Big 3 in the back half of the year. And that's some production \u2013 that's some extended shutdowns due to some model changeovers and things \u2013 all those things may be very valid. So we are trying to incorporate the best data that we have.","I don't mean to sound skeptical at all. If I did, that's my mistake. But I think what we're trying to convey is that we've got that all baked in, in terms of our balance of the year organic growth forecast, and still expect the overall company to be better than we did heading into the year.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color on that. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. I just wanted to come back to Welding one more time, I apologize in advance. But I'm curious if you would mind sharing \u2013 you mentioned commercial up stronger, what's sort of the mix in commercial and industrial in that business? And would there be a margin mix issue where, I assume, maybe the commercial might have a little bit higher margins or maybe not?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I think the mix is roughly 50-50. It's close to that. And from a margin standpoint, I think they're also pretty comparable. So no, shouldn't have any material mix impact on margin.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then maybe on Test & Measurement and Electronics, in the past, you've had an occasional quite large customer who would occasionally come up with big new product launches that would be reflected in your sales of equipment of that kind.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Who shall remain nameless?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yes.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Who shall remain nameless. See, I'm doing a good job here.

What areas are really growing, and maybe are there niches that you're not really participating in? Just, you've been kind of growing a little bit slower than some of the other areas, it seems, for a couple of years.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, I think how I would answer that is we're pretty focused on dishwashing, refrigeration, cooking and scales in the retail sector. We have really strong positions \u2013 relative share position in service \u2013 don't let me leave out service, is the other big opportunity. I'm not going to give you our assessment of our global share, but let's just say, we got plenty of room to grow in those areas. So from the standpoint of, is the growth going \u2013 as our focus in terms of go forward growth around getting it to new areas, that's not a big focus for us. Our focus is on really leveraging the full potential of the really strong positions that we already have.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So just more of a service focus and just kind of a little bit of increased penetration?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Service, warewash, refrigeration, cooking.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.

Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I think the only thing I'd point to is on the price\/cost side, we are a little cautious given what we saw in Q1, and so that's why we didn't take the margin guidance up.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","But Michael did add a bold (38:44) point to the plus. Maybe you didn't catch that in there.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah, no, I noticed. Okay. Great. And then, just \u2013 I know you mentioned you have about a quarter of visibility on some of your businesses or maybe across the business in general. When do you expect to generate that other dime of earnings? Is it balanced across the rest of the year or does the one quarter visibility weight that to Q2 leaving you some further upside potential later in the year?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I'd say it's pretty balanced. Actually, if you look at our Q1 EPS and you add the midpoint of our guidance for Q2, we're exactly at 50% of the year from a full year EPS standpoint. So that's \u2013 historically, that's what we've been doing for a long time. So it's pretty even.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. Nice quarter.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess, two questions. One, was there anything unusual about the cadence of sales throughout the first quarter? Did it follow the typical seasonal trend and sort of what you're seeing into April?","And then my second question within Construction, Europe saw some pretty nice growth, and I know that's a business that you guys have been restructuring. So was that \u2013 did you grow in line with the market, above market? I'm just wondering whether we're starting to see the benefits from your organic growth initiatives. Thanks.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I can share that the (40:17) monthly, the cadence, this was a pretty typical quarter. There was really nothing unusual there. Construction Europe, we certainly benefited from some end market lift, being up 8% in Europe. I think there's still some work to do, as you know, from a simplification standpoint. But overall, encouraged by the progress in our Construction business in Europe.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And sorry, any commentary on April, if that's falling in line with seasonal trend or...?","Michael M.

Your line is now open.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just on the Auto outgrowth considerations into the back half of the year, if you think about mix effect with declines potentially in North America, and you think about some of the Europe outgrowth you've been posting recently, and I think that picked up in the back half of the year, but just how we should be thinking about that. If North America's down, of course that means (41:23) a little bit of a mix benefit to outgrowth, but I don't know if Europe gets harder on tougher comps.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, I think what I would say is we expect overall, globally, to outgrow the market 200 to 400 basis points, consistent with what we have said in the past. Exactly how that plays out in the back half, we'll have to see.","Clearly, in Europe, we're running above that rate; and China, significantly above that average penetration rate.

And good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi and our CFO Michael Larsen. ","During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our first quarter financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. Before we get to the results let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 second quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on the slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2014 Form 10-K for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures; a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. ","So with that, I will turn at this time over to Scott.","Scott Santi","Thanks, Aaron and good morning. Overall, a solid start to the year for the company as we delivered earnings per share at $1.21, an increase of 20% over the last year and $0.04 higher than the midpoint of our forecast. And that was despite an additional $0.03 of currency headwind versus where rates were when we issued our Q1 guidance on January 27. In the quarter we were able to deliver stronger performance despite a challenging macro environment. We continued to focus on executing and the things that are within our control and our business teams around the world continuing to do a very good job of doing just that, as evidenced by the 220 basis point operating margin improvement that they delivered in the quarter. ","Q1 operating margin of 20.9% matched the all-time record high for the company set in Q3 of last year. Enterprise strategy initiatives, good tactical cost management and favourable mix as a result of our product line simplification program drove the bulk of the margin increase. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 2% gross, 1% net including the impact of the product line simplification. This was below our 2% to 3% forecast as weaker capital spending generally and the oil and gas sector specifically resulted in modest year-on-year revenue declines in our welding test and measurement in electronics and specialty product segments. Despite the current macro challenges we are continuing to invest aggressively in support of our strategy to position ITW to deliver solid organic growth with world class margins and returns on capital. ","In the quarter we invested more than $150 million in capital expenditures restructuring and innovation programs. As you likely saw on our press release, we are taking our full year EPS forecast down by $0.15 to reflect foreign exchange rates. At the new midpoint of 510, full year EPS growth is 9% despite a translation impact of $0.40 negative. On a constant currency basis 15 EPS gross would be 18%; so overall a strong start for the year in a challenging environment. ITW is well positioned for another year of progress in 2015 and we remain solidly on track. The meter exceed our 2017 performance goals. ","I'll now turn the call over to Michael.","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Scott and good morning. Starting with the financial summary on page 4 and Scott mentioned first quarter EPS was a $1.21, an increase of 20% versus prior year and $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance. As expected Enterprise initiatives drove 100 basis points of margin expansion, which contributed to first quarter operating margin of 20.9% and operating income of 697 million. Also, good progress and after tax return on invested capital with an improvement of 210 basis points to 19.3%. Revenues were 3.3 billion, up 1% organically after the expected 1% impact from product line simplification. ","Foreign currency translation reduced revenues by 7% resulting in total revenues declining 6%. Pre-operating cash flow was strong at 359 million, more than a $100 million higher than last year. Also, during the quarter we were able to efficiently act as about 1.1 billion of cash outside of the U.S., which helped funding buyback of $1.6 billion. Overall; solid execution in a more challenging environment and stronger margin performance offset currency and lower revenues in some of our equipment businesses. ","Turning to revenue by geography; organic revenue was up 1% with growth in all major geographies except South America, which as a reminder represents less than 3% of our sales. North America was at 1% as a result of strengthened food equipment of 7% and automotive OEM of 3%. Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics were flat, while the specialty product was down 7%. International growth was up 1%. Q1 had a tough comparison. You may recall that last year international was up 6% in the first quarter. Europe was up 1% this quarter driven by automotive OEM up 13% partially offset by declines in welding, polymers and fluids and specialty products. ","Asia-Pacific was up 1% from strength in automotive OEM and food equipment, both up 5% offset by welding down 7%. China was solid and up 7% in the quarter with automotive food equipment and test and measurement on electronics all growing double digits. Overall, 2% gross organic revenue, 1% net after ongoing product line simplification activities reduced organic growth by 1%, and a mixed demand environment for some of our equipment related businesses. ","Margin performance continues to be a highlight, hence the operating margin improved by 220 basis points to 20.9%, which marked a new record for a first quarter and tied for best quarterly operating margin performance ever. The margin expansion as you can see is significant across every segment. On the right side you can see the key drivers of margin expansion this quarter with the largest contribution a 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Operating leverage was 20 basis points; price cost was also favorable 20 basis points. Finally, 80 basis points of improvement from cost management and the benefits of product line simplification for a total of 220 basis points. ","So in summary significant sustainable progress on operating margin in every segment through the execution of our strategy with more to come as we work towards our 2017 goals. On this page you can see the significant progress all the business teams have made on margin improvement over the first two years of this enterprise strategy. Five segments are now at or above 20% compared to only one segment when we started and overall 400 basis points of improvement, while much work is still ahead of us, significant progress and strong execution on the enterprise strategy so far. ","Also keep in mind that the reported margins for test and measurement and electronics and polymers and fluids, each include over 400 basis points of non-cash acquisition related amortization expense that will run its course over time. For your information we have included a schedule with the acquisition related amortization expense for each segment in the appendix. With that, let me provide some additional color about each segments performance in the first quarter. ","The automotive OEM segment has another really good quarter as organic revenue grew 7% and significantly outperformed worldwide auto builds of 1%. By geography, Europe stood out once again with revenues up 13% driven by new products and strong penetration gains across all platforms. In North America, our growth was slightly above auto builds at plus 3% as at Detroit 3 actually declined slightly versus the prior year. In China, organic revenues grew 14% outperforming auto builds by 8 percentage points. Profitability also improved with operating margin of 25%, 170 basis points higher than last year. ","In our test and measurement and electronics segments, organic revenue increased 1% in the quarter similar to the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Organic revenues in test and measurement declined 2% due to lower capital spending. And that said the largest division in test and measurement [indiscernible] was up 5% of the quarter. Electronics business was essentially flat with the other electronics platform up 2% offset by a slight decline in the electronic assembly platform. ","Operating margin increased 250 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and I already discussed the significant impact related to acquisitions. Food equipment is up to a good start with organic growth of 4%. In North America equipment was up 10% driven by new products and penetration gains in refrigeration and cooking. Internationally, equipment revenue was flat on a tough comparison. Service grew 4% in North America and 1% internationally. The segment's operating margin of 22.6% was 400 basis points higher than the prior year period driven by solid execution and lower restructuring. ","In the polymers and fluids segment, organic revenue declined 1% while operating margin expanded by 340 basis points as this segment reached 20% this quarter. Fluids and hygiene organic revenue was down 5% driven primarily by softness in Europe. Polymer was up a solid 4% and automotive, half the market was flat. And as I already mentioned, there is more than 400 basis points of noncash acquisition related intangible amortization impact in these segment's margins. Welding organic revenue was down 3% this quarter as a result of weaker demand in oil and gas related end markets. About 15% of this segment's revenues go into oil and gas and that particular part of the welding business, the oil and gas part, was down 30% globally. ","Excluding oil and gas, welding organic revenues would have been up about 3%. North America was flat with growth in commercial welding offsetting declines in oil and gas. International is down 13% driven primarily by oil and gas. Nevertheless, welding delivered 120 basis points of margin expansion as operating margin came in at 26.9%. The construction product segment produced organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter and margin expanded 118 basis points to 16.6%. ","North America was up 5% with growth in renovation and commercial while residential was flat. Asia-Pacific-East increased 1% for the quarter and Europe was up 1% as strength in the United Kingdom was partially offset by continued product line simplification. In specialty products organic revenue was down 6% due to ongoing product line simplification along with weaker equipment sales. North America was down 7 and international down 3. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 22.6%. ","So that wraps up the segment discussion and turning to our guidance for 2015 and the second quarter; we have updated our 2015 full year EPS guidance by $0.15 to reflect current exchange rates. We now expect full year EPS of $5 to $5.20, which is 90% growth at the midpoint or up 18% on the constant currency basis. Full year organic revenue growth is now forecast to be 1% to 2% due to a more challenging capital spending environment. As expected PLS remains at 1 percentage point drag throughout the year. And total revenue is expected to be down 5% to 6% as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency translation, which creates a 7% headwind at current rates. ","Given the strong first quarter results and continued positive momentum on margins we now expect that operating margin will exceed 21% for the full year. This includes approximately 100 basis points of margin improvement from enterprise initiatives. On capital allocation for the full year we now expect to allocate approximately $2 billion with share repurchases, while maintaining our target leverage ratio. ITW's board of directors authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program in the first quarter. ","For the second quarter, we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.22 to $1.30 with $0.15 of negative impact from currency headwinds, which is $0.05 higher than what we saw in the first quarter. Organic revenue growth should be up 1% to 2% and we expect operating margin of approximately 21% which again includes approximately100 basis point from enterprise initiatives. So that summarizes our guidance and as you can see in a more challenging environment ITW continues to be well positioned to deliver another year of strong progress in 2015. ","With that, let me turn it back over to Aaron.","Aaron Hoffman","Thanks Michael. We\u2019ll now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question and remember our policy of one question and one follow up question.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from John Inch from Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","I just want to ask about -- kind of do a fine point on the guide. You basically sort of suggesting that the bulk of the reduction is currency and if you look at the way this sort of plays out that would proportionately hit mostly in the second quarter, but you did take organic growth for the year down and so my question is really if you could parse between what you\u2019re seeing in terms of end markets and the context of reducing guidance second quarter versus the rest of year. Like for instance, why doesn\u2019t the rest of the year come down further if you\u2019re seeing systematic weakness as many companies are, so I\u2019m just trying to understand the moving parts here?","Michael Larsen","Yes so John let me try to answer that, so the way we\u2019ve modeled the rest of the year is based on current run-rates. And so based on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of revenues and orders in our businesses today. So we\u2019re not assuming that things improve from here or deteriorate from where we are today. The other point around the guide, the adjustment that we\u2019ve made is $0.15 reduction just for currency. Here we are considering the lower organic growth rate but given the performance in the first quarter and the positive momentum on margins as well as a slight benefit from the lower share count we\u2019re projecting that we\u2019ll be able to offset those lower revenues with better margins, we\u2019re guiding to 21% plus operating margin today which is an improvement from where we were in January and we\u2019re getting a little bit of benefit from the accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter.","John Inch","Okay so better execution really is offsetting the lower organic I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re --","Michael Larsen","Yes.","John Inch","I think that's more or less what you\u2019re suggesting.","Michael Larsen","That\u2019s correct.","John Inch","And then Michael, the share repo for the year had been tagged last quarter to 1.5 billion you actually did 1.6 billion this quarter. So the question is sort of like how are you thinking about share repurchase for the rest of the year? Are you going to be sort of front loading that and then seeing how the rest of the year plays out or would do you think consider raising some financial leverage? I\u2019m just curious, because you obviously want to keep powder dry and I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about share repo particularly against the backdrop of what clearly has been some economic softening and that just may present more favorable entry points sort of purchase your shares in future quarters that\u2019s all?","Michael Larsen","Yes so John we\u2019re in line with past factors, we\u2019re not going to comment specifically on the timing of these share repurchases, but we\u2019ve said before that our goal is to remain opportunistic as we go forward. I\u2019d say in the first quarter the ability to access the foreign cash to the tune of about 1.1 billion is what helped fund the 1.6 billion of repurchase in the quarter which was essentially the guide that we\u2019d given for the year. We expect to do approximately 2 billion for the year and the balance we\u2019ll be opportunistic and we do not expect to increase leverage from here, certainly not to achieve the $2 billion. But as you know we have a strong balance sheet we generate a lot of cash with the ITW business model and given the diversity of our businesses, and so certainly we are open. But given what we\u2019re seeing today we\u2019re not expecting to increase our target leverage ratio beyond the 2.2 to 2.3 which is where we are right now. And we would like to be more opportunistic as we go forward for the balance of the year on the share repurchases.","John Inch","Sorry Michael just as a clarification you took your repo for the year from 1.5 to 2. You\u2019re sort of suggesting based on that was driven by the success [audio-gap] to repatriate 1.1 billion, does that imply that you had thought you\u2019re going to repatriate 600 but you\u2019re able to do 500 or excuse me but you\u2019re able to do 1.1 billion and that\u2019s the difference or is there something else?","Michael Larsen","No that\u2019s about right John, that\u2019s about right.","John Inch","And did you pay tax on that repatriation?","Michael Larsen","So our tax rate for the quarter at 31% as well as for the year we\u2019re still guiding to 30% to 31%, so we were able to do this in an efficient manner from a tax standpoint.","Operator","Your next question is from Mig Dobre from Robert Baird.","Mig Dobre","Looking maybe for a little more color on your CapEx comments I mean we know that mining and now there is energy CapEx is under a lot of pressure. But how do you think about CapEx trends more broadly outside of these three specific end markets?","Michael Larsen","I think we saw certainly soften up a bit in the quarter. I don't think it was anything overly dramatic but if you look at test to measurement and specialty in particular I think welding was largely impacted by oil and gas, there was other two segments. What I would say is in general we saw customers become a little bit more tentative about moving forward on capital expenditures again nothing overly dramatic, nothing that we can't we don't think we can power through, we go through the air, but right now the environment is certainly little choppy than it was as we ended the year.","Mig Dobre","Is it fair to say that you are starting to see hesitancy beyond these 3 end markets?","Scott Santi","I think actually surely not in for the equipment. So I think it's more for the industrial CapEx the food equipment business is much more tied to the consumer end the economy. They continue they saw there was else in the quarter continue to accelerate. There are also reaching a place from the stand point of their work through the enterprise initiative where they are how we focused on driving organic and I think you are seeing some of that progress show up. So I think we're again talking about test the measurement specialty in terms of more generalized CapEx spending softness and welding in particular which related to oil and gas.","Mig Dobre","Alright, that's great and sticking with food equipment here, as I understood from your comments you hint that potentially some share gains in North America any color their and really kind of what drove very good results their this quarter will be helpful.","Michael Larsen","We didn't hint in the share gains but sales were up 7% in the quarter in North America through a combination of as I said some continued 7% -- with the equipment are 10. Equipment up 10. overall up 7, thank you Michael and combination of continued mid product pipeline things in the market as well as a reaching the position they said earlier where they are much there in a position that really focus on driving organic.","Operator","The next question is from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andy Casey","On the industrial CapEx comments you described what you saw in North America during the quarter outside of the oil & gas sector. Specifically was there any improvement through the quarter or did it just remain choppy?","Michael Larsen","I think in general that was pretty flat through the quarter. Actually, no better or no worse in terms of January, February, or March. Right, I think this quarter was pretty\u2014the challenges we are talking about on the capital equipment side in oil & gas showed up fairly early in the quarter and we were able to take some cost actions here as we prepare for not just the quarter but for the rest of year. But you can't certainly the price that didn't accelerate in the quarter and didn't improve in the meaningful way from the run rate that we saw earlier on.","Andy Casey","Okay, thank you Michael and then is the same true of Europe and then let in somebody else ask.","Michael Larsen","You broke up a little bit. But I think this we saw the same trends essentially in Europe. Europe was a little bit weaker on the equipment side down slightly. But I think again the comps were pretty challenging. Europe was up 5% in the first quarter last year. So would be too much into that at this time. But also Europe, Asia-Pacific was really consistent as we went through the quarter.","Andy Casey","Thank you very much.","Michael Larsen","Sure.","Operator","Next question is from David Raso from ISI Research.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. On the second quarter question of the margin and also sales, on the sales it looks that the organic growth you are expecting to accelerate a little bit. I'm just trying to figure out, is that simply because comps get a little bit easier or is there something you are saying to suggest the organic could accelerate a bit?","Michael Larsen","We are sequentially, we historically we typically see an increase through the seasonality from Q1 to Q2. If you look year-over-year, we are guiding to 1% to 2% which is a little bit higher than what we saw here in the first quarter, but not significantly higher. Maybe the other way that was kind of what you\u2019re trying to get at is if you look at our EPS for the year this positions us at the first half earnings per share at about 48% of the year and 52% in the back end of the year so not a back-end loaded plan and very consistent with what we\u2019ve been able to deliver historically. So again we\u2019re not counting on acceleration here in terms of organic growth other than what we typically see, we\u2019d love to see one. We\u2019d love to take one, we\u2019d certainly take it, we\u2019re ready if it comes, but typically Q2 represents an improvement from Q1 on the top-line.","David Raso","Yes I was referring more to year-over-year and I know it\u2019s modest, but I was just curious\u2026","Scott Santi","And what I would add to that is go back to what Michael said before the comps move around, so we were plus 5 last year in Q1 and plus 1 in Q2.","David Raso","Yes I thought that as far as probably little more comp than it is you\u2019re not seeing the acceleration on organic. And then last one on the profitability, the last couple of quarters you have posted negative sales year-over-year but you\u2019re able to grow EBIT year-over-year. The second quarter you\u2019re implying sales down 7.5%, but EBIT does fall at detrimental call it 12%, 13%, 14% which still would be a good performance but just trying to understand what\u2019s the switch from now of sales decline pushes EBIT down when the last two quarters you\u2019re able to grow EBIT on sales decline just if there\u2019s something changed?","Michael Larsen","Yes no I think nothing fundamentally is really changing other than this is the toughest quarter from a currency standpoint, so if you look at the impact from currency on revenues and margins as well as EPS, Q2 is the bulk of it. When you translate this into earnings per share we have $0.15 of headwind here in the \u2013 10 in the first quarter, 15 in the second quarter and then the balance 15 remaining for the second half of the year for a total of 40, so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the outlook here for the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Joel Tiss from BMO.","Joel Tiss","A lot have been answered. I just wondered looks like the margin progress in the second quarter that you imply seems to slow down a little bit and I just wondered if you\u2019re seeing any challenges on really driving the kind of margin improvement going forward just because the low hanging fruit has been harvested already or is it more just currency and comparisons and shaky economy?","Michael Larsen","Actually on operating margins the things that are within our control I think the teams continue to do a really good job and we expect as we said a 100 basis points from the initiatives in the second quarter which is in line with the first quarter and in line with our expectations for the year if anything on the more technical cost management if you like so responding to what we\u2019re seeing in some of the equipment businesses I think we\u2019re doing a better job maybe on the discretionary cost side but I also think it\u2019s important to point out that we\u2019re not reducing our investment in terms of new products and restructuring and CapEx so we\u2019re continuing to move forward with those investment plans. So it\u2019s really I wouldn\u2019t say that we are performing at any different on the margin side in the second quarter and the balance of the year than we have in the past and certainly if anything the progress we\u2019ve made so far on margin expansion and we showed you the data for the last two years gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver the 23% target for 2017 so continued progress and driven by strong execution by the business teams that are focused on the things that are within our control so\u2026.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Can you talk about your relatively strong performance in construction you\u2019ve talked about expecting overall low single digit organic growth for the year which you delivered in the quarter but European construction turned positive I think for the first time in the year and U.S. commercial construction seems to be waiting through energy weakness, so can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in both the U.S. and Europe?","Michael Larsen","Yes I think overall this has been certainly what we\u2019re seeing over the last let\u2019s say three quarters or four quarters there\u2019s been kind of an up and down track record both geographically and also in terms of residential versus commercial versus remodel and I think first quarter overall was pretty good. We continue to be very focused on margin improvement in construction but I think what I would say and I swore we won\u2019t going to talk about the weather but given some of the weather in North America I think Q1 was actually a pretty solid quarter for our construction business and hopefully it sets up for some continued progress in terms of overall market demand as we move through the year.","Scott Santi","And then I would just add a comment on Europe. I mean I think you\u2019re right we did turned positive in the first quarter and a lot of positive momentum in certain regions particularly in the UK where we have a strong position. And then our upstate as you\u2019d expect by regions in some of the other parts of Europe maybe France, but overall good progress on margins as well on the construction side.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And then last quarter you talked about some execution of price cost getting better given lower material and oil cost and price cost did improve by 10 basis points can you talk about your ability to hold price in the current environment and then whether you expect the tailwind from lower raw material cost increase as the year continues?","Scott Santi","Yes so I think on price really nothing unusual in terms of our ability to realize price increases as well as announce according to the schedule we\u2019ve set out, so nothing has really changed on the price side. On the potential savings from the lower oil prices on the direct material side and also on the indirect transportation cost I think our business teams are working on it really hard. We saw little bit of benefit here in Q1 particularly in chemicals and resins, but I think it may take a little bit of time to fully play itself out here and so little too early to call what this maybe for the year but we did 20 basis points in the first quarter that\u2019s our assumption for the balance of the year and in line with what we\u2019ve seen over the last three quarters or four quarters or so. So no change, optimistic and we\u2019ll get more on the deflation side, but little too soon to call out a number at this point.","Operator","Your next question is from Evelyn Chow from Goldman Sachs.","Evelyn Chow","I guess first of all I just wanted to explore further your thoughts on some of the buybacks. I think I understand why you accelerated the share repurchase in 1Q, but looking for the rest of the year beyond what you have in free cash flow, I don\u2019t understand the toggle around the decision to repatriate versus potentially lever out through buybacks?","Michael Larsen","Yes so like I said we\u2019re -- given our business model and given our balance sheet and how much cash we generate, the current leverage ratio of about 2.2 times on a gross basis. We enjoy a solid credit rating [indiscernible] A, 2A plus, it gives actually as to credit markets on very favourable terms so we\u2019re very comfortable with our current leverage ratio we\u2019re not looking to go any higher from where we are today. ","The decision on what to do with available cash flow is we really go through a thought process that\u2019s in line with the capital allocation framework that we\u2019ve discussed on several occasions, so our number one priority which consumes about 25% of our total cash flow is to invest in the business for organic growth and for productivity so this is new products restructuring CapEx and we spend more than $150 million on that in the first quarter. ","We\u2019re committed to [indiscernible] an attractive dividend and so our dividend yield is competitive or in the 2% range at this point, that\u2019s approximately 25% of our total cash flows and so that leaves the balance which is a pretty big number for external investments and there are still acquisitions which we\u2019d love to do under the right conditions. We\u2019ve talked about what those are in the past and or share repurchases and some combination thereof and the decision is really made based on where we can get the best risk adjusted returns. And if you look at our share repurchase program over a long period of time we generate 12% to 13% returns with very low risk and given the visibility that we have into the performance of the company and given what we think overtime, we\u2019ll be able to deliver in terms of total shareholder returns and so that\u2019s really what drives that decision we committed in December to approximately 1.5 billion and we were able to do that a little bit sooner because we were able to access some of this overseas cash and we'll continue to look at opportunities to do that. We are saying approximately 2 billion for the year and let's see how it plays out and we'll keep you posted on the earnings call as we go forward.","Evelyn Chow","Okay, understood and then I guess just turning to welding for a second. Drilling down into your performance in the quarter down 3% organically, I think you said oil & gas on 30%, it's easiest comp of the year. Could you just provide maybe a little bit more clarity on your thoughts on the trajectory for the segment for the year?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean we don't get too fancy in trying to forecast too much. Like we said we were doing current run rate basis and so if in the first quarter we were down 30% we expect that to continue throughout the year, maybe a little bit better in the second half of the year in terms of the declines on the year-over-year basis. But not really counting on things getting a lot better or deteriorating significantly from here, I think the 30% decrease is pretty significant and maybe a little bit of reaction to the changing environment on the oil & gas side and I might just that following a very strong fourth quarter in that business and so fairly maybe a little bit faster we action than what we expected and a little bit more than maybe expected. But this is our assumption for the rest of the year that this run rate will continue.","Scott Santi","[indiscernible] businesses up 3 in the quarter.","Michael Larsen","Yes, on the commercial side we continue to see solid demand which in North American was enough to offset the decline in oil & gas.","Evelyn Chow","Great, thank you so much guys.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Rob Wertheimer","Hi, good morning. Just a follow up. I wanted to see if I can understand the oil & gas better. Is international down lot more in North America and if you are giving the North American oil & gas number, isn't international more upstream obviously [0:02:24.7] [prices] down just given the mix is in all that upstream, it's a lot bigger than we talk.","Michael Larsen","Yes, you are talking about the walling business specifically?","Rob Wertheimer","Correct.","Michael Larsen","The difference in the percentage is largely because most of our international sales in welding and oil & gas related. They are much more balanced portfolio in terms of their market exposure in North America. Participating in the same parts of the industry overall.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay. So the mix international would be most mid stream downstream than upstream?","Michael Larsen","Correct. We just like to higher concentration of our international welding in international welding revenues are tied oil & gas.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect and then if I may, is there any risk of an inventory build of the equipment or what not as the oil gas side of welding was down or is it contained with an oil & gas?","Michael Larsen","I don't think there is much risk. Our part of let's go to our methodology is for 98% of our loving product portfolio, our customers ordered today and we ship them tomorrow. So in terms of their sort of reaction to the current market environment and the changes that has in terms of the demand back to us, I think it's a pretty efficient system. So I don't think we're seeing much risk around inventory build.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher","Thanks, good morning. I'm wondering in which segment you expect to see the biggest impact from the increase internal focus on growth this year and even if that the segment that negative, where do you expect the biggest impact to be?","Michael Larsen","I think we are we talked about this before and lot of the work that we've done over the last 2 years plus is really about positioning ourselves internally totally drive and focus in a very efficient way and organic growth. So in terms of the organizational structure of the company in terms of product line simplification work we're doing right now that's largely about cleaning the clutter out and eliminating the distractions associated with product positions that are either not as differentiated as we want to focus on are ultimately too small to matter. ","So I would point to automotive and food equipment as the businesses that further down the path. I think the welding business certainly met up some of the current challenges in oil & gas is very well positioned. That's been a business that's growing organically at 9% plus for us since the mid 90's when we got in the business. So certainly we expect that one to start to accelerate as we go forward and then all of the others are at various stages on the path in terms of the [indiscernible] work needed to focus on driving organic. Constructions continue to make progress, build some big restructuring going on in Europe there, polymers and fluids was probably the most fragment that complex structure where I think getting to the back side of what they use to do really get in position to drive organic growth. So I think come a long as we've talked before this is the transition year, 16 to POS impact starts to drop considerably and I think we are in a position to but having in the next year. That's the plan.","Steven Fisher","Great and then automotive your business tour you have bit more with this facility and so the 14% growth in China in the quarter. I know you said few times that thinking about the rest of year I knew the run rate. But increase visibility and how do you think that 14% in China and goes rest of the year?","Michael Larsen","Hey, Steve. Could you re-ask that question? You dropped out in the middle of it and I just want to make sure we hear your question properly to answer it properly.","Steven Fisher","Sure. Sorry about that. I was just saying that your automotive business tends to be one where you have a bit more visibility and the 14% growth in China in quarter and I know you've said a few times today that as you think about the rest of the year for you businesses you tend to sort of just run rate. But because you have that more visibility in automotive and how do you think about that 14% growth in China over the rest of the year?","Scott Santi","I think we are well set up there, as you describe that the automotive business. What we are selling today really across the world are is a function of penetration gains that we engineered and invented and sold in going back 2 and 3 years. So I think the run rate is really solid running going through rest of this year, the pipeline is terrific in terms of future years and we continue to be very boyish and what we think we can do with this business long-term.","Operator","The next question is form Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions. One, I mean I know the focus largely has been more on internally igniting organic growth and share repurchase. But can you talk it all about just sort of the deal pipeline it all becoming more attractive your interest in larger versus smaller deals and what you are seeing in terms of evaluation and then I'll get back in queue.","Michael Larsen","Nothing is really, I think we're pretty clear in our December Investor Day meeting around where we see M&A fitting in terms of our overall enterprise strategy largely focused on building on businesses to our existing segments that we think can either help, support or further accelerate the organic growth rates. No magic from the side standpoint but certainly something that's comfortably in a $100 to $500 million range, in that regard. So ultimately that's opportunistic. We will access those opportunities as we find M&A come available to us. We are certainly focused right now on getting this product to organic growth firmly in place. So from the standpoint of pipeline it's we got a few things out there that are absolutely fits that we are working in terms of both answers to some of our existing businesses. But I don't expect that particularly robust from the standpoint of overall deals done.","Jamie Cook","But just to clarify, do you feel anymore I guess pressure look distort you've far exceeded I think everyone's expectations on margins and how successful you've been and the macro obviously has been a bigger head wind to more strong companies and you've done a great job. But do you feel like you could be more opportunistic? I mean to help the organic growth by doing deal at this point.","Michael Larsen","I don't think there is any change in past year or aggressive it's ultimately about how does it fit, how does it help us do what I just described and once we really not going to react on a short term basis. This is as we've laid out a 5 year plan to position the company to generate 12% to 14% TSR on a consistent basis and the big [indiscernible] is really driven by an organic finance. So that remains our focus right now. This is also 5 year plan, not a 5 quarter plan. It's all about positioning the company coming out of 2017 could be able to perform like we think again and so we're focused on making that happen and we made a lot of progress and you are kind of note that we've got lot more work to do to get where we think we can get over the next 2.5 years.","Operator","The next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMC.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning. I'm from JP Morgan. Most of my questions have been answered. Maybe just back to your comments on CapEx spending and been kind of whole through the course of the quarter. Are any of your customers and any of the segments growing concerned about the strong dollar and what's that doing to export or do you think it's just general uncertain, any color you could give us will be great?","Michael Larsen","I think the impact and export competitiveness is in my view probably driving some of the softness in CapEx particularly obviously in North America. I think there are some shifts and some adjustments that our customers are making around how this change in relative currency rates are impacting their competitiveness from an expert standpoint. So I think if they are sorting out what is likely to happen to whatever business they are exporting from North America given this change in structure geographic competitiveness. I think that's in large part driving some of the softness around CapEx.","Ann Duignan","And now you are seeing that any specific segment?","Michael Larsen","I think as we go back to TNM probably little bit on the industrial side of welding in our specialty business where which is the equipment that was largely packaging or maybe the packaging equipment.","Ann Duignan","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on share repurchase I mean your stock is trading at a significant premium to the S&P and trading inline with the large capital [consumers]. What kind of analysis do you do internally to either decide to accelerate through the purchases or hold under the cash for better opportunity?","Michael Larsen","I think I'll go back to what I said earlier is that these are long term decisions that we make and they are really based on highly disciplined approach and being very returns focused. This share repurchase program has been a terrific program for the company and certainly for the shareholders. The alternative which is holding under the cash as you know is not very attractive today and certainly relative to the share repurchase program given our recent performance and given where we believe the company is headed which we've been very public about in terms of the goals and we rate out for 2017 and beyond. We are confident that this continues to be a great way for us to allocate capital and so we're committed to the share repurchase program and we expected to continue be an active program going forward.","Scott Santi","I was there that better than the target leverage ratios we talked about earlier there is plenty of flexibility in there, opportunity come along.","Michael Larsen","Correct, yes.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I guess I was saying the more whichever consider a special dividend rather than share repurchases.","Michael Larsen","I think we look at all the options and we have not in the past done special dividends. But we'll certainly continue to look at all the options.","Ann Duignan","Okay, thank you. I leave it there. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning. Just one quick, you guys mentioned that the BSS headwinds should start to go in 2016. But I guess I'm assuming that's not really like a cliff event. So when do we really start to see that phase? Could it be in the second half of this year and then accelerate in '16 or might just being little optimistic there?","Michael Larsen","I think the question was wrong and then correct me if I'm wrong. Either BSS or PLS headwinds I'm not, can you just let me\u2026","Stephen Volkmann","Whatever headwinds you got of from and together?","Michael Larsen","I think the game plan, there is a lot of planning around this as we've got a full year of TLS activity in 2015, it's going to represent a 1% headwind to our organic growth rate. We are not in the 16 planning but magnitude it probably drops up by half in '16 and then fully done in '17 and beyond. This is a pretty big one time event it really is linked to our portfolio strategy. So we did a lot of work. At the front of the strategy around really building the portfolio that can sort of deliver this organic growth front end that we've talked about. So 30 businesses, the best that we've 3.5 billion of revenue. This is really stage 2 of that which is now working inside all of our divisions to basically take the same approach from a product line standpoint. So we're not pruning product lines that don't need our differentiation standards or that are too small to ultimately matter. So that's this is sort of phase two of portfolio management. But we work really hard on the last year, we can work hard on this year. I think we're going to start to truly get on top of it and it will be a lesser issue certainly in '16 and should be fully completed by '17.","Operator","The next question is from Walter Liptak from Global Hunter.","Walter Liptak","Hi, thanks and congratulation guys on getting the margin. I've got a couple of follow on, one it is just I want a little clarity on the oil and gas in North America. Basically how much is that down you think you could be down 30%, but doesn't sound like it is and second thing is on pricing. Are the own G customers looking for price declines your margin don't suggest it. But are you trying to help your customers with lower pricing?","Michael Larsen","Yeah. Oil and gas in North America was down at the rate we talked about earlier in the 30% range and from a pricing standpoint, we are not really planning that space and that's we're big enough sort of component of what they are having to buy. We're not really seeing a lot of pricing pressure, it's more a big slow down in actually the project work their that's impacting their demand for welding products.","Walter Liptak ","Okay, got it. And then follow on to the construction question. Is North American construction trending ahead of where you thought it was through the first quarter or is this inline I mean your comments of....","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think largely inline. The business was flat. We'll see how that plays out in the second quarter depending on whether remodel was up 3 and commercial was up 2 to 3 in North America. So reasonable better growth there, but I'll tell you largely inline with expectation.","Operator","There are no further questions from the phone.","Michael Larsen","Great, thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate that very much and we look forward to speak with everyone again soon.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the call. Today's conference is being recorded. Any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I'd like to turn over the meeting to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to ITW's first quarter 2018 conference call. This morning I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi, along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss first quarter financial results and update you on our second quarter and full year 2018 outlook.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the second quarter and full year 2018, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2017 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Got off to a solid start in 2018 with revenue up 8% and earnings per share up 23%. The ITW team continues to execute at a high level in the quarter as the combination of continued progress in implementing our enterprise initiatives, disciplined price\/cost management, and in improving demand environment resulted in strong overall operating performance, with operating income of $903 million, up 12%; operating margin of 24.1%, up 90 basis points; and after-tax return on invested capital of 27.7%, up 400 basis points.","Despite lower-than-expected global auto builds impacting our Auto OEM segment in the quarter, we delivered 3% organic growth, and all seven business segments and major geographies were up year-on-year. CapEx-related demand continues to strengthen in a number of our end markets, which is driving accelerated organic growth in our Test & Measurement and Electronics and Welding segments. Overall, based on our Q1 results, positive underlying demand trends across many of our businesses and a strong pipeline of projects and activities supporting our enterprise initiatives, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 at the midpoint.","I'll now turn the call over to Michael to provide you with more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. Let's start with chart number 3 and I'll add some color on our financial performance. As Scott mentioned, revenue was up 8%, with pretty solid demand trends and positive organic growth in all segments led by Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics, both up 8%. Operating margin improved by 90 basis points to 24.1%. After-tax return on invested capital was 27.7%, up 400 basis points, with the new U.S. tax legislation and our lower tax rate a key driver.","Free cash flow was $444 million, up 11% versus prior year, and was 68% of net income, which is in line with typical seasonality. We expect 100% conversion or better for the full year. To-date, we have repatriated over $1 billion in cash and expect to bring back another $1 billion by year-end. We accelerated our planned share repurchases to $500 million in the quarter. You will note that the tax rate was 23.2% in the quarter, slightly below our guidance midpoint of 25%, primarily as a result of the Q1 cash repatriation and a $14 million foreign tax credit benefit that resulted from that.","We now expect a slightly lower tax rate for the year relative to guidance, between 25% and 26% in quarters two through four, and a full-year average tax rate of 24.5% to 25.5%. And we continue to assess and clarify the provisions of U.S. tax reform, which could further impact our tax rate and future discrete items.","Moving to chart number 4 and operating margin, operating margin was 24.1%, up 90 basis points versus prior year and a new Q1 record. Five years into our current enterprise strategy, we're still generating 110 basis points of savings from the strong execution on our 80\/20 Front to Back Process and strategic sourcing initiatives.","As per usual, we report strategic sourcing savings as part of our enterprise initiatives benefits, not as part of price\/costs. But of that 110 basis points, roughly half was from sourcing initiatives. So if you match that up with price\/cost headwinds of 50 basis points in the first quarter, our sourcing initiatives actually more than offset the margin impact from raw material cost inflation.","As we have discussed previously, our strategy is to recover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We did that in Q1 with net price\/cost positive by $4 million in the quarter, and we expect to be positive in dollar terms again in Q2 and for the balance of the year. In fact, based on our price actions and known cost increases, we expect Q2 price\/cost margin impact to look similar to Q1, and then improve from there in the second half of the year.","While on the subject of price\/cost, I'd like to comment on the potential impact of tariffs on ITW. As many of you know, our model is to source and produce where we sell. We have incorporated what we currently know about the impact of Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs and the mitigating price actions into our business plan and company guidance. We're currently assessing the impact of proposed tariffs under Section 301. Bottom line, as we sit here today, we believe that price\/cost is manageable and we expect to continue to cover material- and freight cost inflation with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis as we go through the year.","Chart 5 provides some color on segment performance. We'll go through each segment individually, but I'd like to make a few points about overall performance first. The table on the left summarizes organic growth by segment for first quarter 2018 and compares it to organic growth for full-year 2017. You can see that our Q1 organic growth rate is similar to full-year 2017. Then we also provide our updated outlook for organic growth by segment for full-year 2018 to give you a better sense for the run rates and momentum on a full-year basis.","We previously provided these segment growth estimates at our Investor Day in December and, as you can see, not much has changed. Today, we're essentially reaffirming what we told you then with two updates. We expect Welding to be better at 5% to 6% organic growth for the year, offset by marginally lower growth than what we projected in December for Specialty.","Our segments with the strongest growth in the Q1, that includes Test & Measurement\/Electronics, Welding, and Construction are solidly on track toward their full-year targets. While global auto builds in Q1 came in modestly below expectations, they're forecast to turn positive year-over- year going forward, starting with builds up 5% globally in the second quarter. Food Equipment will also show positive growth as comps ease throughout the year. Polymers and Specialty are also expected to improve as we go through the year based on current levels of demand.","So while we may have some wider variation than usual in terms of segment growth rates in Q1, our overall growth guidance is unchanged, which illustrates the resiliency of our diversified high-quality portfolio. As I said, we remain firmly on track and expect organic growth of 3% to 4% this year, with all segments contributing positive year-over-year growth.","Now let's look at the segment details, starting with Automotive, our largest segment. Organic growth was 1%, while global auto builds were down 1%, as I mentioned. We continue to grow our content per vehicle and, as a result, our Automotive OEM segment again grew faster than global builds. Note that we continue to see excellent penetration in China also, with organic sales are up 8% versus builds down 3%. Forecast for global auto production were just revised up slightly and are expected to be up 2% in 2018. Given the visibility that we have to above market growth of 2 to 4 percentage points in this segment, we expect another strong year overall for our Auto business, with full year organic growth of 4% to 5%.","Let's move on to chart number 6. Food Equipment organic revenue was up less than 1% in Q1. On the positive side, we saw a nice recovery in our largest end markets, as institutional sales and chain restaurants in North America were up 7% in the quarter. However, this was offset by a decline in the retail sector, primarily grocery stores. The international side and the service business are pretty stable. And like I said, comparisons will get easier from here and the segment will benefit from new products being rolled out, and we expect to grow 2% to 3% in Food Equipment this year.","Test & Measurement\/Electronics organic revenue was up very strong, 8%. Instron revenue was up double digits and as we pointed out last quarter, their performance is closely tied to the business investment cycle and that continued to play out this quarter. Electronics was up 5%, with strong demand across the board, including semiconductor end markets. Strong performance as operating margin improved by 340 basis points to 23.4%.","Now chart number 7, Welding's organic growth rate continues to accelerate and the backlog is strong. Organic growth was 8%, with global equipment up 10% and consumables up 4%. North America was up 9%, with 15% organic growth in industrial, with strong demand in heavy equipment, ship, rail, and automotive. Oil and gas was strong, too, and accelerating in North America, up 9% and only down slightly on the international side. Margin at 27.7% was the highest in the company. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was less than 1% and our operating margin improved 30 basis points to 20.9% and margin improved despite material cost inflation tied to chemicals and resins.","Now moving to our last two segments on chart number 8, Construction continued its solid growth pattern into this quarter with 3% organic growth. North America was particularly strong at 7%, with residential construction at 9%. International markets were about flat. Specialty organic growth can be lumpy and was up 1% following a strong organic growth rate of 5% in Q4 last year.","Equipment sales, which represent about 20% of this segment, were up 8%, offset by a 1% decline in consumables. Overall, as Scott said, a solid start to the year. The positive underlying demand trends across our segments and our clear line-of-sight to margin expansion give us confidence that we will deliver top tier performance again in 2018.","Our updated guidance incorporates Q1 results, favorability from current foreign exchange rates, a modestly lower share count, and better operational performance. As a result, for the full year, we are raising our guidance midpoint by $0.15. We now expect full-year 2018 earnings in the range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share, up from a range of $7.45 to $7.65, which represents 17% EPS growth at the midpoint. We expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year, enterprise initiatives impact of 100 basis points independent of volume, and an effective tax rate of 24.5% to 25.5%.","As you can see from the graphic on the left side of the page, we expect an operating margin of 25% to 25.5%. That number is unchanged in terms of guidance. And after-tax return on invested capital of 27% to 28%. Our guidance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of known tariffs, material inflation, and our implemented price actions, and we believe that the price\/cost equation is manageable.","These efforts, coupled with volume leverage and the continuous strong execution of our enterprise initiatives, gives us the confidence that ITW operating margins will expand by more than 100 basis points, with margin improvement in every segment ranging from 80 basis points to 130 basis points for the full year.","Free cash conversion is expected to be 100% of net income or better. And, as I mentioned earlier, we have already repatriated more than $1 billion to the U.S. and repurchased shares for $500 million in the quarter. As a reminder, subject to board approval in August, we plan to significantly raise our dividend as we increased ITW's dividend payout ratio to 50% of free cash flow.","Finally, we're providing guidance for Q2, a range of $1.90 to $2 per share, which reflects 15% growth at the midpoint versus $1.69 in Q2 2017. And we expect organic growth of 3% to 4% in the second quarter based on current run rates, as every segment's organic growth rate is projected to improve in Q2 relative to Q1.","So just to wrap up, we continue to see solid demand trends across our businesses. We're well-positioned to deliver strong margin expansion. Price\/cost is manageable. We're raising our EPS guidance for the full year by $0.15 at the midpoint, which represents 17% year-over-year growth, reflecting our solid start to the year and our confidence in ITW's ability to continue to execute at a high level through the balance of 2018.","Karen, back to you.","Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Michael. So, Angela, let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin a question-and-answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. The first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So I want to start first on the operating margins, on segment margins specifically. So the segment margins were up about 40 basis points this quarter on a year-over-year basis, but there hasn't been any change to your operating margin guidance for the year. So my question is, how much of that improvement is coming from, like, lower corporate versus you expect to see an improvement on the year-over-year segment margins as we progress through the year and what's driving that?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","So, Joe, we expect every segment to improve operating margin for the full year, like I said, ranging from 80 basis points to 130 basis points. And the biggest driver there is the continued execution on the enterprise initiatives, as well as volume leverage, as all of our businesses are going to grow on a year-over-year basis. What you're seeing in Q1 is primarily the impact of price\/cost in these segments and the lag we've talked about in the past from when the material cost inflation shows up and the price actions actually are realized.","And so that's the 50 basis points of price\/cost headwind that you saw here in the first quarter at the enterprise level, which, as I said, we expect Q2 to look similar, and then we would expect it to get better from there through the second half of the year, again, as these price actions take hold and offset the known material cost inflation as we sit here today.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Michael, maybe focusing on price\/cost for a second, specifically as it relates to Welding. The Welding margins were flat year-over-year. One of your large competitors talked about getting some pretty significant pricing increases this quarter. Probably that hasn't flowed through results yet. Talk to me a little bit about the operational leverage in that specific segment. Just given growth is better, pricing seems to be pretty disciplined.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think what you are seeing, Joe, is similar to what I just described, which is this lag between when the price actions that have been announced, and there have been a number, as you know, offset the inflation that we're seeing primarily on steel on the Welding side. Again, I'll just point to Welding operating at 27.7% operating margin, the highest inside of the company, and we expect to continue to expand margins from here based on what we know today.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And maybe one last one. Just shifting to growth a little bit and focusing specifically on Auto OEM. You've got a pretty decent ramp on the organic growth side to hit your full year number. Just maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 this is one area where you have a little bit more visibility than some of your other segments. Maybe talk about what your expectation is based on wins you already have as you progress through the year.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think things were a little softer from the standpoint of global builds in Q1 than it looked like they were going to be in Q4, but certainly as we've moved through Q1, the build picture in terms of input from our customers and some of the public data that you can see, builds for the balance of the year has firmed up. As Michael talked about in his commentary, second quarter builds are projected to be up 5%. That's usually a pretty reliable number, given the timing. And then through the balance of the year, things seem to be firming up. I would also point out \u2013 I think I saw this today. Maybe it was GM that reported some pretty good sales. So I think things are firming up there demand-wise and the overall production scenario, as we look through the balance of the year, is pretty solid.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Scott and Michael, I know you just talked about Auto OEM, but maybe you could step back and tell us what you saw as the core evolved here and also here in April. You guys aren't alone, but I think at the beginning of the quarter we kind of thought that you might get closer to your high end for the year and through the 4% organic guidance. And then you had a couple of businesses, specifically Specialty Products, maybe Polymers & Fluids, which slowed down a bit, but you got your longer cycle CapEx businesses continuing to improve.","And I know that speaks to ITW's balance, but when you look going forward, is it going to be more of these longer cycle businesses carrying the torch here? And I know you changed your forecast a little bit for Welding \u2013 for Specialty Products, but is there a chance that Welding continues to outperform and maybe that's what sort of balances out, and Specialty Products is a little slower?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, Andy, the delta in Q1 was what Scott just talked about, on a global basis the forecast that we use, and we talked about this in the past put our guidance together, projected a 1% increase in global builds for Q1 and ended up at being down 1%. If you look at specifically North America, which is our largest end markets and highest concentration for vehicle, North America builds were down 3%. And, as Scott said, if you read some of the headlines, I think March was probably a little bit lower than what people expected. That number goes from down 3% projected to be up 3% in Q2, and overall North America expects to be positive for the year, which is quite an improvement from last year.","So we fully expect Auto to deliver 4% to 5% organic growth. We have really good visibility to the content per vehicle growth that gets us from the auto build number to 4% to 5%. In addition to that, you're right, continued strong momentum and acceleration on the Welding side. We have it pegged at 5% to 6%. Hopefully, that will turn out to be a conservative number. And then Test & Measurement, as well as the equipment side within Specialty Products, continue to be really strong in terms of order intake and the backlog for the rest of the year.","You talk about FEG. FEG should improve from here as the comps get easier, but there's also a nice product \u2013 new product rollout cadence here for the balance of the year. And so other than retail, which has kind of put a little bit of pressure on the growth in Food this year, we feel very good overall about growth rates improving from Q1 through the balance of the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And, Mike, I wanted to ask you about the guidance increase in the context of, obviously, you beat in the quarter $0.05 versus the middle of the range and, obviously, a little bit lower tax rate. Maybe if you can give us a little more color on the rest of the guidance increase. You talked about currency. You got a lower share count, but you also mentioned a better operating environment and you talked specifically about projects that ITW has. So if I look at the balance of the year, is this just more blocking and tackling? I remember you had some contingency in for this year, maybe on $0.15. Are you using some of that to raise the guidance?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Just for the record, I don't recognize the $0.15 you're talking about, but the $0.15 guidance increase today is basically the $0.05 beat from Q1. Like we always do at this point, we update our assumptions for current foreign exchange rates. We have a slightly lower share count, given some of the acceleration here in Q1, and in the plan we still have $1 billion for the year for share repurchases. And then the balance in that $0.05 to $0.10 is really better demand and stronger operations, so that's what's driving the $0.15 raise today.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. The contingency was around price versus cost, Michael. You had talked about it. You guys were pretty conservative at the Analyst Day. Just wondering what happened to that. It's getting absorbed with the higher material cost.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","We're using that up given the cost environment.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, if you look at relative to December, I mean, that's one of the variables that's changed, right? So price\/cost maybe there was an assumption would be more favorable and maybe a more conservative view today, so.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Good morning.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a couple of questions. Just on food and beverage, I mean, I think you said institutional and chain restaurants up 7%, which seems like a pretty big number, given the environment. So how sustainable is that? What do you think is going on there? Is that your new products getting good reception, or is it CapEx picking up, or is it a timing issue?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. It's really CapEx and stronger demand on the institutional side, I think education specifically. And then on the restaurant side, quick service was also very strong. So that's certainly -- if you look at the core equipment business inside of \u2013 core food service equipment inside of the Food Equipment business, we were up 7% in the quarter, which is certainly encouraging. And those trends look good for the balance of the year with good orders and backlog, and now you have the new product rollouts coming in as well.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And clearly you seem pretty positive on your ability to offset the higher input costs with pricing. Can you shed any light on what you're actually assuming in your forecast for steel? Do you just sort of mark-to-market where we are now to the balance of the year? Are you forecasting things to come down at all in the second half?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. We'll leave the forecasting to other people. We're basically taking what we're seeing in our businesses today in terms of inflation on steel, chemicals, resins, as well as the demand picture. And all of that is included into our guidance today. So...","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Just to clarify, that's already absorbed and also announced, so there are certainly things out there that we're not seeing the full impact of yet, but we've already accounted for those in the guide, and likewise have taken pricing actions on those. But it is all based on known. No forecast.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Correct. Yeah, there's no forecast.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And then just lastly, M&A, can you comment on the pipeline at all and likelihood of maybe at least some smaller-to-midsize deals this year?","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No. We remain very focused on executing our current strategy, getting our businesses up to full potential from an operational perspective. And we've talked about a long-time accelerating organic growth, and so that remains the focus. It doesn't preclude anything that might come our way opportunistically, but we don't have a particularly active agenda right now in that regard.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","If you could just talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in Europe across your broad portfolio, I'd appreciate it. There's some questions out there about PMI slowing, particularly in Germany. The strength of the euro, whether that's beginning to hurt it. Just curious with your breadth of portfolio, what you guys are seeing in Europe specifically.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","We haven't seen any slowdown. We were up a little bit less in the first quarter due to a tough comp. In the first quarter last year we were up 6% in Europe. We're up 1% here in the first quarter, but for the full year we expect to be up in that 3% to 4% range in Europe, and we haven't really seen anything slow down at this point.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Based on sequential run rates.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Right, that's based on current levels of demand. That's right.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. And then, can you just talk about \u2013 when you talk about price increases, I just want to be clear, are all your businesses implementing price increases as opposed to surcharges? And should we consider backlogs not included or dates when price increases will specifically be implemented? I just want to get a sense of \u2013 I know you talked about Q2 being similar to Q1,but if you could just talk us through the details, that would be great.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. These are primarily price increases and, as you know, we are not a backlog-driven company, so our businesses tend to be fairly short-cycle, and so these will go into effect relatively quickly.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","But we do have notification provisions and other elements in terms of how we transact with our customers that are all applied here. We're not breaking those. We're not trying to waive anything in terms of surcharges. I think it's the part of your question, Ann. So there is some cycle in terms of timing and working our way through it.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any particular segments where it might be more difficult to get pricing in this environment, or are customers broadly acceptant of price increases, which...","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I think everybody gets it, and I think we're having price discussions everywhere across the company. As you know, Automotive can be a little bit more challenging, but we're working through that with our customers as well.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just a quick clarification on Automotive. Are you more leveraged or less leveraged to cars versus SUVs, or is there anything in the mix that's changing out there in the industry that we should consider going into maybe next year? Maybe not this year, but Ford made the big announcement yesterday about cutting back on cars.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Our highest content, Ann, is on SUVs and trucks.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Good morning. You mentioned in the second quarter each business segment would have faster organic growth than the first quarter. And I was just curious. The comp does get easier for second quarter and third quarter. Are the businesses \u2013 or which businesses do you actually feel are truly accelerating and how much is it just simply the comp eases the next two quarters?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I mean, these are all based on current levels of demand, current run rates, so not \u2013 other than Automotive, which we talked about. So we're not counting on an acceleration. So what you're seeing, David, is the comps easier, as you point out, in Q2 and Q3, and then a little bit more challenging in Q4.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. And the demand environment is pretty good. I mean, order books are good. I think some of these quarter-to-quarter comparisons, there's so much that goes on that's sort of just circumstantial. And I think there can be a little bit of an over-indexing on a particular quarter-to-quarter comp, but I think from a sequential demand standpoint, the overall environment right now is firm to improving.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Yeah. I guess we're trying to figure is, is it truly improving, is it just the comp, and I appreciate the way you try to guide, just current rates, but trying to be a little more thoughtful about actual trends, not just current rate run forward. Maybe to ask another way, if you look at the first quarter organic for each business segment, then you put it up against the full year guide, there's obviously some that are in a lot better shape and other ones that are definitely dragging behind the full year. Can you just maybe quick rattle through the segments, where are the ones that you feel, yeah, maybe that one's a little hard to get to the low end, and that's another one that, sure, the way we're running now, maybe a better chance at the higher end? Just to give us a little play on maybe we're running ahead, we're running behind.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, I think the obvious ones to point to are the CapEx-related businesses that we've certainly seen some really good acceleration in Welding, Test & Measurement, and even the equipment side of Specialty. I think that part \u2013 if you were looking for where there might be some additional upside, it all depends. I think we've gone through \u2013 my perspective on that is two-and-a-half or three years of pretty tamped down business investment, so there is some fair amount of pent-up demand there. And the momentum in terms of order rate seem to be pretty good. I think the rest of them \u2013 the consumable business order rates are not bad. They're certainly not as cyclical as the CapEx parts of the portfolio. But I can't think of any place where we're seeing \u2013 we've got concerns going forward about whether we're going to generate a reasonable amount of growth, given the consumable demand...","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Yeah. I think the interplay is that those CapEx businesses are running at 7.5% plus in the first quarter. You'd like to think there's a chance they can do better than the 4% to 5% in Test & Measurement and 5% and 6% in Welding. And they usually bring decent incrementals. At the same time, Polymers, actually I'm scratching my head a little bit why we started that slowly. I mean, that's at 0.3% and the full-year guide's 2.5%. Food full year guide's 2.5%. We started at 0.4%. But those business don't have quite the same incrementals usually, at least as a base case. So we just kind of do the interplay of what's above, what's below, and so \u2013 okay, so nothing stands out in particular.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. We interact with the leaders of all seven of our businesses every quarter. So I think the overall picture that I would give you is everybody's feeling pretty good about the balance of the year from a demand standpoint.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","So none of them were thinking of taking down the full year guide on the organic. Let me \u2013 said more blatantly, there wasn't any heavy discussion on Polymers or Food to take it down or...","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","That's correct, other than the adjustment in Specialty we made. Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Yeah, the Specialty tweak. Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Back to the price\/cost a little bit here. You guys are saying you're going to have a headwind here in 2Q and you think it will flatten out in 3Q. I know you're not guiding for any more raw material inflation, but we are continuing to see raw material inflation. I'm wondering why you're not maybe taking a little bit more conservative approach to the back half or at least the third quarter on the price\/cost dynamic.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, what we're telling you, Nathan, is what we really think is going to happen here based on the actions that we've taken and the raw material inflation that we've seen so far. So Q2 we expect \u2013 let's do the margin impact first \u2013 to look a lot like Q1, and then a little bit better than that in the back half of the year.","Let me just point out, again, like dollar-for-dollar we are positive on price\/cost. So there's no negative EPS impact here from what we're seeing. So we were positive in Q1. We expect to be positive in Q2 in terms of price\/cost dollars. And if you extrapolate from what I said, we'd expect to be even more positive than that in Q3 and Q4 based on the price increases that we've announced, so.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And, I guess, that then leads to the 110 basis points of sourcing savings that you got this quarter. Are there actions you can take on the sourcing front to accelerate the savings out of that? Are there other initiatives that you can accelerate to reduce the cost to try and further offset some of this inflation we're seeing out there in the market?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No. I mean, that's not what we're trying to do here. Let me just clarify a few things. So the 110 basis points that you're referring to, like I said in my remarks, is a combination of two enterprise initiatives, one around our 80\/20 Front to Back Process, and the other one around projects, more strategic sourcing, structural savings that have nothing to do with price costs.","And the point that we were trying to make is that if you were to include those more structural cost savings from a sourcing perspective in the price\/cost equation, we would actually be positive. Now, that's not the way we report it. Other people may have reported that way, and so just for comparison purposes to make it easier we broke it out for you this quarter. But we are feeling very good about what we're doing here in terms of price\/cost, and we're reporting EPS up 23%, up 17% for the year. There's no need to overreact and do a lot more than what we're doing today.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","From a price\/cost perspective.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","From a price cost standpoint, so.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Quick one on tax. You repatriated the $1 billion. You're talking about repatriating another $1 billion. The $1 billion in the first quarter led to a tax credit. Is it possible you could get further tax credits for that? Was that specific to one country that maybe you brought cash back from? And then, I think, the guilty tax was one of the things you were waiting for clarification on. Have you got anything on that yet or still waiting?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, there's no clarification on the so-called guilty tax. In terms of further repatriation, what happened in Q1 was very specific to where those funds came from. It's possible that there might be further discrete items as we go through the year, but that's all encompassed in the guidance that we're giving you today in terms of our tax rate and the midpoint of 25%. So that's what I would use for your model.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Andy, good morning.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to first go back to David's question on the organic guidance, and specifically on Polymers & Fluids. I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on what's driving the organic reacceleration moving from flat to the 2% to 3%, because the back half comps look a little more challenging than, let's say, the second quarter. Is that all pricing?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","That is a part of it. The other part is there is some seasonality related to the Automotive aftermarket business, and so that business was flat in the quarter, and typically based on historical run rates, including seasonal trends, we see an improvement in the Automotive aftermarket business.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Michael. And then if I could ask a little bit of a longer term question, stepping back from the quarter. In between the Investor Day and now you've had the tax reform change. Does that impact how you look at the longer-term total annual shareholder return at all?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I'd say the obvious one is the lower tax rate, obviously, is contributing 5 percentage points of EPS growth. So in terms of earnings growth and the associated cash that comes with that, that's certainly a positive. I think there's a broader question around being able to access global cash more easily on a go-forward basis. That certainly strengthens our balance sheet and provides more cash available in the U.S., including distribution to shareholders and then what you saw when we talked about in December, and then the plans that we accelerated last quarter around the significant increase in our dividend payout ratio from currently about 43% of free cash flow to 50% of free cash flow. You do the math on that, that's a sizable dividend increase that's coming subject to board approval in August. So those are just a couple of the big items here, but overall...","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Doesn't change the core strategy in terms of where we're going with the business nor how we allocate capital.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Right. Strategically, yeah, that's right, there's no change. There's certainly a lot of positives for shareholders.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. I guess two follow-up questions. One, some other industrial companies have pointed to increased labor costs or supplier constraints, sort of inefficiencies in the channel. Are you seeing any of that and has that impacted earnings in the quarter?","And then my second question relates to, you highlighted the issue with auto build in the first quarter for your segment, but did any of that indirectly impact the weaker Auto? Did any of that indirectly impact the other segments? Because I do know you have some auto exposure in some of the other segments outside of Auto specifically. Thanks.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. So on the second, nothing material that I could think of in terms of any bleed over from Auto into the other segments. And then from the standpoint of your first question, we are not experiencing any supply constraints. We're certainly keeping a closer eye on that, but from the standpoint of where we are today, we seem to be managing through that well. And I think the other question...","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","The labor cost.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're \u2013 other than our normal annual pay raises, I think we're right in line with where we expected to be on that at this point.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question is from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","A lot has already been asked, so I just wondered if you could spend a minute going through some of the pieces of the construction market. Just trying to get a sense of if there's any inflection point or anything changing from interest rates rising.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, we really haven't seen \u2013 we continue to see strong growth on the residential side, which includes our renovation\/remodel business up in the high single digits, and looks really good for the balance of the year. Then the commercial side continues to be a little more lumpy and kind of flattish, and really no change in trend in either one of those.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then is there any way that you could give us more specifically in the $0.15 guidance increase, how much is from tax rate and lower share count or you just want to leave that fuzzy?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I'd rather leave it the way I said it. But basically the way I think about it is $0.05 is the Q1 beat, which certainly tax played a role. And then the balance is really a combination of currency is a little bit better, the share count is a little bit lower, you can do the math on that. It's the acceleration into Q1 of another $250 million, and the balance is really from the operating side and the confidence that we have that our teams will continue to execute on their plans for the year.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. That's great. Thank you very much.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","On your Auto business, just wondering how you're thinking about the gap between your growth rate and the market over the next year or so. You are out-growing by 3 points in Q4. This quarter was about 2 points. I imagine there's probably some normal quarter-to-quarter variation there, but just wanted to see if you have any particular expectations about that degree of outgrowth over the next year or so.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, and nothing's really changed. Steve, I mean, it's an area, as you know, inside the company where we have great visibility to above-market growth. Historically, we've been in that 2 to 4 percentage point range. It can be. It can vary a little bit on a quarterly basis. For the year, we're saying 4% to 5% organic growth in automotive builds. Globally it's supposed to \u2013 expected to be up 2%. And that's really how we think about this on a long-term basis for the foreseeable future. Given the orders we took two\/three years ago or longer, we expect to outgrow the market by 2 to 4 percentage points, so that hasn't changed.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","And the new programs we have in the pipeline, which is significant.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Right.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then I wonder if you could just make sure I'm thinking about this correctly on your operating margin improvement expected during the year. I think you're looking for about 150 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year for the full year. And it sounds like Q2 is going to be similar to the 90 basis points you had in the first quarter, if I heard that correctly. And then, does that mean, though, with the price lag that you are anticipating benefiting you in the second half, you're looking for close to 200 basis points or so in the second half? Is that the right way to think about it?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, not quite. So what I can tell you is that, Q1 is probably the low point in terms of operating margins. So typically, margins will go up in Q2 and Q3 from Q1. In terms of the enterprise initiatives, they come in on a pretty even 100 basis points a quarter. If you look at the organic growth guidance, we should get a decent volume leverage again Q2, Q3, Q4. And then we talk about price\/cost and how that might change as we go through the year. And so those are the big pieces here that get you to the overall expected margin improvement, which, as you say, is more than 100 basis points for the full year.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So the acceleration, though, for the 90 basis points will be more in the second half than it is in the second quarter?","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","All-in, yes, because of price\/cost.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. The drag on price\/cost will be less in the second half than in the first half, all else \u2013 based on what we know today.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I'll follow-up. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hoping to just ask a follow-on on the Food Equipment segment, and you called out the QSR business picking up. So it seems like after the last year or so that's a little bit of an inflection. I wonder if you could provide some color. Was it from international markets that picked up, or was it to the general market, or was it large QSR chains? Where did the business start to pick up?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","That's a domestic number.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. But was it to the general market do you think, or was it to the larger chains?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","So we typically don't break that out. I'm not sure I have that right in front of me. We typically don't do a lot with the really big players here for a number of reasons.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","In terms of chains.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","In terms of chains, but quick serve overall was up double-digit for us in the quarter.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. In this segment, foreign currency was a pretty big impact to the reported revenue number. Are you doing exports out of the U.S. or why is foreign currency such a...","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, the differences are really some businesses have more overseas sales than others. Food Equipment has, as you know, a big business overseas, and so they are seeing a little bit more impact than Welding, for example, which is where 80% of the business is North America.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And if I could switch over to Electronics, the organic growth really strong here, but you kept the organic guide at 4% to 5%. Is there a lumpiness to this business? And, I guess, thinking about it in the light of some volatility in semiconductors this quarter and Samsung calling out some consumer electronics weakness, how you're thinking about second quarter and the back half?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. No, orders and backlog look really good here. You just run into some tougher comps particularly in Q4 in that business, but there's nothing to suggest that on a run rate basis things are slowing down.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay, great. And the margin pickup, that's 80\/20 related and volume leverage?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","That's right, yeah. Really strong execution on the initiatives, and then combined with the volume leverage.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay, great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Good morning. I want to go back to these pricing questions, follow-up on that. I know you have a pretty short cycle business, but I'm wondering how quickly and how often can you change pricing through the year, how many bites of the apple, if you would. And is there any way to differentiate between your segments vis-\u00e0-vis your flexibility in changing price in a given year?","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","There's no structural impediment. I think the environment is \u2013 I think Michael said it this way earlier. I think everybody knows it's pretty apparent if you are in a product that's using silicones or steel or a number of other commodities, there are some significant changes in input cost. I don't think there's any impediments. I would also point out that we are operating now only in spaces where the product performance really matters to the customer. So I think these are all actionable and reasonable actions to take from the perspective of not only our investors, but I would say from the marketplace and our customers.","The issue is really, from the standpoint of some of the short-term impacts are really related to timing. We have relationships with a number of our customers, where we've agreed to either 60-day or 90-day. And I'm summarizing, Mig, over hundreds of different markets and customers, but there are things that we have to go through to implement these things that are just part of the process.","But again, when we're talking about overall margins up 90 basis points in this kind of environment, I think the sum total of the enterprise initiatives, our ability to recover cost dollar-for-dollar, I think we're in good shape here. Based on what we know today baked into our guidance, we're pretty comfortable in terms of what we've got in there around price\/cost. And if there are some additional downstream increases in costs that occur, we certainly have the ability to respond to those as they arise. And again, it'll have in some cases a similar month or two lag, but ultimately nothing that would present any sort of big game changing structural barriers to continue to perform the way we are expecting to perform this year.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I see. Really, the nature of my question was when I was thinking about this issue with other companies in my coverage, what I've heard is, hey, I can increase prices maybe once, twice a year, and if there is a mismatch in the meantime, I really have to work on the cost side. And I didn't know if that's kind of how you guys operated as well, and maybe this price\/cost guidance that you provided contained a maybe more meaningful cost management on your part to address this than is fully appreciated at this point.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it's a tough question to answer, Mig, because what we're talking about here is the roll-up from 85 divisions and hundreds of end markets and thousands of customers and pricing decisions being made. I think based on that roll-up and based on our strategy, we're very comfortable with where we're at on price\/cost for the year and we'll be able to respond if things change, so.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","But we're not limited to only two a year or something like that.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our last question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question on the international Welding side and seeing some stabilization maybe there. Is that a reflection of stabilization primarily in offshore? And with that, I mean, any confidence building that the bottom is kind of in there?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","As you know, I mean, the bulk of our international business is oil and gas, and it's certainly encouraging after a pretty significant down cycle here that the business is starting to stabilize and we're not calling the bottom, but it certainly feels better than it has in prior quarters.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","But it's not just offshore. It's oil and gas related more broadly. So I don't...","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Right.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I don't have in front of me what the offshore piece was specifically in the quarter, so I don't know that we can...","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Maybe a specific comment, but maybe you can follow-up with Karen.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then on Specialty, with the guidance, it looks like the lower organic growth in the quarter was more a blip and that you get right back on track. Any additional details around what was happening on the consumables side of the business within the quarter?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, the business can be lumpy. I mean, we've seen this before. If you look at Q4, the business was up 5%, and then up 1% here in Q1. We can point to couple of specific things internally that should get better from here based on run rates and backlogs, but that's probably as much as I can give you. As you know, marginally we tweak the organic growth rate for the segment a little bit, but there's nothing really specific to point to.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And just last one for you on pricing and timing sensitivity here. Was pricing raised during the first quarter , or is it that those letters have gone out? Over the course of the second quarter, prices are going up, so you get partial realization, and then back half the anticipation of full realization?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","All of the above.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Okay.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Some of all, yeah.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Appreciate it. Lots of business. All right. Thanks a lot.","Michael M.

Good morning and welcome to ITW's Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. ","During today's call, we\u2019ll discuss third quarter financial results and provide an update on our 2019 full year outlook. ","Slide two is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the remainder of 2019, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. ","Please note that this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. ","Please turn to slide three. Today we are announcing the date and location for ITW's next Investor Day. We hope you can join us on Friday, March 13 in Fort Worth, Texas at which time will provide an update on our long term strategy and offer a tour of our Traulsen, Refrigeration Plant site and the opportunity to see the ITW business model in action. Today's announcement is strictly a save-the-date alert and will provide more details on the event, including how to sign up for it when the date gets closer. ","So now we\u2019ll move on to slide four, and it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. ","Scott Santi ","Thank you, Karen and good morning. While slowing CapEx investment and declines in auto production in North America and China impacted the demand environment across a broad cross section of our portfolio, we delivered another solid quarter with excellent operational execution. ","Despite the macro challenges, we delivered earnings per share growth, operating margin of 25%, and a 12% increase in free cash flow. Despite lower volumes, we improved operating margin 40 basis points year-over-year with enterprise initiatives contributing 120 basis points and increased after-tax return on invested capital by 120 basis points to more than 29%. ","Looking ahead at the balance of the year, based on demand rates and our margin performance exiting Q3, we are maintaining our full year 2019 EPS guidance range of $7.55 to $7.85, while acknowledging that the combination of near-term macro uncertainties and the lingering strike at General Motors likely skews the probabilities of potential outcomes toward the lower end of the range. ","Moving forward, we continue to focus on executing at a high level on the things that are within our control in the context of the near term macro uncertainties, while remaining fully invested in driving progress on a Finish-the-Job enterprise ready strategy agenda, and on positioning the company to deliver on our 2023 enterprise performance goals. ","Our demonstrated ability to deliver strong results across a range of economic scenarios while continuing to make consistent progress towards our long-term full potential performance is a direct result of the combination of the performance power and resilience of the ITW business model and a dedicated team of ITW professionals around the world who leverage it to serve our customers and execute our strategy with excellence day-in and day-out. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael for some more details on our Q3 results. Michael? ","Michael Larsen ","Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, organic revenue declined 1.7% year-over-year as demand slowed modestly across our portfolio. This quarter had one extra shipping day, so on the same-day basis organic revenue was down 3.2% versus the 2.8% decline in Q2. Product Line Simplification was 60 basis points. ","By geography, North America was down 2% and International was down 1%. Europe declined 2%, while Asia Pacific was up 2%. On a positive note, organic growth in China was plus 7%. ","Our execution on the elements within our control was strong as we expanded operating margins by 40 basis points to 25% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and positive price cost. Our Q3 decremental margin was 15%. ","GAAP EPS of $2.04 benefited from the fact that we filed our federal tax return and reduced our estimated tax liability for tax year 2018 by $21 million, which contributed $0.07 of EPS in the quarter. ","On a year-over-year basis the $2.04 GAAP EPS number included $0.05 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact, which was offset by a $0.05 benefit from our lower Q3 tax rate of 21.6% as compared to 23.7% in the prior year. ","As expected free cash flow was strong at $830 million, an increase of 12% with the conversion of 126%. We repurchased $375 million out of our shares and raised our annual dividend by 7%. Overall, excellent operational execution and solid financial performance despite some external challenges. ","Let\u2019s move to slide five and operating margin. As you can see from the chart, operating margin improved again this quarter with enterprise initiatives contributing 120 basis points, which was the highest level since 2017. It is worth noting that the enterprise initiatives impact is broad based across all seven segments ranging from 80 basis to 190 basis points, and we're seeing the benefits of the accelerated restructuring activities we initiated earlier in the year. ","Price remains solid and well ahead of raw material inflation on a dollar basis. In addition, raw material cost pressures eased again this quarter, and price\/cost margin impact was positive for the first time since 2016. Volume leverage was unfavorable 40 basis points, and other was 60 basis points of headwind, about half of which was from normal, annual inflation on wages and salaries, coupled with some one-time items. Restructuring expense was equal to what we spent in the third quarter 2018. So, in summary, strong operating margin performance again this quarter. ","Turning to slide six for details on segment performance. The table on the left provides some color on organic grow. As you can see, on an equal day basis, we were down 3% in Q3, which was essentially the same decline as in Q2. ","Like Q2, we experienced lower levels of demand in some of the CapEx related offerings. You can see the impact in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, and Electronics, both with growth rates 4 points lower than last quarter. However, in both cases, underlying order rates were pretty good. Automotive OEM was down less in Q3, largely due to the benefit from an easier comparison year-over-year, and the Welding and the remaining three segments were all pretty stable. ","Now let\u2019s move to individual segment results starting with Automotive OEM. Organic revenue was down 2%, as the GM strike reduced revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. In addition, we had 100 basis points of PLS impact. North America was down 6%, Europe was essentially flat, and China organic growth was 7% in a market where builds were down significantly. Margins of 22.1% increase 60 basis points year-over-year. ","Moving on to slide seven. Food Equipment organic revenue was down 1% despite strong performance in our service business, which was up 3%. In North America, demand for equipment was a little slower in retail, restaurants were about flat, and we continue to experience growth on the institutional side despite a pretty difficult comparison. ","Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor. Test & Measurement and Electronics was a little softer this quarter as organic revenue declined 3%. Test and Measurement was down 4%. Excluding sales to semiconductor equipment manufacturers, organic growth would have been up 1%. Electronics was down 3%, mostly driven by softness in electronic assembly. Operating margin nevertheless expanded 90 basis points to 25.6% with enterprise initiatives also a main driver here.","Turning to slide eight. Welding organic revenue declined 2% against the tough comparison of 10% growth last year. In North American the equipment side was down 4%, but against the comp of more than 10% growth last year. North America consumables were up 4%, which continues to point to pretty good underlying Welding activity at our customers. International is now 3% and operating margin was 28.2%. ","Polymers & Fluids organic growth was up 3% with Polymers up 7% against the comparison of down 3% last year. Automotive aftermarket was up 2% and Fluids was down 1%. Operating margin was up 200 basis points, driven primarily by enterprise initiative. ","Moving to slide nine, construction organic revenue was down 1% with continued risk in Australia and New Zealand which was down 4%. Europe was up 1% and North America was essentially flat with residential remodel however up 4%, offset by lower demand in commercial construction. ","In Specialty, organic revenue was down 5% and similar to Q2 the main drivers were 100 basis points of the PLS impact and the relative performance of the businesses we've identified as potential divestitures. These potential divestitures reduce organic growth for the segment by about a point and half; in other words core specialty was down 3.5%. By geography international was down 5% and North America was down 4%. ","Let's talk about full year guidance on slide 10. Based on demand rates and our margin performance exiting Q3, we are maintaining our full year 2019 EPS guidance range of $7.55 to $7.85, while acknowledging as Scott said, that the combination of near term macro uncertainty and the lingering strike at General Motors likely skews the probabilities of potential outcomes towards the lower end of the range. ","While the Q3 discrete tax items that I described earlier, lowers our full year tax rate to approximately 24%. This benefit is essentially offset by incremental foreign currency headwind that has crept in since we updated our full year guidance as of the end of Q2. ","We expect that operating margin for the full year would be approximately 24%, which is down slightly from our previous guidance as a result of higher accelerated restructuring expense and the impact of slightly lower volume. It is worth noting that given the environment, we now expect incremental accelerated restructuring expenses in Q4 that will represent a headwind of approximately $0.03 year-over-year.","Our cash performance has been strong all year and we expect that our full year conversion rate will be well ahead of net income. Our plan in terms of share repurchases remains unchanged and we are on track to repurchase approximately 1.5 billion of our own shares this year. ","Now for a quick update on our portfolio management activities. Overall our various divestiture processes are on track. As a reminder, we're looking to divest certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion and are targeting to complete this effort by year end 2020 with about half of the divestitures in 2019. ","The positive impact includes about 50 basis point improvement in our organic growth rate and approximately 100 basis points of margin improvement. Not counting potential gains on sale and the EPS dilution will be offset by incremental sherry purchases and we will continue to provide you with updates on our regular earnings calls. ","Finally as a result of moving our annual Investor Day to March, we will now provide 2020 full year guidance, part of our January 2020 earnings call. ","With that, Karen I\u2019ll turn it back to you. ","Karen Fletcher","Okay, thanks Michael. Julianne, please open up the lines for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ann Duignan from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning everyone. ","Scott Santi","Good morning! ","Ann Duignan","Good morning. Maybe we could start out with more color on end markets and what you saw as you went through the quarter in terms of cadence of sales or cadence of orders by segment. If you don't mind, just some color as to what's going on beyond the General Motors strike? I appreciate it. ","Scott Santi","Yeah, sure Ann. So I think there's really nothing yet unusual on a monthly basis as we went through the quarter. I think as we talked about in the script, we did see a modest slowdown, particularly on the CapEx side here in Q3 similar to what we saw in Q2, and you saw it show up to some extent in Food Equipment as well as in Test and Measurement where the growth rates were lower in Q3 relative to Q2 on a year-over-year basis. ","You know that said, I also think it was worth pointing out that when we look at the underlying activity in these businesses and the order rates, they are actually looking pretty good heading into Q4, so a little bit of a mixed bag here. ","I\u2019d say automotive looks like on a year-over-year basis, certainly the Q3 organic growth rate was better than Q2. Part of that is an easier comparison, and then obviously we talked about the impact of the GM strike here in Q3, so \u2013 and the remaining segments, pretty stable, you know Welding, Construction, and Specialty. ","Ann Duignan","And just a follow-up on maybe some color on the Welding side consumables versus equipment. I mean, I think you had flagged back in Q2 as the CapEx side slowing, but the consumable side still strong, and I think in your comments you reiterated that. Could you just update us on if there was any change in that industry?","Scott Santi","Yeah, so I was just talking about North America which is really 80% of our business. You know, we did see some softness on the equipment side, down 4%, but keep in mind the comp from last year, equipment was up 11% in Q3 last year. Consumables, up 4% \u2013 I think we were up 8% in consumables here in the second quarter. So, a little bit of \u2013 maybe a little bit of a slow down on the consumables side, but overall North America down 1%, and I think we\u2019ve said Welding is pretty stable here in Q3 similar to what we saw maybe in the second quarter. ","Ann Duignan","Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there in the interest of time. I appreciate the color. Thanks. ","Scott Santi","Thank you, Ann. ","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","John Inch","Yeah, thank you. Good morning everybody. ","Scott Santi","Good morning. ","John Inch","Good morning. The GM strike, is that \u2013 are you guys assuming that the GM strike does not get resolved in the fourth quarter as part of your guidance. It may not move the needle perhaps, but \u2013 and then when it actually ends Michael, that 1% drag, does it flip to a 1% contribution or because there has to be inventory fill back at the company, right in terms of working process, does that actually go up higher than the 1%. How are you thinking about it? ","Scott Santi","Well, I would say that all the scenarios, all the potential scenarios from it gets settled. I guess next week with the Board [ph], all the way through that never gets settled through the quarter are embedded in our guidance range. You know there is \u2013 we have really no purpose or advantage in trying to make a particular bet. We are obviously not involved in the process, but have incorporated all the \u2013 you know sort of the most optimistic and the most pessimistic scenarios in our guidance range for the balance of the year and essentially that's how we are approaching it. And since you asked Michael, and I\u2019ll give you a little color in terms of the potential impact on the organic growth of the company. ","Michael Larsen","Yeah, I think here in Q4, as Scott said kind of best case at this point is, we start back up next week. So we\u2019ve already lost a month, which is almost a full point of organic growth at the ITW level, about 3 percentage points of impact in the auto segment alone, so that's essentially done at this point. And then if you can you kind of, as Scott said, if things do not get resolved at all this quarter, which is maybe the worst case scenario, we would lose another [multiple speakers].","Scott Santi","That is the worst case scenario. ","Michael Larsen","Which is the worst case scenario. You know we\u2019d lose another 2 points of organic growth here. So those things are kind of all embedded in what we're talking about today, and I think it's part of the elements that you know skew our view in terms of the guidance range towards the lower end as we talked about it. ","John Inch","Okay. So in other words, if the worst case scenario GM doesn't get resolved until Jan 1, the low end of your range for the year, the $7.55 still captures that, that's what you're saying? ","Michael Larsen","Yes. I mean I think, obviously we don\u2019t want to get into customer profitability, but in terms of you know EPS, we're talking about pennies of impact here. ","John Inch","No, that's fine. Just for my follow up, Scott I remember historically how your enterprise initiatives and PLS, you were fairly adamant this was going to lead to kind of a structural elevation in ITW's organic growth, and you guys have been at this obviously for years; and it's been very, very successful. Here we are in the third quarter and PLS is kind of sort of at the same cadence, right, 60 basis points; it was 70 last quarter; enterprise initiatives is actually accelerating. ","I'm just wondering, I mean presumably you would've gone after kind of the lower-hanging PLS fruit. Is there a risk that as we keep this PLS cadence off that, you know the future for with respect to organic growth and what you had thought would be the benefits from this somehow gets impacted because this PLS just doesn't abate if that makes any sense, and maybe growth has an impact down the road. ","Scott Santi","Well, I think the \u2013 I don't see it as a risk. I think really what we are seeing play out is that the PLS rate has definitely come down over this, you know the period that we\u2019ve been implementing it. ","John Inch","Right. ","Scott Santi","If you remember back to the front end of the implementation of the strategy, it was running 1 point to 1.5 points. ","You know, we feel like on an ongoing basis just embedded in how we operate the business model normalized, I think we even talked about this at last Investor Day; normalized PLS should be 30 to 40 bps, so at 60 I don't think we are too far from, you know we're not \u2013 we're certainly demonstrating the movement through that process certainly, and as you suggested, the low hanging fruit we dealt with a few years ago, but there's certainly some fine tuning going on. ","A lot of that in those businesses that we're still working on, getting position to grow, we\u2019ll give you an update at the Investor Day in terms of how we're tracking on the rate of growing versus not growing divisions, but I assure you we are making solid progress on that front, and we\u2019ll as I said, give you a fulsome updates in March, on Friday the 13th. ","John Inch","Yes, Friday the 13th. So you're feeling good about the prospective core growth once \u2013 as a result of I guess the PLS and EI, which I presume we're going to see more of once we get rid of these, you know these companies still slated for divestiture. ","Scott Santi","Yeah, there is no question. I'm not \u2013 you know the macro environment certainly right now would offset some of the online [ph] progress, but we are on it from the standpoint of the qualitative steps we need to take to accelerate organic growth. That has continued unabated through this process. It's certainly a little more difficult to see in terms of growth rate, the yield on all that effort given the environment right now, but you know we have \u2013 I assure you we are making really solid progress and it remains the number one focus of everything we're doing. ","John Inch","Many thanks. ","Scott Santi","You bet. ","Michael Larsen","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Jamie Cook ","Good morning. The margin performance I guess, if you think about the second quarter and the third quarter, I guess even in first quarter you faced I guess some more challenging organic growth that\u2019s been fairly depressed. And then if you think about, you know the margin performance in the fourth quarter and while it\u2019s good, it's still implying sort of you know more of a step function down and the inability to I guess keep the margins up year-over-year I guess which is expected, but to some degree can you just provide some context on the degradation in Q4 margins and just what that implies for 2020 in terms of how we think about detrimental margins for Q2, Q3 elevated more so because the price cost. I'm just trying to understand the step function change there. ","And then just my second question \u2013 I guess my second question is we all debate, you know whether how this market plays out in terms of sort of mid-cycle slowdown versus you know more challenging concerns, recessions and how you guys are familiar managing your business. Thank you. ","Michael Larsen","Why don\u2019t I take the easy one, which is the first part, then maybe we'll take a stab together on the second piece. ","I mean I think we've tweaked our full year margin guidance as you noticed, really to account for two things. One is that just given the demand environment that we're in, we made a decision to further accelerate some restructuring projects and so we are going to be spending more on restructuring for the full year. And these are really projects that were in the pipeline for next year and so we've pulled them forward into this year, so that's a portion of it. ","And then the other piece is really you know we talked about GM impact and just kind of the macro environment and the potential impact on volume leverage, so really those two things combined. ","I will tell you that at the same time when I look at the \u2013 you know we'll give you kind of a squiggle, 24%. I mean we're really talking about decimal points here, so I wouldn't read too much into, you know certainly into the implications for next year. Our ability to continue to expand margins, nothing has changed from that perspective. ","So hopefully that makes you feel a little bit better about the margin assumptions here and then the second question I think was really in terms of how things play out from here, from a macro standpoint and\u2026","Scott Santi","You\u2019re looking at me. ","Michael Larsen","I\u2019m looking at Scott here for some wisdom. ","Scott Santi","Well, I guess I don\u2019t want this to be interpreted wrong, but I have none. I think our view, you know fundamentally in terms of how we operate the company is we are going to operate, we are going to react and we are going to operate to the best of our ability and whatever the external environment throws our way. I think we've built \u2013 spent six or seven years now building a highly competitive, very effective company that now has the kind of margin cushion underneath it that allows us to react to whatever the world throws at us. ","I think you're all well aware of some of the issues right now and that they relate largely to a lot of uncertainty that\u2019s out in the environment for reasons that you are I'm sure all well aware of. ","I think whatever \u2013 you know however that gets resolved, this company is well positioned to operate at a very high level on an absolute and a relative basis in that environment and given some of what we\u2019ve talked about historically in terms of flexible cost structure, in terms of margin and profitability that we will continue to focus on operating the company in the most appropriate way for whatever the environment is that we find ourselves. Personally I'm optimistic, but who knows. ","Jamie Cook ","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll let someone else get in. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities, your line is open. ","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning! ","Scott Santi","Good morning. ","Andy Casey","Within welding, could you provide a little bit more color in the U.S.? did you see any significant differences in performance by main market? ","Scott Santi","So not really Andy. It was pretty similar in North America to what we saw in Q2, I think characterized a little by some stability is maybe a way to describe it. I think if you look at you know the industrial businesses, down and low single digits, so that's more on the heavy equipment side. ","The commercial business flat, maybe down a point or so and an underlying that like I said so the equipment side down four, offset by consumables up four, so we end up basically flat. Maybe I'll give you one more data point here. You know the oil and gas side was actually slightly positive, not a big part of the business in North America, but up mid-single digits in Q3, so \u2013 but really a stable quarter in terms of welding. ","Andy Casey","Okay, thank you. And then when you look forward in the Q4, you called out that $0.03 of accelerative restructuring. Is that concentrated in any few segments or is that kind of similar to what we've been seeing the placement during the year. ","Scott Santi","Yeah, it's very similar. I mean if you look at, there\u2019s a schedule in the appendix of the press release that lays out kind of the \u2013 this is pretty broad based and you know as I said, I can give some points out. These are projects that were planned all along for 2020 and we're going to try to accelerate some of those into the Q4 just as a result of this, kind of the demand environment that we're seeing. ","Andy Casey","But they are related much more directly to enterprise initiatives than\u2026 ","Scott Santi","That is correct. I think if you want to make a distinction, I think the first half of this year there was a focus certainly around acquisition integration on the automotive side. We accelerated some projects there just give the environment that in hindsight turned out to be you know a good decision and you know this time around it's more enterprise initiative 80\/20 related projects that were you know scheduled for 2020 that we're going to pull forward into 2019. ","Andy Casey","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","Scott Santi","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","David Raso","Hi, good morning. ","Scott Santi","Good morning. ","David Raso","A quick clarification on the fourth quarter of the margin. With the implied sales and the implied EPS, which is about $1.94 or so to hit your mid-point, it does seem to require the operating margin to be you know nearly 25%, call it 24.8%, 24.9%, something like that. So are we saying there's a step down in the margins in the fourth quarter and if so, is the fourth quarter helped by below the line items to hit the EPS? I'm just trying to level, is that the fourth quarter view. ","Michael Larsen","Yes, so this is a little tricky Dave, because we don't give Q4 guidance, we're giving you a full year number. What I will tell you is, as you go back and look at historical margins, typically take a step down here in Q4 relative to Q3, like I said, here we talked about restructuring, we talked about lower volume, you could model what the impact might be from that, and then there's no \u2013 we're not counting on any one time item one way or another in terms of the fourth quarter. So hopefully that's helpful without giving you specific guidance for the quarter. ","David Raso","I appreciate that, but obviously if you take the mid-point you can't have a margin that's like 24.2% or 24.3% or whatever it may be and still hit your EPS number, unless you do get help below the line. So there's a little bit of a mismatch in the numbers and we can discuss offline. ","The inventory management I thought was pretty good during the quarter. That's a first time in a few years your inventory performed better year-over-year than your sales, meaning they were down a lot more than sales were down. The incremental restructuring in the fourth quarter, the way you're handling the inventory, you know it does seem likely at least you\u2019re doing the right thing so to speak for maybe a slower \u201820. ","Can you help us a bit with the inventory, how you view it in your channel? You know obviously your own inventory as I just said sort of did a pretty good job sequentially year-over-year. Can you help us with the channel inventory color? ","Scott Santi","Well, I think from the standpoint of channel inventory and we talked about this before, but we are \u2013 given the performance embedded in, let\u2019s call it the operational X, you know elements of 80-20, you know we are you know for 90% plus of what we sell. You give us an order today, we ship it tomorrow. ","So from the standpoint of channel inventory, I think that's an advantage and from the standpoint of our channel partners in terms of minimizing their need to carry a lot of inventory, so you know I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why we tend to have these external market inflection one way or the other show up in our business quicker than maybe some others where there's more backlog involved. ","I think that's a real advantage, but you know I don't think we're going to talk about destocking or any of that stuff, because I don't really think it's an issue from our standpoint given the relatively low level of them toward that are \u2013 I mean there are some out there certainly, but it's not a material element given the way we\u2019re able to service our channel partners.","David Raso","So that's interesting. You're saying the improvement in the inventory management, 2Q to 3Q that we normally say again year-over-year, that was just normal course a business. You would say that was not any proactive\u2026","A - Scott Santi","Right. That \u2013 we\u2019re not getting into a lot of detail. That\u2019s just \u2013 there's a self-correcting element to demand found where you know all that stuff is. We\u2019ve talked about this before and we\u2019ll show it to you in Fort Worth a little bit when we visit there, but essentially we are producing today what our customers bought yesterday. So there's no forward forecasting in our raw material replenishment. It's all basically replenishment from vendors, so it\u2019s essentially self-correcting to the demand environment, which is the reflection and what showed up or what you are looking at. ","David Raso","Right. Well, lastly \u2013 thank you. The portfolio management, that half of the asset sales are still hope to be done by the end of this year. Can you just give us an update on \u2013 you know we're only few months away. Is it a matter of the right partners, is it you know still discussing the price? Just to make sure we\u2019re comfortable and we still see some of those asset sales done by the end of this year. Thank you.","Scott Santi","Yeah, it's a little bit of all of the above. I mean I think these processes are all in various stages. In terms of negotiations and you know I think we've talked about our goal is to get half of these transactions completed this year and all of them completed by the end of next year. ","I'll say in terms of overall financial impact, you know there may be some one-time gains on sale that I'm sure you know we're going to call those out and you can adjust our EPS numbers based on that. I think fundamentally from a financial standpoint as we look forward, this is to 2020, the EBITDA that we are divesting here, that will essentially be offset by lower share account. So from an EPS standpoint there really is no significant impact on the company. ","And then structurally when all of these are completed by 2020, which is certainly our goal, you know structurally there's an element here of addition by subtraction as we've talked about. That's the 50 basis points of improvement in the organic growth rate and 100 basis points of improvement in our underlying operating margins. ","David Raso","Right, thank you. ","Scott Santi","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Joseph Ritchie ","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. ","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Joseph Ritchie ","So maybe asking David's question a little bit differently, I know you don't want to give an explicit guide for 4Q, but if we think about the full year guidance of 24% at the operating margin level, it implies that 4Q is going to be down year-over-year, you know call it roughly 50 to 60 basis points, and I'm trying to understand the moving pieces. So I recognize restructuring has now been increased to the fourth quarter, but there is also a $0.05 benefit from what I remember coming through in 4Q as well. And so maybe you can just kind of help me with the moving pieces year-over-year. ","A - Michael Larsen","Yeah, I mean Joe. I'm not sure I can add much more to what I said previously. I mean we've given you the elements here, you're right. I mean higher restructuring we talked about, you know there's an assumption of lower volume, which includes and you know we talked about extensively the GM impact. And then certainly we expect to see you know enterprise initiatives continue to contribute at a high level and price cost trends are positive. So I think those are kind of the pieces here. ","Again, you know like I said, this is a \u2013 things are in the round here. We're talking about decimal points of differences and you know I wouldn't get too caught up in kind of the Q4 versus full year margin number. I think for the full year, in a pretty challenging year you know margins are essentially flat. ","If you take out the restructuring, margins are improving year-over-year which is the Q3. 40 basis points a margin improvement, detrimental margins of 15% and so I think the company is performing at a pretty high level just given the environment that we're in, so\u2026","Scott Santi","And I\u2019ll just extent that. I know we should \u2013 in any way interpreting this is the same. We are not fully on track to take in our margins to where we think we can on a long term basis by 2023, right. ","Joseph Ritchie ","Okay, and maybe I\u2019m going to follow-on that question and Scott, as you kind of think about the moving pieces, I know you're going to give explicit guidance at the Analyst Day in March. But as you kind of think about the moving pieces, you know obviously commodities have become a little bit more of a tailwind for a lot of industrial companies, your price costs only turned positive, which is great. But there's also been additional investment spending that has been a bit more of a drag on the overall margin in recent years and so maybe you can provide a little bit more of a bridge for next year and how we should be thinking about the different moving pieces as you guys see it. ","A - Scott Santi","Well, I don't know that I can give you a lever. In terms of specifics we're going to give you our guidance. As Michael said in January, we haven't even completed the planning process yet. We do that typically in November, so all I can tell you from the standpoint of moving pieces is for sure we have a backlog of enterprise initiative projects. We expect continued margin improvement structurally from those next year. ","I can't exactly dimension it for you yet, because we haven\u2019t gone through the planning process, but I would say it would be you know my \u2013 sitting here today that would be \u2013 it would be in line with what we did this year, which is a full point or so give or take.","You know and the other big question for next year is going to be where does the volume go in terms of the macro. This is a company that's really well set up. In terms of leverage if we can get some volume growth going from the standpoint of end markets, but if we see further deceleration in 2020, then we'll, you know we\u2019ll react to it. I think we'll operate well either way and then these divestitures will as Michael said, add a full point of margin performance as we work through those and complete those by the end of next year. ","So I think from the standpoint of the overall margin profile of the company and you know the clarity of our path to where we said we were going to get 2023, I don't see anything that\u2019s also becoming an obstacle to that for sure. ","Joseph Ritchie ","Okay, thanks for your time. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open. ","Stephen Volkmann ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Michael, I think you sort of talked about this already, but you're not looking at any meaningful changes in things like PLS, enterprise initiatives, price cost, etcetera for the fourth quarter, that's not part of the equation here? Hello?","Operator","We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stay on the line. ","And you're now reconnected. ","Stephen Volkmann ","Hi guys, can you hear me? ","Karen Fletcher","Yes, sorry we lost the connection in our room, so you'll have to start from the beginning. Sorry about that. ","Stephen Volkmann ","Okay, good. I don't think it was my fault, I didn't touch anything. ","A - Scott Santi","I think Joe didn\u2019t like the last question. [Cross Talk]","Stephen Volkmann ","Yeah sorry, this is Steve with Jeffrey. So I just had a couple of quick follow-ups and the first one Michael, I think you kind of touched on this stuff, but I just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t forecasting any meaningful changes in the cadence of things like PLS, enterprise initiatives, price cost in the fourth quarter to kind of explain a little bit of that shift. ","Michael Larsen","Yeah, that's correct, yeah we're not \u2013 that\u2019s not what we're talking about. ","Stephen Volkmann ","Okay, great. And then this is maybe a slightly annoying question, but assuming you get 50% of your divestitures done by the end of this year, does that mean that 50% or 50 basis points of even improvement sort of flows into 2020 or are you potentially kind of working on the bigger return projects first and it might be a little higher or perhaps lower even, I don't know. ","A - Michael Larsen","Yeah, I mean directionally, I'd say about half of the impact. If everything \u2013 theoretically if everything gets done by year-end 2019, so like let\u2019s say everything \u2013 half of the projects that we're working on, they all get done by year-end, you will see approximately half of the benefit that I mentioned earlier in 2020, and then when everything is complete as they were targeting by the end of 2020, so 2021 will be the first year where you would see a full 50 basis points of organic growth and 100 basis points of structural margin improvement, so hopefully that\u2019s clear. ","Stephen Volkmann ","Yeah, very clear. Thank you so much, I'll pass it on. ","Michael Larsen","And then any EPS impact will be \u2013 you know the goal is to completely offset that so we shouldn't see anything from any EPS standpoint. ","Stephen Volkmann ","Got it, thank you.","A - Scott Santi","Yeah, some one-time gains that would flow through, yes. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Vlad Bystricky from Citi. Your line is open.","Vlad Bystricky","Good morning, everyone. ","A - Scott Santi","Good morning.","Vlad Bystricky","So just going back to the segments here for a minute, you gave obviously some good color around the GM issues in North America. But if I look at auto OEM, you actually had pretty nice rebound in organic there internationally. So can you give us more color on what's really going on in Europe and especially in China where the out performance versus builds you know really widened this quarter? ","A - Scott Santi","Yes, so I think in Europe we talked about I think in the last call, things appearing to begin to stabilize in Europe and so we've gone from being down kind of mid to high single digits to you know now flat as builds have recovered as well in Europe, so. ","And then China was really the big outperformance there as really as a result of continued penetration gains, primarily with local Chinese OEM's. So even in a market where builds are down kind of in the mid-single digits here in Q3, we\u2019re able to outperform and grow our business you know 7%. So it's nothing new. It's really a continuation of the strategy that we've been pursuing there for many years, so. ","Vlad Bystricky","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just stepping back bigger picture, at the last analyst day you categorized the divisions into three groups that you've talked about a bit; ready to grow and growing versus ready to grow and not yet growing versus long term challenge. Now that we've had a bit of a hick-up in the macro, can you give us some more color on how each of those three groups of businesses have been performing through the current slowdown and whether you're seeing anything that changes how you may be thinking about the longer term outlook for any of the particular businesses. ","Scott Santi","We haven't seen anything that changes our view of both the potential from the standpoint of growth in any of those businesses and also in terms of the agenda and the things we need to do to get them to deliver growth to that full potential. We\u2019ll give you guys a really good update, I promise, when we meet in March, in terms of exactly how those different types of businesses performed, even through this period where there\u2019s some macro pressure. ","Vlad Bystricky","Okay, that's helpful thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue. ","Scott Santi","Alright, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks guys. Good morning.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","I apologize. I'm going to go back to well-trodden ground here. There\u2019s a lot of confusion about your \u2013 what the message is on Q4 margin, and if we take what you said, which is point us towards the lower end of the range, for obviously, one understands the reasons, it does point to a so 24% margin for 4Q. ","So we've got a higher structure, it\u2019s about 30 basis points based on the $0.03 impact. Is it just simply lower volume? I'm asking this in a sort of track to clear out some confusion out there. This could be lower volume in Q4 of the business Q3 with some GM impacts in some of that. But just \u2013 if you just could clarify that point that would be very helpful. ","Scott Santi","Yes, so two things Nigel. So let me recap what I said earlier, maybe say it a little more clearly. So one is typical seasonality if you go back and look, our orders, our margin rates go down from Q3 to Q4 because of the volume goes down, so that\u2019s one piece here. ","The second piece is higher restructuring on a year-over-year basis, and then the third piece is lower volume, and so including the potential GM impact that we quantified earlier. ","So it's really those three elements that are you know factored into the overall equation and our overall guidance, and even with those elements, you know within EPS, within organic growth guidance and that we treat the margins for the full year really to reflect everything I just talked about. And again, we're talking about decimal points on rounding\u2019s here. ","Nigel Coe ","That's great, that's very helpful and then of course another fact would be that you typically managed down inventory from Q3 to Q4, so that\u2019s where you got some production currency there as well and you know to shut down especially in Europe. So I'm just curious, you did a great job of managing inventory, you know David Raso that you know earlier in the call. Are you planning to take another say $50 million to $100 million inventory out in Q4, just typically what you do? ","Scott Santi","It would \u2013 we don\u2019t have any forward plan to do that. As I said earlier, you know the system for us is essentially self-correcting to the level of demand that our businesses are experiencing week to week and so in a way I would say yes, because normally fourth quarter volumes dip from Q3 and therefore inventory and actually it follows that path. But it's more of a, just a way the 80-20 operating system operates. It\u2019s not a you know what, not to tell people to do it. ","Nigel Coe ","Yep, okay, well thanks. Hopefully that's the last Q4 margin question. Thanks a lot. ","Scott Santi","Alright, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open. ","Mig Dobre","Hi, good morning. I will not ask about the margin in the fourth quarter, but I will ask about your revenue guidance. Not sure if I missed this, but you reduced revenue by $300 million versus the prior guidance, call it a little over 2%. What were the moving pieces here in terms of FX, organic hit from GM macro? ","Scott Santi","Yeah, I mean the big difference is really you know the currency piece. So we have you know a more headway on the top line and on EPS relative to when we gave guidance in Q2, really as a result of foreign exchange rates moving against us here since July when we were on the last earnings call. ","Mig Dobre","Okay, so that\u2019s, it\u2019s all FX. ","Scott Santi","Yes. ","Mig Dobre","I see. And then my follow-up going into segments again, I'm looking at the welding business and to me it's pretty remarkable that your volumes have grown in North America in the quarter. Certainly that's not what I'm hearing when I'm talking to people in the industry and we all sort of see that some big customers, especially on the heavy equipment side are cutting production. ","So I'm kind of wondering why that's happening and what your hearing from your business operators there. Are you taking share, are there some other dynamics or is it simply that the environment is not as dire as we're all thinking and that may be the flipside applies to Food Equipment, which has slowed and I would think that that market is not as macro sensitive, maybe as welding as for instance. ","Scott Santi","Yes, so let me start with the welding. I mean in think we characterized it as a pretty stable and just to be clear, our organic growth rates, we don't break out volume versus price, right, so that may be part of \u2013 and I don't know what everybody else is saying at this point, but that may be part of the difference here on the welding side. ","You know Food Equipment, you know we did continue to see solid growth on the institutional side as we talked about restaurants flattish and then really the softness if you want in food was on the retail side and we can point to some specific orders that were pushed out to Q4 and so the underlying order rates on the food equipment side are pretty good. So that's how we tried to characterize it earlier. ","Mig Dobre","Alright, thank you. ","Scott Santi","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open. ","Walter Liptak","Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. ","Scott Santi","Good morning. ","Walter Liptak","Just a follow-on with the food equipment segment. The restaurants being flat, you know I think that was growing pretty rapidly for you guys in prior quarters and you called out some CapEx things as slowing. I wonder if you can just provide some more color about what you're seeing in that restaurant segment? ","Michael Larsen","Yeah, I mean I \u2013 all right, so we'll give you a little more detail here. In terms of the QSR side, fast casual actually showing continued to show really strong growth on a year-over-year basis and it's really more of kind of the full service, think like fine dining type that was a little bit slower here in the quarter. So net-net we ended up at about flat on the restaurant side. ","Walter Liptak","Okay, but what \u2013 but that flat I think was down from prior quarters. I think you guys were up high single digits in the first half. Was there something that slowed? ","Michael Larsen","I have to go back and look, I mean \u2013 and how comps played into that. I mean I think the best I can tell you is the description I just gave you. I think comps probably if you factor that in are the main driver, but we can follow up on that. ","Walter Liptak","Okay. All right, thank you guys. ","Scott Santi","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys.","Scott Santi","Good morning. ","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just a first question maybe to help level set on some of this price cost. Michael, I think if I look back historically, we're kind of in the zip code of where you know price cost is normally I guess kind of topped out in deflationary environments, kind of in this 20 maybe 30 basis point range. Is there something that kind of governs that system based on the mix of business from going higher or should we think about you know something in the zip code as kind of being historically more of high end than something that can go higher. ","Michael Larsen","No, I mean I think historically what we've \u2013 our goal has always been to just offset any material cost inflation with price, and you know that's what we've done so far this year. If you're asking whether things are going to accelerate from here in terms of the 20 basis points of price cost, I wouldn't make that assumption if that\u2019s your question. ","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, that's helpful. And then just a follow up, you know thinking about the auto side, but maybe more in Europe where we have some changes coming down the road on emissions and maybe some of the OEMs get a little pinched on mix next year. Have there been any discussions about any kind of mix changes or you know folks getting more, I guess you know kind of aggressive on pushing back on prices than usual just as a function of some of the margin challenges the OEMs will be going through next year. Thanks. ","Michael Larsen","So we haven't through any of the plans yet, but I would be very surprised if we heard somebody describe the environment the way you just did, so I think we\u2026 ","Scott Santi","I don't know how you can push back more.","Michael Larsen","It\u2019s a tough industry and in automotive you know our positioning has a very niche, value added solutions provider. You know it\u2019s fueled by innovation and thousands of patents, that\u2019s how we generate price in automotive, but the cost pressures will always remain and that hasn\u2019t changed and I'd be surprised if that would change on a go forward basis, so\u2026 ","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. Thanks, I\u2019ll leave it there. ","Scott Santi","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. ","Steven Fisher","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to clarify the non-residential construction versus the resi comments you made there, where you said resi was up and non-resi down. Can you just clarify was that specifically North America or more broadly, and then can you just give a little more color on what parts of the non-res market are driving that lower. ","Michael Larsen","So, like I said, this was a North American comment and the residential remodel side continues to be really solid and so that's where we experience 4% growth here in the quarter and that's really the \u2013 what we call the age of the business; that's the bulk of the business in North America. ","You know the commercial side can be a little lumpier. There\u2019s a project business in there. One of the products that we provided is we pour concrete floors for warehouses and data centers and some of those projects can move in and out of the quarter, and you know this quarter that business was down in the low to mid-teens and kind of offset into North American and ended up basically flat. ","Scott Santi","Let me just clarify, we make products that people use and they pour on those floors, we don\u2019t do that.","Michael Larsen","We don\u2019t pour it, we make the\u2026","Steven Fisher","Sure, understood. And then just related to the auto side of the business, how does your content per vehicle for 2020 look relative to 2019. I imagine at this point you have some view of that. Just kind of curious, what kind of growth you have in the bag already from a content perspective. ","Michael Larsen","Yeah, I mean the content as we talked about before is locked in for the next two to three years, so that\u2019s content growth. Obviously we don't know what the auto builds are going to be, but in terms of new product launches and content of new vehicles, the whole business is geared around you know 200 to 400 basis points of above market growth as a result of continued penetration gains. Obviously that number is higher in China as you saw this quarter again, and have seen for many years, but on average it's in that 200 basis to 400 basis range and that hasn\u2019t changed. ","Steven Fisher","Okay, thank you very much. ","A - Scott Santi","Sure. ","Operator","Your last question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open. ","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. ","Michael Larsen","Good morning. Sure.","Nathan Jones","Michael, you made a comment that I don't think anybody's asked you about, that the test and measurement in electronics orders were actually pretty good. I think that's probably a bit surprising given the soft CapEx environment. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what was driving that, whether you know there is just some timing impact there or it's more of a you know an improving trend you're seeing. ","Michael Larsen","Yeah, I mean I think as you look at the test and measurement business, so down 4% but up 1% excluding the semi-business. We've seen actually some \u2013 a couple of months here on the semi side from an order standpoint and then the electronics business is down really primarily driven by electronic assembly. And here similar to what we talked about early, we had some orders that we're differed from Q3 into Q4, and so\u2026 ","But the MRO side inside of electronics and more I think like clean room technology is pretty stable. But again, it's really more \u2013 so that the pressure is really more of the on the equipment side. But again order rates are somewhat encouraging as we head into Q4. If you look at historical, Q4 is always the biggest quarter for the test and measurement business. So that's probably as much color as I can give you. ","Nathan Jones","Okay, and I guess my follow-up question on enterprise initiatives, you guys are looking for a four point this year and four point next year. If I think back a couple years to your Analyst Day in 2017, I think you said 2018 would be a 100 basis points, 2019 will be like half that and then you thought the margin tailwind from enterprise initiatives would be over. Clearly you're out performing that, so maybe you just talk a little bit about, you know the kind of things you have found at a time to continue to drive that, and whether there's an expectation that you can continue to drive margin improvement out of EI past 2020. ","Michael Larsen","Well, I think that's a great question, and I think we\u2019ll be spending quite a bit of time on that at Investor Day. I mean I think part of what's going on here is 80-20 is \u2013 the core element here is that of continuous improvement and you know I think the more work we do in this area, the better we get at 80\/20, the better the raw material in terms of the underlying businesses, you know the more opportunity we find. ","And so if you recall all the way back to when we launched the enterprise strategy, the goal was to get to 20% EBIT margins. Today we are sitting in the mid-20s with a clear path to 28% in the not too distant future, and it's not that we knew all along, that's what we were going to end up with. It's really that we keep getting better and better at 80-20, and 80-20 today as our operating system is more powerful than it's ever been in his to the company and it continues to evolve. So you know I can't give you specifics in terms of basis points for next year yet, but we expect to continue to make progress consistent with what we've done over the last six years and I\u2019ll just want one more data point. ","If you look at, this is not one or two segments driving this. This is really broad based. I think we said between 80 and 190 basis points across the segments and so that gives me and should give you some confidence for sure that there's a lot more opportunity to come here from the margins standpoint, so\u2026 ","Nathan Jones","Very helpful. Thanks very much. ","Scott Santi","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","We have no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Karen Fletcher for closing remarks. ","Karen Fletcher ","Okay, thanks Julianne. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning and feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions. Thank you.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","And now I'll turn today's conference over to John Brooklier. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","John L. Brooklier","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me this morning is our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen.","During today's call, we will discuss our strong Q2 financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. As usual, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We have scheduled 1 hour for today's call.","Before we get to the quarterly data, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2014 third quarter and full year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2013 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that housekeeping taking place, I will turn the call over to Scott Santi, who will make some brief overview comments on the quarter. Scott?","E. Scott Santi","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter and with the continued progress we are making in executing our enterprise strategy in what continues to be a mixed environment.","Our operating margins in the quarter of 20.5% were up 300 basis points, and after-tax return on invested capital was also up 300 basis points to 19.5%, representing continued solid progress towards our enterprise performance goals of 20%-plus for each of these metrics by 2017. 6 of our 7 segments improved operating margins in the quarter, with strong performance across the board as enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points to overall margin improvement.","The environment continued to be mixed, and overall revenues were up 4% and organic revenue up 1.4%, lower than our Q1 growth rate, primarily due to more challenging comps internationally and lower auto builds.","In addition, ongoing product line and customer base simplification associated with the execution of our enterprise strategy reduced our organic growth by approximately 1 percentage point. There were some encouraging signs in North America as our Test & Measurement business and Welding business both grew 4%. For the first half of 2014, total revenues are up 4% and organic up 2.3%, both in line with the top line guidance we've been giving since December.","EPS of $1.21 was up 32% versus Q2 of last year, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. And as a result of performance year-to-date and our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year, we are narrowing and slightly raising our guidance range today. The new full year midpoint represents a 26% increase on a year-over-year basis.","In closing, I'd like to thank the ITW team for the strong performance and continued progress they've delivered in the quarter. In year 2 of our 5-year enterprise strategy, we are pleased with the progress so far and confident in our ability to deliver on our enterprise performance goals.","Now let me turn the call over to Michael Larsen, our CFO. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Okay. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 2.","Q2 was another quarter of strong operational execution, resulting in EPS of $1.21, an increase of 32% year-on-year. As you may recall, last year had a $0.05 nonrecurring pension settlement charge. So on an adjusted basis, EPS increased 25%.","The operating teams continue to execute well on their business structure simplification and sourcing efforts, delivering record operating margins of 20.5%, a 300-basis-points improvement over last year with 120 basis points of margin expansion from the enterprise initiatives.","Total revenues were $3.7 billion, up 4% versus prior year, with organic revenues up 1.4%, below our Q1 organic growth rate, primarily as a result of more difficult comps internationally. For the first half of 2014, our total revenues are up 4%, 2.3% organically, in line with the revenue guidance we've been giving since December of last year.","In the quarter, we essentially completed the portfolio management element of our 5-year enterprise strategy with the sale of the Industrial Packaging business and we're confident that our current portfolio of differentiated businesses is well positioned for growth with best-in-class margins and return on invested capital.","We also completed the share repurchase program related to Industrial Packaging by repurchasing 17 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total share repurchases to 50 million shares since the announcement in September of last year. Our ending diluted share count for Q2 is 400 million shares. And since September, we've spent $4 billion and repurchased 11% of our outstanding shares. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is $2.8 billion, and given the performance of the company and our outlook for 2014 and beyond, we fully expect to repurchase shares opportunistically in the second half of the year.","Free operating cash flow for the quarter was $0.5 billion and our conversion rate is tracking to be greater than 100% for the full year, in line with our previous guidance.","Finally, as you can see, our return on invested capital on an after-tax basis was 19.5%, an improvement of 300 basis points. In summary, the ITW team continue to make good progress on the enterprise strategy in a mixed environment, and we remain on track for a strong 2014, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","On Page 3, some more color on the organic growth rate for the quarter, with North America up 1%, with continued strength in Automotive, up 8%, and Food Equipment, up 4%. As Scott said, we were encouraged by our Welding segment and Test & Measurement business in North America, both up 4%. International growth was 2% in the second quarter compared to 6% in the first quarter, primarily due to tougher comps in Europe and South America.","Internationally, strength in Automotive and Test & Measurement and Electronics was partially offset by expected declines in Welding.","You can see, Europe up 1% in the quarter; South America down 5%; and Asia Pacific up 7%, as China and Australia performed well. In China, Automotive was up 22%, Food Equipment, up 14%; Polymers & Fluids, up 9%. Since we will be mentioning product line and customer base simplification, what we commonly refer to as PLS, a few times today, let me just spend a minute and put this core element of our 80\/20 management process in the context of our enterprise strategy.","An integral part of our 80\/20 process and our enterprise strategy is to focus on quality of revenue and not quantity. And through product line and customer base simplification, our segments are eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers and focusing their businesses on supporting and growing with their largest customers and product lines.","PLS is a core element of our 80\/20 management process and an integral component of our ability to achieve sustainable, best-in-class margins and returns going forward. In year 2 of our enterprise strategy, PLS is a natural and expected outgrowth of our business-structure simplification initiative as we now focus on reapplying ITW's proprietary 80\/20 management process to our 90 new larger-scale divisions.","We quantified the reduction on organic revenue to be approximately 1 percentage point, and we fully expect that focusing the company on taking full advantage of the considerable growth potential that resides within our largest customers and product lines will achieve improved overall organic growth performance over the medium and long term.","The financial impact of product line and customer base simplification continues to be fully captured in our guidance as we continue to expect total year revenues up 3% to 4% and organic revenues up 2% to 3% in what continues to be a mixed environment.","Moving on to Slide 4. Operating margins were a highlight this quarter, as solid execution across the board led to operating margins of 20.5%, an increase of 300 basis points from last year. 6 out of 7 segments expanded margins in a big way, many achieving the record levels of profitability, as Construction Products, Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, Specialty Products and Test & Measurement and Electronics all put up solid margin expansion numbers.","As you can see, businesses such as Polymers & Fluids and Construction are now approaching sustainable 20%-plus operating margins, levels that, frankly, seemed out of reach just a few years ago. In a sluggish environment, Welding essentially maintained their best-in-class 26% operating margin for the quarter.","On the right side of the page, we've listed the drivers, with 120 basis points from the continued progress on our enterprise initiatives, operating leverage of the top line growth was 40 basis points, and price\/cost was again a favorable 10 basis points. And with a few exceptions, the material cost environment remains benign. You can see the 130 basis points of margin favorability from other, which includes the nonrecurring pension settlement in the year-ago quarter.","With that, I'll be back in a few minutes to discuss the third quarter and updated 2014 guidance. But first, let me turn it over to John for some additional commentary on the segments. John?","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Michael. On Slide 5, you'll see a breakdown of total revenue and operating income per segment. And while Auto OEM and Food Equipment segments led the way in top line growth, 5 of our 7 segments produced double-digit growth and operating income. In particular, and as noted earlier, Construction Products and Auto OEM achieved operating income gains of 32% and 26%, respectively. You'll see further evidence of this as we highlight significant operating margin progress for nearly all of our segments.","Now I'll go into further detail on our operating segments. On the right-hand side of the page, in Auto OEM, the segment produced another outstanding quarter on multiple fronts. Organic revenues grew 8%, outpacing worldwide auto builds by 6 percentage points. By geography, organic revenues for Europe grew 9%; North America, 8%; and China was up 22%.","Our European businesses outperformed European auto builds by 7 percentage points, largely due to our fuel and powertrain product lines. In North America, we outpaced auto builds by 4 percentage points, thanks to our plastic fastener and powertrain products. And in China, we continued to gain share via multiple product lines outperforming auto builds by 11 percentage points.","The drop-through to the bottom line was very strong as segment margins of 23.7% were 310 basis points higher than the year-ago period. Great performance by Auto.","In our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment on Slide 6, organic revenues increased 1% in Q2. The good news is that we saw improvement in the Test & Measurement portion of the segment in the quarter. The T&M portion, their organic revenues grew 6%, thanks in large part to the strength from our flagship Instron business, which was up 8% in Q2. We're hopeful that the better performance in T&M and Instron is suggestive of a more sustained pickup of CapEx spending, and we're encouraged by order activity and backlog as we move into the third quarter.","In the Electronics piece of the business, organic revenues declined 3%, largely due to comps in the electronics assemblies business. We believe this category will improve as the year progresses. For the segment, operating margins of 15.2% were 150 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","Looking at Food Equipment. Segment organic revenue growth was 3% and largely reflected global contributions from its equipment and service businesses. In North America, equipment and service-related organic revenues grew 4% and 5%, respectively. Equipment's organic revenue growth was driven by an increase in the sales of refrigeration and cooking products. Internationally, equipment revenues increased 5%, thanks to a strong warewash and refrigeration sales. International service organic revenues declined 2% due, in part, to some weakness in France. And once again, the segment's operating margins of 19.5% improved with 80 basis points of improvement versus the prior year period.","Moving to Slide 7. In our Polymers & Fluids segment, organic revenues declined 3%, and that was largely attributable to our ongoing PLS activity. As Michael noted earlier in his PLS comments, we continue to weed out the less profitable products and customers in this and other segments. As a result, PLS has had the typical impact of decreasing organic revenues but improving margins. All 3 of our platforms, polymers, fluids & hygiene and auto aftermarket, posted declining organic revenues of 6%, 3% and 1%, respectively. The much better news is that segment operating margins moved up significantly to 19.6%, and that was 130 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","In the Welding segment, worldwide organic revenues declined 2% but that was largely due to specific international business, as well as some targeted PLS customer back activity. The international organic revenue decline of 15% was due to a convergence of events. In China, we were once again hit by comps related to the completion of the portfolio transition from a shipbuilding to an energy-infrastructure focus. We believe, however, that this comp will ease in the Q3 and beyond. We also experienced some delays in onshore pipeline projects in China.","In Europe, we implemented PLS activity in Germany, and our Middle East business was negatively impacted by political events in the region. The much better news came from North America. And as Michael mentioned earlier, organic revenues increased 4% in the quarter. We saw some early signs of strengthening in equipment sales for both the industrial and commercial end markets and continued growth in the welding gun area. We also expect Welding to benefit from easier second half 2014 comps. And we'll remind you that the company-leading operating margins of 26.3%, while they were down 20 basis points, is still a very strong performance.","On Slide 8, we continue to be very pleased with the dramatically improving profitability metrics in our Construction Products segment despite some uneven organic revenue performance. Segment top line reflected geographic variability as Asia Pacific's organic revenues grew 8%, thanks to our residential and commercial construction growth in Australia and New Zealand. You'll recall, we also had good performance in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter.","Our North American Construction-related organic revenues declined 2% as our residential business was moderately negative, thanks in part to some ongoing PLS activity, while our renovation and commercial construction business showed modest growth. In Europe, organic revenues declined 4% as commercial construction activity was especially soft in France.","As we have consistently communicated with our investors, at this point in time, we are chiefly focused on improving the profit profile of this segment through both business structure simplification and PLS initiatives. We are clearly on the right path as Construction Products' operating margins of 18.2% were 450 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","And then finally, in our Specialty Products segment, organic revenues were flat as a pickup in a variety of our consumer packaging businesses, principally our film, gluing systems and apparel-related units, was offset by delays in projects for our warehouse automation products. Our appliance business grew organic revenues 1%, while our ground support organic revenues were flat. Strong segment operating margins of 24.2% were 180 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","Now let me turn the call back over to Michael, who will cover our 2014 and third quarter guidance. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen","Okay. Thanks, John. Our financial performance in the first half of '14 and the positive momentum on the enterprise initiatives gives us increased confidence in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments for 2014 and beyond.","For 2014, we're raising the EPS midpoint slightly and narrowing our full year EPS guidance range to $4.50 to $4.62, which compares to the previous range of $4.45 to $4.65. The new $4.56 midpoint represents an increase of 26% versus 2013 on unchanged total 3% to 4% revenue growth. As you can tell, we're not counting on a second half acceleration of revenues.","Our balance sheet and cash position is excellent and we fully expect to repurchase shares opportunistically in the second half of the year. At this point, we can't be more specific in terms of timing or magnitude, and we have not included any impact from lower share count in the updated guidance today.","With the month of July, the third quarter is off to a good start and we expect Q3 EPS to be in a range of $1.19 to $1.27, again with 3% to 4% total revenue growth and continued year-over-year margin expansion with approximately 100 basis points coming from our enterprise initiatives.","We're pleased with our first half financial performance with total revenues up 4%, operating margins of 19.6%, an improvement of 240 basis points, and EPS up 23%. In addition, following the completion of our portfolio management efforts, we now have 7 highly differentiated segments with significant growth potential going forward.","While much work is still ahead of us, 2014, the second year of our 5-year enterprise strategy, is shaping up to be a year of continued progress as the ITW team works hard to further expand margins and returns, and we continue to redeploy our strong cash flows in a disciplined and returns-focused manner.","In addition, we believe that many of the efforts that we're undertaking today are positioning the company for stronger organic growth in the future.","With that, let me turn the call back over to John.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Michael. We will now open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, Andrew Kaplowitz, Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Scott, so you've talked in the past about some of the bigger CapEx markets potentially coming back such as Test & Measurement and Welding. In 2Q, you did see some of that improvement. So do you think this is the inflection in sort of these large CapEx markets that we've been waiting for? And you did mention pretty good order visibility into 3Q, and that's despite ag being weak, which we know is part of the Welding business. So maybe you could talk about that.","E. Scott Santi","Yes. Andy, I don't think that we've seen enough to say it would be an inflection point by any stretch, particularly given the overall choppiness of the environment. I think we were generally pleased with, certainly, a noticeable pickup in the order rates in both businesses in North America. But I think we'd like to see another quarter or 2 before we call it an inflection, for sure.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, Scott, in terms of ag, are you worried about that affecting the Welding business a little more as you go forward in the second half?","E. Scott Santi","I don't think so. I think right now, we're -- I don't expect things to get a whole lot worse there. And again, the overall mix, ag represents 10%-ish of our revenues in North America. So I think we've got a nice mix of end-market exposure there that even if it did erode further, I don't think it's going to put us off our plan at all for the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just another big-picture question. Like business simplification through PLS is -- it's actually slowing down some of your businesses that you just talked about. But you've talked about how it eventually will accelerate organic growth. So the headwind that you mentioned was 1% in the quarter. When do you think that headwind will turn into a tailwind? Is that next year, end of this year? Like how should we look at that?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think it's a little early to tell. I think we'll have a little bit better view for you on '15 as we get to December and we've gone through our planning process. What I would say is it's in our plans for the next 2 quarters. As Michael said earlier, this is -- we are front and center on the reapplication of 80\/20 across our 90 scaled-up divisions and it's certainly a normal and expected part of the process. So what I can say for sure is for the next 2 quarters, we expect a similar sort of impact that's fully embedded in our guidance. And I think we need to get through our '15 planning process to have a better view internally and what we can share externally on how that ultimately impacts our overall performance in '15, if at all.","Operator","The next question from Deane Dray, Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So year 2 enterprise strategy and you're already bumping up on the operating margin, 20%, and the return on invested capital target. So is it time to start setting the bar higher? Should we be going some -- temper expectations for further improvement? But just help put us in context as you get there sooner than you thought.","E. Scott Santi","Well, what I would, I guess, sort of offer as a reminder is this is 1 quarter, not a full year. So I think what -- where we are sets us up certainly, for us to be able to at least hit those 2 metrics in '15 given the progress that we're making. And I think what I would say is we still have plenty of work to do across all of these initiatives. We are not done with BSS, not done with sourcing. So we would expect continued progress as we move forward. But it -- but we haven't sort of boxed the upper end at this point and we're really managing the company quarter-by-quarter, and ultimately, we'll talk about where we think we can get in '15 late this year.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Scott, I probably should've added a congratulations within that question because you did get there faster and those are impressive numbers. And then the second question is on capital allocation. So just in terms of how you've couched buybacks to be opportunistic, other uses of cash, maybe the M&A environment, the target has been 1\/3 of your revenue growth to come from M&A, but it's been pretty quiet there. So maybe put that in context for us, please.","Michael M. Larsen","Yes, Dean, so this is Michael here. So what I would start with is that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. As you know, we've been very disciplined and returns-focused. And we generate a significant amount of cash. And priority one is reinvesting in our businesses, whether those are CapEx projects or new products given our innovation efforts, as well as BSS or restructuring efforts. And so all of those projects are fully funded. The second priority is our dividend. We have a -- roughly a 2% dividend yield at this point. And the dividend continues to grow in line with our cash flows as -- and has done so for a little over 50 years. And we certainly view that as an important component of our capital allocation strategy. And so that leaves the balance, approximately 50% of our total cash flows, for we've -- what we've called external investments. And really, that encompasses acquisitions, which, under the right set of conditions and financial criteria, would take priority over share repurchases. Given where we're at in terms of the M&A environment and also given our strong balance sheet and cash position and our view of where the company is going to be, not just in 2014 but really as we continue to execute this 5-year strategy, we have a preference for repurchasing shares. And so that's what we alluded to in the second half of the year, is that we will -- rather than an announced program like the one we just completed for -- associated with the IPG divestiture, is an attempt to be more opportunistic as we go into the balance of the year and also, as we start to think about 2015 and putting together the plans for next year. So that's how I'd position it for you, Deane.","Operator","Next question, Jamie Cook, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Andrew on behalf of Jamie. Just a quick question on Construction. So you guys spoke about there's some -- still some uncertainty, I think, and some mixed commentary on housing and commercial construction. Would you guys say you're -- have changed your stance on this segment at all in terms of becoming more cautious of recovery? Or what's your view at this point, as it relates to how it was 6 months ago when the year started?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I don't think it's changed at all. I think what we've been saying for the last year for our business in the Construction or in our focus, that we had a business that had the potential to generate a significantly greater level of earnings at the current revenue base than what we have been performing to. So our focus for the last 4 to 6 quarters has largely been on getting our Construction business up to margins and profitability levels that we could see in terms of their potential. And I think that's been the focus. Our -- from the standpoint of top line and the market dynamics, right now, you all read what's going on there. It's pretty up and down. I think on a year-to-date basis, from an overall organic standpoint, we're largely tracking various industry metrics. We're not looking for a lot of out-performance there yet, because we are so focused on driving these internal improvements and we got a lot more work to do there, particularly in Europe, and we're on it. So I don't think our view has changed at all, other than I think we're on track, we're pleased with our progress and clearly, there is no sort of momentum right now on the ground in terms of any significant recovery building, particularly in the housing market in the U.S.","Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching to Food Equipment. Margins there were pretty impressive and are looking pretty good relative to historical levels. How sustainable do you think those are? Are there any initiatives underway? Or that you could talk about that you think you can get those -- you keep those margins at this -- at current levels or even go higher?","E. Scott Santi","I think they're very sustainable and would expect that as we continue to grow that business, given historical levels of incremental profitability, that we generate an organic growth, let alone the continued impact of some BSS and sourcing initiatives there, that we'll continue to move those margins up as we go forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question, John Inch, Deutsche Bank.","Karen K. Lau - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Karen Lau dialing in for John. So could you talk about the progression on the quarter? Some companies called out Europe fading and Latin America seems to be really soft, especially in June. Did you see any of that? And I guess, more importantly, did you see any of those geographic markets improve since the end of the quarter?","Michael M. Larsen","We didn't see any unusual trends as we went through the quarter. June was our best month, but it usually is. And so there was really nothing unusual. Europe, as you noted, was -- and South America, which is primarily Brazil for us, was weaker in the quarter. But weakness -- we didn't see increased weakness or strength as we went through the quarter. Like I mentioned, July for us is off to a good start and we feel good about the guidance we've given here for the third quarter and for the total year.","Karen K. Lau - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then on price costs, you realized 10 basis points in the first half. I believe you implemented some pricing increase, maybe towards the end of 1Q. Does -- did those price increases stick? And are you still expecting 20 to 30 basis points for the year?","Michael M. Larsen","Yes. So we -- as you mentioned, we did increase price in several of our segments and saw positive price in the majority of our segments. The 10 basis points is slightly below the 20 to 30 that we were expecting for the year, and we're probably going to be at the lower end of that range as we look at it today. Nothing structural. There's a little bit of FX impact here. But as I mentioned, the environment, in terms of direct material inflation, remains benign at this point, and the businesses are doing a good job taking advantage of price opportunities as we continue to add value to our customers. So that's how I'd describe it.","Operator","Next question, Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.","Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Jiayan filling in for Nigel. We just want to dig a little bit into SG&A. It has been pretty flat in the range of $680 million to $690 million for the past few quarters. So I wonder whether this is a good run rate going forward. And also, if we look at the sales under the G&A portion, how has the G&A expense been trending over the past few quarters? And what's your expectation there?","Michael M. Larsen","Yes. So if you look at SG&A this quarter, it was down $70 million on a year-over-year basis. About half of that is the pension charge that I mentioned in my comments. So approximately $35 million. And we did have slightly lower restructuring costs this quarter versus the same quarter last year. But beyond that, it's really continued good cost controls and discipline in our segments. And so with those caveats I just mentioned, I would think this quarter has a pretty good run rate on a go-forward basis. As a percentage of sales, 18.2%, and so we don't expect it to differ much from those levels. And actually, as we continue to implement our BSS efforts across the company, we should expect to see overheads come down. Like I said, as we exit smaller product lines and discontinuations with customers that -- and take out the overhead associated with that, you should expect to see overheads and SG&A to improve.","Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's really helpful. And another question for the 120 bps contribution from enterprise initiatives. Can you maybe just give us some color, what percentage of this is driven by the PLS and what percentage is driven by the other initiatives?","Michael M. Larsen","Yes. So we -- historically, we've not broken out the impact from the enterprise initiatives in much greater detail and we're not going to go down that path. And so the 120 basis points was really strong execution by the operating teams on our BSS efforts, as well as on the sourcing side.","Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So the PLS benefits, you're already seeing that during this quarter, right? So the -- all the things you are doing, you are already reaping the benefit. It's not like a benefit you're expecting to see in 2015.","Michael M. Larsen","Right. I mean, I think the benefit you're seeing now is the lower overhead costs and the improved mix of our product portfolio. What you don't see today is what we've talked about, which is as we focus on the larger product lines and customers, we fully expect that we will take advantage of the full organic growth potential with those customers and product lines. And so what we're doing is positioning the company for accelerated organic growth in the future. And that's -- so obviously, you have not -- in the short term, you're seeing the reduction in the revenues but you're not seeing the long -- medium- to long-term impact yet.","Operator","Our next question, Jim Krapfel, MorningStar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So you had a couple of quarters now of 120-basis-point margin benefit from your strategic initiatives. Just wondering what's the run rate of improvement you expect going forward here in the next couple of quarters. And at what point would you expect maybe some strategic sourcing benefits to max out? Would that be in kind -- end of 2015 or '16 period?","Michael M. Larsen","So to answer your question, I mean, we are expecting approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion from the initiatives in the third quarter, and again in the fourth quarter. And that's on a year-over-year basis. And that's what I just described as very consistent with the guidance that we've previously provided. And we have -- as we develop the plans for '15 and '16, we don't see any reduction in the sourcing savings. So we really continue those -- expect to see those continue as we go through at least through 2017, which is the fifth year of our enterprise strategy. So we're not seeing a decline in sourcing savings. If anything, we're probably seeing a little more of an improvement this year versus last year in year 2 of our strategic sourcing efforts.","Operator","Our next question, Walter Liptak, Global Hunter.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Let me ask about the Welding business, especially North America. The 4% organics looked a little bit better than we were expecting. Can you talk about how the quarter trended? And how things are doing in July?","E. Scott Santi","I don't know that we saw any major inflections month by month that was -- the improvement was in the capital equipment area, which, again, we thought was positive development, and also on guns. So it does speak to a little bit more investment by our Welding customers. But as I said earlier, it's basically a 1-quarter trend. So hopefully it will continue. We'll wait and see.","Michael M. Larsen","The only thing I'd add is we are -- if you look at the comps on a year-over-year basis, the comps do get easier here in the second half of the year. So on a year-over-year basis, we should be seeing improved growth rates out of the Welding business.","John L. Brooklier","Walter, I also add that we've talked about Welding before, and we specifically talked international, that the comps on the international side relative to this portfolio transition in China, we should start to see better comps than that as we move into third quarter and beyond. So I think that'll be helpful to the overall segment performance.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That sounds good. And if I can switch over to electronics assembly and the decline there. There are some new mobile devices coming out in the second half and -- despite the decline there, I wonder what the outlook is for your second half.","Michael M. Larsen","Yes. So Walter, this is Michael. I mean, we're not expecting significant improvement for the electronics business here for the balance of the year. You are right that there are some encouraging potential order activity going on in that segment, and that would be slight upside to our current expectations for the second half. But again, we're not counting on it at this point.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question, Ajay Kejriwal, FBR Capital Markets.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So on PLS, Scott, we've seen actions in a couple of segments here, Polymers & Fluids, Welding, Construction. I guess, the question, is there more opportunity in PLS either within these segments or maybe on the segments where we haven't seen that initiative being played out? So just if you can talk a little bit about what to expect on PLS in the next, say, 12 to 18 months.","E. Scott Santi","Yes. I would -- I think the -- we've talked, I think, throughout our description of what this business structure simplification initiative means, is that there's a structural element to it in terms of generating better scale and leverage and focus in terms of the division structure. And the second part of that is then the opportunity to reapply 80\/20 to all of those businesses. And so I think what I would say is we've moved -- it's largely a function of who's ready to get to that second stage more so than there's a particular -- there's a differential impact as you go segment by segment. So in the Polymers & Fluids business was -- got to that place earlier than some of the other segments. We're now at a place where pretty much across all 7 segments, it's an active part of, let's call it, Stage 2 of the BSS process. So I think it has just become -- it sort of moved again from a couple of segments to pretty much being implemented across all 7. It's a normal part of the process. Polymers & Fluids is going to get to the end of it sooner than the other segments because they started it first. But I think overall, that opportunity to reapply 80\/20 is a real significant and meaningful part of the overall impact on BSS. And it's an impact of that. It's just starting to show up in terms of overall margin and profitability performance.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So I guess, expect more PLS in the other segments where we haven't seen that started yet.","E. Scott Santi","Well, it's been started. I think it's, what would you say, pretty much from -- at a minimum the beginning of this year, everybody, I think, across the company's been in a pretty heavy teeing [ph] around, starting to really focus. Getting the structural stuff out of the way and really starting to focus on reapplying 80\/20 across the company. As we've said earlier, we've got another couple of quarters where, clearly, it's going to be an active part of what we're up to. And I think we need to get through the planning process and see how much -- what the '15 agenda looks like, business by business, in that regard.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And then China, we're seeing really good growth in Auto. And then overall, that 8% number, is that reflecting the impact in Welding? Or is there anything else going on in that 8% number?","Michael M. Larsen","Yes. That's the largest declines in revenue in China is indeed the Welding segment, as we've talked about, as we exited the shipbuilding market and really have focused on the energy side. And we believe that's where the -- not just the better margins reside, but also the better growth potential. So in the quarter, in China, strong performance in Automotive and Polymers & Fluids and Food Equipment. And then decline's primarily focused just in the Welding segment.","Operator","And gentlemen, I am showing no further questions at this time.","John L. Brooklier","Okay.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Larsen, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Larsen","Thank you, May. Good morning and welcome to ITW's second quarter 2016 conference call. I'm Michael Larsen, ITW's SVP and CFO and joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our second quarter 2016 financial results and update you on our 2016 earnings forecast. Following our comments, we will be happy to take your questions. And so that we can accommodate as many people as possible, we will limit each Q&A participant to one question and one follow-up question.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2016 third quarter and full-year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2015 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016 for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. While we use very few non-GAAP measures a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Santi","Thanks, Michael, and good morning. Overall we were very pleased with our second quarter performance as we continue to execute well and as a result delivered strong results and set several new all-time performance records for the company.","EPS of a $1.46 was up 12% year-on-year and came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, $0.04 from better margins, a penny from slightly higher revenue and $0.02 from non-operating items largely related to our minority ownership interest in our former decorative services segment.","Operating income of $792 million was up 8% year-on-year and was the highest quarterly operating income in the company's history. Q2 operating margins of 23.1% were up 180 basis points and after-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points to 22.9% both of which were all-time records for the company.","As I commented in our Q2 earnings release, these record results reinforce our conviction and the performance potential of ITW's business model and reflect directly on the great progress that our people around the world continue to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential. While we have made significant progress in this regard over the last 3.5 years, we see plenty of opportunity for further improvement ahead.","I'm also pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in our transition to focusing on accelerating organic growth. Organic growth excluding PLS impact of 2% of the enterprise level was pretty solid in this environment particularly when factoring in the 11% decline in our welding segment in the quarter.","All six of our other segments delivered a positive year-on-year organic growth in Q2. Net of welding in PLS impact organic growth for our six other segments combined with 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis our 2016 organic growth rate has improved by 130 basis points versus full year 2015 despite significant further erosion in welding demand and tough first half comps in our auto OEM segment.","A couple of final comments before I turn the call back to Michael. First earlier this month we completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW. This is a great addition of the company and I would like to publicly welcome the 3500 plus members of the EF&C team to ITW.","And second I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Scott and good morning everybody. Once again ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings and solid execution and improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to a $1.46 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range.","Organic revenue was up 2% growth, 1% when including PLS, with fairly stable demand globally and improving organic growth focus and performance across the company. Good progress in Q2 with 6 of 7 segments achieving positive organic growth with welding the only exception. In Q2 of last year, 3 out of 7 segments were growing organically.","Consumer facing businesses were up 3%, industrial facing down 2%, no material change from Q1. On the regional basis North America was up 0.4%, EMEA up 2.9%, APAC up 1% and China was up 0.4%.","A comment on the U.K. which represents 5% of ITW sales. In Q2 our U.K. sales were up 2% with no signs of a slowdown and in our opinion it is too early to tell what the longer term impact from Brexit may be. But at current FX rate, the weakening of the British Pound is modestly unfavorable which is expected into our updated guidance.","As Scott mentioned we established new all-time records on a number of our key performance metrics, operating margin of 23.1% up 180 basis points versus last year. Enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points to margin expansion with price cost and volume leverage and other contributing the remaining 60 basis points.","We grew operating income 8% to $792 million making this the most profitable quarter ever in ITW's history. After-tax, ROIC improved 260 basis points and was also new all time record at 22.9%.","We invested about $140 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. Free cash flow of $471 million was up 23% versus Q2 of last year and 90% to net income conversion was consistent with typical Q2 seasonality.","In the second quarter we allocated $500 million to share repurchases and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion in the second half bringing the total for the full year to approximately $2 billion with $1.2 billion from overseas funds and about $ 800 million from normal surplus cash flow.","In the second quarter ITW operating margin exceeded 23% for the first time and we listed the margin drivers on the right side of the page starting with 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives. Price cost came in as expected modestly favorable 20 basis points and volume leverage and other contributed the balance.","Continued strong margin expansion across the company with construction product up 440 basis points to 24.3%, Food Equipment of 300 basis points to 25%, Specialty Products, Test & Measurement and Electronics both up 250 basis points and Automotive up 130 basis points to 25.8%.","Polymers & Fluids was flat due to restructuring and in welding despite a 140 basis points of restructuring impact the quarter, operating margin was 24.9%. Welding's peak-to-trough revenues are now down approximately 20% and yet operating margins are still solid in the mid 20s. This performance although pretty challenging cycle is a good example of the resilience of the ITW business model.","Turning to the segment discussion and starting with Automotive OEM, another solid quarter with organic revenue up 4% against the top comparison last year as Scott mentioned earlier. In North America 3% organic growth, Europe was up 8% and China was up 13% despite the fact that overall bills were only up 4% and flat at Western OEMs. We expect growth rates to continue to improve in the second half as comparisons get a little easier.","Another very solid quarter in Food Equipment up 5% organically with broad-based strength on the equipment side including refrigeration, warewash, cooking and scales. North America was up 6% despite the top comparison with equipment up 9% driven by end market demand in K through 12 lodging, health care and retail and service was up 1%.","International was up 3% with equipment up 4% and service up 2%. And continued strong margin performance as volume leverage and savings from enterprise initiatives improved operating margin at 300 basis points to 25%.","Also a very solid quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics, as organic revenue grew 3%. Electronics platform grew 6% due to end market strength in solar and semiconductor. We talked about the margin expansion potential in the segment before, and we were pleased to see 250 basis points of improvement to 18.6%. And remember that the 18.6% includes 370 basis points of acquisition related non cash amortization charges which will beat up over time.","Declines in welding demand continued in Q2 with organic revenue down 11% in the quarter with equipment down 13% and consumables down 10%. The decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 5 points from industrial which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining and 1 point from commercial.","North America was down 8% with equipment down 10% and consumables down 5%. International was down 21% again due largely to oil and gas. If demand holds steady at current levels year-on-year percentage declines should moderate in the back half of 2016 due to easier comps. And like I said earlier, solid operating margin performance of 24.9% which includes 140 basis points of restructuring impact.","Polymers and fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 2% as this segment continues its pivot to growth after an extensive period of PLS process over the last three plus years.","On a regional basis North America was up 1 and international was up 3%. Approximately half of the segment revenues are related to automotive aftermarket which grew 3%. The balance is primarily industrial MRO applications as fluids improve 1% and polymers was flat. Overall margins were unchanged at 20.9% which includes 70 basis points of restructuring impact. ","As with our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment 20.9% includes 420 basis points of acquisition related non-cash amortization charges. Another solid quarter in construction products as organic revenue increased 3%, North America was down 1% with a tough year-over-year comparison of 15% in Q2 last year.","Renovation remodeling was down 6% after being up 22% in the first quarter and in the quarter - in North America commercial was up 5% and residential up 1% and overall we feel like we\u2019re exiting the quarter in good shape from a demand perspective.","On the last call we talked about how quarterly numbers in construction can be a little choppy and not necessarily a good indicator of overall levels of demand. To normalize trends, if you look at North America in the first half up 4%, renovation remodel up 6%, commercial up 7% and residential up 2%, you get a more accurate picture of the underlying levels of demand which are pretty solid.","Asia Pacific was up 7% due to Australia, Europe was up 6% driven by the U.K. up 7%, France up 6% and Germany up 10%. And again very strong progress in operating margin up 440 basis points to 24.3%.","Finally another solid quarter in specialty products with organic revenue flat, solid growth in consumer packaging offset by some lumpiness on the equipment side. And very good progress on our operating margin with an increase of 250 basis points to 26%.","Turning to EF&C, we\u2019re very pleased to complete this terrific acquisition on July 1. As you know in the automotive OEM space, with ITW's very focused strategic positioning, we\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to outgrow global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012. And given the visibility that we have in this business, we are confident that we will continue to outgrow auto builds by 200 to 400 basis points over the next several years.","We are excited about adding EF&C to ITW because it gives us some additional leverage on this very focused strategy and broadens our ability to serve and grow with our global and regional automotive OEM and Tier customers. It expands our ability to drive our global content per vehicle and increase our share of the relevant market. For reference, our global content of $30 per vehicle compares to a relevant market that is greater than $200 per vehicle.","Specifically EF&C adds a number of things to our current position. First of all it adds several new strategic differentiated product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platform that we support today. And on a regional basis with its global strategically located manufacturing facilities, it is very complimentary to our geographic footprint which is a little more weighted towards North America.","So it gives us better global balance overall. And certainly we continue to see significant potentials to leverage our 80\/20 business management process and help the EF&C team continue to improve its operating metrics.","Operating margin entering ITW are about 10%, and we\u2019re confident that we have a clear path to doubling that rate at a minimum over the next 5 years.","EF&C already has a very experienced and capable operating team with a reputation for delivering reliable quality and excellent customer service performance. From the standpoint of the transaction and the financial components, purchase price of $450 million is less than one-time sales and the business is actually performing slightly better than expected. The 2016 financial impact is 2.20 million to 2.40 million of revenues, so 110 to 120 in Q3 and in Q4.","From a margin standpoint, EF&C has dilutive approximately 50 basis points to ITW operating margin and after tax ROIC and dilutive approximately 200 basis points to the Automotive OEM segment. So to be clear, excluding EF&C we would have guided to approximately 23% operating margin for the full year to-date including the EF&C we\u2019re maintaining our prior guidance of greater than 22.5%.","From an EPS standpoint, we expect no impact in 2016 due to typical acquisition accounting related impacts but certainly accretive in 2017. And we are confident that we can generate after tax returns in the mid to high teens by year seven. ","Last page, our updated guidance for 2016 assumes current foreign exchange rates and includes the acquisition of EF&C. We're raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.50 to $5.70. The $5.60 midpoint represents 9% earnings growth on the year-over-year basis.","We expect that demand remains stable at current levels and as a result we\u2019re narrowing our full year organic growth forecast to 1% to 2% due to the more challenging than expected market conditions in welding.","Consistent with prior forecast our guidance includes approximately one percentage point of PLS impacts, so excluding PLS we expect full year organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%. Keep in mind that while PLS does reduce revenues in the short term, it is both a critical driver of our margin performance and a key component of our portfolio management strategy, as we exit slower growth product lines and focus on our most compelling opportunities to accelerate organic growth at ITW caliber margins.","As I said earlier operating margin guidance is unchanged at greater than 22.5% but now includes approximately 50 basis points of dilution from EF&C. We're maintaining our previously communicated target of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year and finally for the third quarter our GAAP EPS guidance including EF&C is $1.42 to $1.52 assuming operating margin of approximately 23% and 1% to 3% organic growth.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief and as a reminder one question and one follow-up question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mr. Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks and good morning, everyone. So I guess my first question is on organic growth. It was nice to see the organic growth improvement in 2Q versus 1Q despite the weakness that you guys saw in welding. I'm just curious, as you look into the third quarter guidance of 1% to 3%, are you seeing underlying trends improve as you exit the quarter because it seems like you're guiding to a number that's slightly better in the comps on a two year basis - don't really change much.","Michael Larsen","Well, Joe, if you look at it, we are assuming current levels of demand going into Q3 and the slight bump in overall year-over-year organic growth rate is due to the comps. So we\u2019re assuming no acceleration in Q3 or Q4 at current demand levels.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. Michael, and then I guess - I mean we're current - where were you exiting the quarter at demand levels that were slightly better as you progressed through the quarter? I'm just curious to\u2026","Scott Santi","Pretty steady - pretty steady through the quarter.","Michael Larsen","Yes, it was a pretty steady as we went through the quarter on the monthly basis like we said pretty firm overall in the second quarter and we feel pretty good going into Q3 and Q4.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I guess my one follow-up - maybe touching on welding for a second since clearly trends got a little bit worse this quarter. It was really nice to see the decrementals were solid on the welding side. I'm just wondering if trends persist are you expecting the same type of decrementals for the second half of the year?","And then to your comment earlier, Michael, on how to think about welding for the second half, are you just assuming like maybe a 3 to 4 point improvement because comps eased by that much for the second half of the year?","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Yes, the expectation through the balance of the year on the revenue side for welding and current demand rates were down mid-single digits in Q3and Q4. That slightly-- the rate is better because of the comps get easier, but we're \u2013 in our scenario based on what we're seeing right now, we're still expecting some further decline.","From the standpoint of the incremental margins they should be certainly right in line; some of the benefits from the structuring charges that we incurred in Q2 should start to show up in Q3 and Q4. ","Scott Santi","Yes, these are pretty steady margins as we go into the back half based on what we know today. ","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. Great, thanks guys. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator ","Our next question is from Mr. John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. ","John Inch","Thanks, good morning everyone. EF&C just now that the deal's closed, what sort of intangible amortization is part of this deal and what kind of accretion are we looking at next year assuming the run rate?","Michael Larsen","Yes, so what I can tell you in terms of accretion our view is that this will be modestly accretive in 2017. But let's get in there and take a look and make sure we give you a more accurate view than probably when we get to our Analyst Day in December we'll be able to give you a little bit more detail. But we just bought the business, we got to get in there and then we'll give you a more accurate view. ","Q \u2013 John Inch","Did you say anything on the intangible amortization, Michael?","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","We are not completely done yet, so it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to comment on that. I mean, I think again we will expect no EPS impact here in the second half of the year neutral on EPS slightly dilutive our margins and then the next year modestly accretive with accelerating benefits beyond that.","Q \u2013 John Inch","All right. So shifting gears, I appreciate your comments on the UK. I think other companies have more or less said it's still too early to say anything. It's hard from our perspective, I mean generically our perspective, to surmise why Europe doesn't suffer some sort of economic deferral or confidence issues. Certainly you can see European investors rotating into US stocks. They're clearly concerned. Right? My question - you guys have a lot of European exposure relative to other industrial companies. What - you've done a fantastic job and you've clearly - I think people see the flex in your business model. But I can't imagine you're complacent.","Right? So I'm trying to understand - what is your strategy for managing through what could be possibly deteriorating fundamentals in Europe? And as the crawl rate to that, you - I'd like to know how this perhaps dovetails into your own M&A strategy. And specifically you clearly want to do more deals, you just don't want to put the cart before the horse. But if things were to deteriorate, does that cause you to do more deals sooner perhaps or just push them out? Just how are you think about that? I'm sorry the question is long. There's just a lot of context to it.","Scott Santi","Let me try to hit all the points and let me know if I miss anything, right. I think overall our strategy is no different than how we operate the company day-to-day which is we are \u2013 we have a very - on a relative basis a very flexible cost structure, we are a fast reactor; we're not a predictor of the future.","And I think as you\u2019re seeing in welding right now we are certainly confident in our ability to react in an effective way to whatever sort of the cards, however the cards play out in Europe. I think right now and it's certainly reflected in our Q2results there we're not seeing anything yet it's obviously very early.","But I think overall I don't really see any difference between sort of the kind of contingency planning we would do around the whole Brexit situation and the other contingency planning that we would do relative to global macroeconomic conditions generally in whatever region of the world.","From an M&A standpoint, I think all I would say that go back to where we\u2019ve talked about repeatedly which is the primary focus of the company right now is, is that we\u2019ve got a collection in our view of terrific assets and our primary focus is operating the assets we already have to the best of our ability and there is certainly more runway to go in terms of getting to our \u2013 from where we are to what we view as our full potential.","And the M&A we\u2019re doing is really largely bolting on to one of the existing seven businesses that we have and as those opportunities, you know, if should other opportunities emerge at our good faith we will certainly not hesitate. But I think we are very convicted about our ability to continue to grow earnings, growing and continue to improve the operating metrics of the businesses that we own.","Q \u2013 John Inch","Maybe one more, Scott, just because you're such a big company in Europe, has Brexit or other issues in Europe caused you as a corporation to defer or modify what otherwise investments you might have been making into Europe and\/or step up PLS in some manner or restructuring?","Scott Santi","No. It\u2019s just way too early. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to panic and I certainly don\u2019t think we want to try to anticipate what\u2019s going to happen because nobody knows. But I wouldn\u2019t go back to what I said earlier I think our view to react effectively quickly to whatever happens is pretty solid.","Q \u2013 John Inch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. David Raso from Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. I know it's a little early being July but sort of the setup into the December meeting is going to be important about accelerating the organic growth and you laid out about a year and a half ago the idea of businesses getting ready to grow. And it seems like a fairly sizable increase in the amount of your business as you feel will be ready to grow going into next year than this year.","Can you help us point out which of the businesses do you feel are entering that phase and we should look at particularly into next year as the ones that will make that jump to being ready to grow?","Scott Santi","Well, we\u2019re \u2013 at the segment level, you know, within each of our segments there are businesses that are certainly there. I\u2019m trying to sort of \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to get at your question, I think clearly based on current performance autos very far along, for the equipment very far along I think we are making some really strong progress in the other five segments. And it\u2019s not a matter of flipping the switch going from not ready to ready. It\u2019s more of an acceleration overtime as more as of the division in five each segment make that transition.","In my view is that we\u2019ve \u2013 our second quarter results certainly reflect solid progress in the right direction and you can \u2013 we will - we expect it to continue to improve quarter-by-quarter. But it\u2019s not a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s not a matter of flipping the switch and going from not focus on growth to all in with both feet.","David Raso","I'm just trying to figure out, Scott, the idea of - of course the ability to grow is trying to be characterized as not necessarily that sensitive to the end market. Right? It's more of a change in attitude about how you're going to push the business going forward. But I'm just trying to package that in so which of the end markets that maybe I'm more comfortable with or less comfortable with in 2017.","So I was just trying to pinpoint where are those particular end businesses that at least you kind of see as their attitude's going to change a bit 2016 going into 2017. It's been building towards it. Just so I can kind of track that progression as we exit 2016 into 2017. Are there some businesses you would at least highlight outside of auto and food right? Those are already pretty far along. Welding's obviously got some macro issues. Maybe those comp C's. But if you can just help us a little bit to flesh it out for our own field work.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean David as Scott said, this is really a process that\u2019s being orchestrated to vision all level. So we have 84 divisions at the end of last year, 60% of our revenues were in that ready-to-grow category. And we look at the progress every quarter and we are on track to get to the 85% ready-to-grow. So most of the company will be in a position to accelerate organic growth going into '17 and it\u2019s a gradual timeline.","So every month, every quarter divisions reach that phase of being ready-to-grow and that\u2019s at the segment level we have different levels of progress based on when the segments really start to focus on the organic growth, strategy. And so it\u2019s hard to really comment at the segment and the end market level beyond what we just walked you through.","David Raso","Okay. So I mean just to leave it as then bigger picture - macro the same a year from now as it is today, the idea is with 25% more of the more of the Company ready to grow going into 2017 than you had going in 2016, the base case should be the Company should be able to accelerate as organic.","Michael Larsen","That\u2019s fair.","A \u2013 Scott Santi","Well, and you saw the slide, the second slide, really illustrates that point, right, where you look at our first half growth rate relative to last year in an environment that\u2019s pretty similar. Good progress on the overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level.","David Raso","And the PLS drag is less next year than this year? That's still base case?","A \u2013Scott Santi","Yes, we have to get through the planning process here in the fall. But I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that PLS will be less than '17 than in '16.","David Raso","Terrific. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Nigel Coe","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to welding. And I think, Scott, you mentioned that the comps get a lot easier in the second half of the year. And you're assuming that the business is sequentially stable from 2Q. We get into that mid single-digit declines. I'm just wondering, just given the normalcy of knowing that business, do you think 2Q represents a flaw for that business or would you expect second half to be a little bit lower in line with normalcy now.","A \u2013Scott Santi","I don\u2019t think of that. I wouldn\u2019t - given what we\u2019re seeing I would certainly not call it a floor. I think, our expectation heading into the year was that \u2013 that was going to flatten out at some point in '16. And clearly that\u2019s you know based on the first two quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that. So I \u2013 I think we got to see what the future holds there a little bit.","But our planning assumption is I think sufficiently conservative in terms of it's you know impacting the overall forecast for the back half of the year. But it\u2019s still a pretty choppy environment and Michael gave you some numbers before down to 15% year-on-year in industrial oil and gas. Six quarters in here it\u2019s still pretty challenging. ","Q \u2013 Nigel Coe","Yes. Understand. And then just switching to price cost as a follow-on. 20 bps relatively modest. Maybe can you just maybe decompose that between price and raws? And the reason why is that obviously we've got steel inflation coming through in the next six to nine months. And I'm wondering how we should think about that price cost gap developing.","A \u2013Scott Santi","Yes. So Nigel as the price cost came in as expected as you point out and slightly favorable a 20 basis points again. And as you know maybe different from some other companies, price cost has not been a significant margin driver over the last three years. And I think what\u2019s going on inside the businesses is really with the support from our strategic sourcing team. The businesses are closely monitoring the material cost side and taking appropriate action on the price side.","And on both price and material costs, we\u2019ve not seen any significant impact or any change in terms of the result in the second quarter. And so going forward we remain confident that we can continue to generate this type of modest price cost favorability on a go forward basis.","Q \u2013 Nigel Coe","Okay, I\u2019ll leave at that. Thank you.","Operator","Nest question is from Mr. Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Andrew Kaplowitz","Hi, good morning, guys. So Test & Measurements and Electronics return to growth for the first time I think since mid-2014. How much of the improvement is the markets getting better versus easier comparison versus ITW's specific focus on pivotal growth? I know you're probably going to say all three, but if there's any additional color on what is going on there that'd be helpful.","And have you seen any increase in capital equipment spent on the Test & Measurement side? And electronics at 6%, you mentioned the strength in semis does seem like a pretty strong result versus what you can see.","Scott Santi","Yes, I think the way I would characterize it is things pretty stable on a Test & Measurement side but no big and or even modest improvement in terms of underlying buying activity but certainly a solid stable performance. And on the Electronic side as we talked about some nice sequential improvement in the two sectors that you referenced. I think we want to see another quarter or two before we decide that that\u2019s a long term trend. But overall it\u2019s a nice improvement. ","Q \u2013 Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. That's helpful, Scott. And maybe - you've obviously done very well versus the enterprise strategy goal that you've set now really several years ago. How do we think about - it's tough organic growth environment here in 2016 again. But the one goal that's out there you doing 20 basis points better than global industrial production still seemed a little hard to achieve if welding continues to be weak.","How do you look at that goal here over the next couple of years? Do you need welding to improve? Can you do it with still weak welding if the other segments are good? How do you look at that goal?","A \u2013Scott Santi","Well, I think if welding continues to shrink 11% a quarter it certainly going to be a tough. It\u2019s going to be a tough not to crack. But clearly that\u2019s not our expectation. I don\u2019t think it would be anybody\u2019s expectation that\u2019s a \u2013 that whole industry is a core part of the industrial economy around the world. We have a terrific position in it. They are certainly sort of the double whammy right now of oil and gas and slow industrial investment but all of that\u2019s creating a lot of pent-up demand at the same time.","So things going around in our history in welding is that coming out of these sort of down cycles in the market. There is 8 to 12 quarter run of some really strong recovery. I don\u2019t think there is anything fundamental exchange in our view of in terms of the overall attractiveness of the welding market.","And so I think in general what I would point to in terms of our \u2013 and our conviction remains unchanged in terms of our goal. We've worked really hard to shape this portfolio, so that we are operating in spaces everywhere where the product really matters to the customers as long as we continue to generate solutions that will help our customers serve their customers better.","And we\u2019ve got plenty of room to outgrow the underlying economy and we are not step off that a one bit in terms of our both our commitment to it and all the efforts going on inside the company to make that happen. ","Q \u2013 Andrew Kaplowitz","All right. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Next question is from Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to circle back on EF&C and some more specifics on the business now that you own it. And, Scott, you called out some new platforms. I'd be interested in hearing just broadly what the new platforms are or the adjacencies and then maybe where there might be overlaps?","And is this where you're going to bring in product line simplification and what percent that might be versus the revenue base today?","A \u2013Scott Santi","Yes, not a lot of overlap, it\u2019s one of the attractive things about it both from a product line and a customers - from a product line and customer standpoint. In terms of the complimentary platform it probably gets a little too messy to try to get into in too much detail.","Let me just say that they are similar to the current platforms we are in and that they are highly sort of value-added engineered solutions to specific OEM customer needs, some different categories in terms of the actual functionality.","But largely the similar types of position that we have in our core business. So lot\u2019s of opportunity to add those categories to the existing categories we have. I think what I would say is we will clearly spend some time on this in December and it would be more effective for us to do so then as we\u2019ve had a couple of quarters worth of business under our belt.","From a standpoint of PLS certainly my expectation is that we are going to have a fair amount of it there under our normal application of 80\/20 less so related to dealing with overlap as I said it\u2019s not a big issue. But we need to - and we have some initial views based on some of our due diligence but we certainly need some time to get in there over the next couple of quarters, and really look at it at a much more fulsome way. But it will be part of the mix for a while. Part of the margin improvement agenda there.","Deane Dray","Great. And then what about the margin goals that you've laid out to basically double margins by year 5? Have you thought through, can you share what that progression might be? I would imagine the gains come more in the back half of that time frame as opposed to being linear.","Scott Santi","Now, I would say they\u2019d probably play at a little more linear and sort of a typical integration. This is as we\u2019ve talked before the application of 80\/20 is in our quick fix. It\u2019s a three to five year process from go to full integration. And I would say again we will have a better view of what we will be able to get down in '17 on this when we are a couple of quarters down the road. But I think in general I would - I think a more appropriate planning assumption would be a couple of points a year for the next five, then a big hockey stick.","Q \u2013 Deane Dray","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, one of the things within the food equipment results today, I was surprised to see service not a little bit better given the kind of focus that you've put on it there. Is there anything in the quarter that might have been a drag there? Should we start seeing service become a more meaningful contributor?","A \u2013 Scott Santi","The answer to the second question is absolutely, I think some of the problems with these quarterly - with these quarterly calibrations are these are strategies that play out over the course of the year. So you\u2019ve got a lot of things bouncing around. I don\u2019t - sitting here right now I can\u2019t say whether there is \u2013 there is a sort of what the top profile was in service and food equipment. But in general as you said we\u2019ve got a lot of focus on service. It\u2019s a great business and a great competitive advantage for us. ","The other thing is that there is some PLS have a couple of parts of that business going on right now but my assumption is that if I look at it deeper but my assumption is that\u2019s probably had some impact in Q2. ","Q \u2013 Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you. ","Operator","Next question is from Mr. Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Mig Dobre","Good morning, everyone. If I may just going back to the broader organic growth question from - questions from earlier, just kind of looking at the quarter here EMEA certainly ended up outgrowing all the regions - 3% versus everywhere else growth at 1% or below. And I'm just wondering, from your perspective looking into the back half of the year, do you still expect this kind of leadership from EMEA or are you thinking that we're going to see acceleration from North America deliver those organic growth goals of yours?","A \u2013 Scott Santi","Yes, I think Mig if you look at the first half growth rates both international and North America kind of in the low single digits that\u2019s probably a good way to think about the back half of the year. So we certainly don\u2019t expect any acceleration on a regional basis and as you know we don\u2019t run the company that way.","Q \u2013 Mig Dobre","Okay. And then maybe, again, going back to food equipment, can you provide any commentary in terms of what's been driving the growth in equipment? I'm wondering if there's anything to differentiate in terms of ware washing versus cooking, refrigeration - any color there would be helpful.","A \u2013 Scott Santi","Yes, Mig, I made some comments earlier really that this was broad based strength in terms of the product lines with refrigeration, warewash, cooking and the retail side with scales overall really strong performance across the board but as you heard equipment up 9% in North America.","Michael Larsen","And I would characterize as it is much more of a function of significant part of food equipment business reaching that ready-to-grow stage. It\u2019s been there for the last year or so and just been in a position to be much more aggressive in terms of attacking our growth opportunities. The innovation pipeline there is terrific. That\u2019s certainly is contributing, but it\u2019s more of an end product of all the work that we\u2019ve done to get the portfolio right get the business simplified and get it focused on its best growth opportunities.","Q \u2013 Mig Dobre","Right. And I appreciate that, but obviously the drivers are, I presume, a little bit different, ware washing versus hot side cooking. Right?","A \u2013 Scott Santi","I don\u2019t think \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say they are a lot different based on what I just said. We\u2019ve got a highly competitive, highly differentiated product lines with great opportunity to grow and are now in a position to really focus on attacking that.","Q \u2013 Mig Dobre","All right. Thanks for your comment.","Operator","Next question is from Andy Casey. Your line is now open from Wells Fargo.","Q \u2013 Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. A question kind of going back to pricing. I know, as you just said, Scott, the Company focuses on differentiated product and that kind of shields ITW from price competition. But we are seeing some evidence of competitive pricing in some of the markets that you really don't participate in directly. Did any of the segments realize negative pricing or see competitors resort to price actions to try to drive their volume?","A \u2013 Scott Santi","Yes, I think Andy this was a Q2 that this year that look a lot like Q1 and a lot like Q2 last year. So we would say at the enterprise level and even at the segment level no significant changes on the pricing side.","Q \u2013 Andy Casey","Okay. That's good news. And then on the EF&C acquisition, the accounting impact, do you expect to realize all that in Q3 or is that going to be kind of carryover into Q4?","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Yes, I really don\u2019t want to get into too much detail here. But in terms of Q3 versus Q4, we are just getting going here, Andy. And what I can tell you is for the second half based on what we know today we expect it to be neutral. And I don\u2019t think it will be a big swing on a quarterly basis but I don\u2019t know that for sure yet.","Q \u2013 Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael.","Operator","Next question is from Ann Duignan from JBMC. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning, I'm still with JPMorgan.","Michael Larsen","Thank you. Good to hear it.","Ann Duignan","At least I think I am. A lot of my questions have been answered but maybe you could give us a little bit more color on China in general and how the various businesses progressed during the quarter in China?","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Yes. So I think China overall was flat with strong performance in Automotive. Auto up 13%, Test & Measurement fairly solid, low single digit growth some challenges you would expect on the Welding side and Food down slightly. But I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. So, overall a good quarter in China.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you. And then just back to - overall, we've heard from some other suppliers that there are several OEMs who are shutting down production in Q3 for extended periods. I think you kind of alluded to that perhaps in the welding business but are any of your other businesses seeing any extended shutdowns from the customers?","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Not that I\u2019m aware of.","Ann Duignan","Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there.","Operator","Next question is from Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Joel Tiss","Yes. Almost everything's been answered already. Thank you guys for taking the time. I just wondered generally acquisition prices, are they reasonable? Because you guys are a little different than everyone else. You're very zeroed in on specific areas or you see a little inflation out there and it's tough to find things.","A \u2013 Scott Santi","Well, we did one deal. So I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re a market maker on or can give you a good feedback overall. It\u2019s not something where I think we have enough of an active effort on to be a \u2013 to give you any good insight or input on acquisition prices generally.","Q \u2013 Joel Tiss","Okay, all right. Well, that was it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Steve Volkmann","Hi, good morning. My follow-up first maybe this time. You made a comment earlier about PLS being less in 2017, but I guess that means it's not going to go away. Does it ever go away? Is it - does go to a normal level? I mean how do we just think of the cadence of PLS longer term?","A \u2013 Scott Santi","Yes, I think eventually it goes down to a level where it\u2019s \u2013 whatever described as normal maintenance probably less than half a percent a year I think. I don\u2019t want to get too specific here because as Michael said we stopped looking through the plating cycle.","But the big lot of activity on this for the company over the last three years plus has really been around the portfolio strategy execution. Once we get it to where we wanted, it certainly becomes something that we do some minor pruning on an annual basis. But it\u2019s not something that we even talk about it anymore at that point and maybe that\u2019s a couple of years out from here.","Q \u2013 Steve Volkmann","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on restructuring, I wonder do you have additional restructuring in your plans for 3Q, 4Q? And maybe if you could just touch on sort of what you're doing there and how we should think about that impact in 2017.","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Yes, Steve our restructuring assumption for the year in that $60 million to $70 million range is unchanged. And we don\u2019t expect any significant changes to that as we go through the Q3 and Q4. Even current levels of demand were at 60 to 70 and don\u2019t see anything right now that would take it outside of that range.","Q \u2013 Steve Volkmann","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. One, I know you don't want to comment on the auto acquisition. But I guess on your other businesses as we exit 2016, how should we think about amortization expense from acquisitions? Because I would assume that's another tailwind as we think about 2017 versus 2016. And then another clarification just on FX impact to EPS. I think last quarter you guided to $0.20. Did you change that number with the pound? That's all I have.","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Yes, let me start with the last one. I think the 20 euro frankly was a way back win at the beginning of the year. If there is a lot of volatility as you know on the currency side of things. And so while at current rates we would expect it to be less than 20 it\u2019s really hard to put hard and fast number out there given all the volatility.","On the intangible amortization, we expect that to continue to go down to two segments where we talk about this Test & Measurement and Polymers & Fluids it\u2019s maybe something like 30 to 50 basis points of favorability on an annual basis in those two segments. So\u2026","Q \u2013 Jamie Cook","Okay, great. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Fisher","Thanks, good morning. The Q3 margin guidance implies a moderating of the year-over-year improvements in margins, even if you adjust for the 50 basis points of EF&C. It doesn't sound like there's a lot more restructuring there. Are we just sort of getting to the maturity point of the margin improvement or is there perhaps some conservatism there?","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Yes, it\u2019s certainly not like we\u2019re getting to a level of maturity here. So, as you know, we have guided to 100 basis points of margin expansion this year and in '17 independent of volume and Scott talked a little bit about how much more potential we still have inside the company. Really the last year, if you recall, margins were up 180 basis points. We had a really strong third quarter last year. And so it\u2019s really more of a comp issue than anything else. ","Steve Fisher","Okay. That's helpful. And then how have your expectations changed for the industrial-facing businesses year-over-year? Last quarter I think you said there was maybe a chance that you could get to neutral exiting the year. Has welding now taken a step backwards there or how are you thinking about that consumer versus industrial by kind of exiting the year?","A \u2013 Scott Santi","Well, I think I\u2019ll just go back to what I said earlier. I think welding given the performance in the first two quarters, the contraction is certainly continuing on longer than - expectation is kind of the funny word because we tend to just react to the conditions that we\u2019re seeing.","But I think ultimately heading into the year given the kind of decline we saw last year I think we are hopeful that things were going to flatten out by the back half clearly given the first two quarters that\u2019s not the case. But at some point it\u2019s going to happen.","And I think what we\u2019re doing in the short run is managing the cost structure with some restructuring actions and other things we\u2019re doing to, to do what we should be doing in the short term while preserving our position in our markets and certainly being ready to participate fully as things turn around up there. So I don\u2019t \u2013 but at the same time, we\u2019re performing better on margins, we\u2019re certainly offsetting more than offsetting the impact of weldings having on the short term and that\u2019s one of the values of portfolio of seven really strong businesses is we\u2019re never probably going to have all seven going in the 100% in the right direction all at the same time.","But we\u2019re going to have enough of them around at the overall enterprise performance in whatever environment which is going to be pretty good darn good.","Steve Fisher","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question is from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.","Walter Liptak","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the food equipment business and the 300 basis points of margin improvement and if there's a way of measuring how much of that was 80\/20 enterprise initiatives and how much was volume related.","A \u2013 Michael Larsen","Yes, the best detail and the most detail that we give you, was in the appendix and the press release. Since if you look at Food total margin expansion 300 basis points 110 of that was from operating leverage. Similar to what you saw in Q1 as these businesses begin to accelerate growth you see really nice improvement on the margin side as a result.","And then in addition approximately 80 basis points of enterprise initiative and other margin expansion and then restructuring was slightly lower this year versus the second quarter last year. And so we break that out in the press release by segment and total ITW.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Got it, great. Okay. And just as a follow-up on the EF&C business, the doubling in margin - and it's been a while since you guys have done an acquisition like this. I wonder how much of this is new programs related to the business management system and if at all you're thinking this is sort of like a new - like a test case for future acquisitions?","Scott Santi","I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a test case. I think our track record even though it has been a while, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve forgotten how to do this. We\u2019ve been in many ways being doing this everything we\u2019re going to do at the EF&C at all 84 of our other divisions over the last couple of years which is front to back we\u2019re applying our 80\/20 management system.","So I think our methodology is inside the company is extremely well defined, extremely well proven. We have a fair all business running at mid-20\u2019s EBIT margin and we\u2019re adding this too. So I don\u2019t think there is any sort of mystery of bag what we need to do and the process we\u2019re going to use to make it happen.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","The last question in the queue is from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Your line is now open.","Eli Lustgarten","Thank you. Good morning. Most of the stuff has been answered. Just a clarification. You said restructuring is going to be about the same as planned before but you had 140 basis point impact on welding and 70 basis point in polymers and fluids. What kind of an impact from restructuring should we expect on margins in the second half of the year from the ongoing restructuring?","Scott Santi","Very similar to the first half. So the way we plan this is at a very measured pace and if you go back and we\u2019ve got a restructuring spend on the quarterly basis it\u2019s very consistent in that $16 million to $17 million range and so that takes us to 60 million to 70 million for the year. And obviously that is included in our guidance. So we\u2019re not adding anything back here.","Eli Lustgarten","Okay. And secondly, I think you said the $2 billion share repurchase - $1.2 billion is coming from overseas?","Scott Santi","So, if you recall it in the back end of first quarter earlier this year, we were able to access a little over $1 billion, $1.2 billion of overseas funds that we\u2019ve allocated to the share buyback program. And so that portion is done. And the comment was that the 800 million, the balance that takes us to $2 billion that\u2019s really more of an \u2013 think of that as a more normal run rate for the company. And so that's our kind of our typical surplus cash flow that this year is being allocated to the share buyback program.","Eli Lustgarten","All right. Thank you very much.","Scott Santi","All right.

At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir you may begin.","Michael M. Larsen","Hi, thank you, Leon, good morning and welcome to ITW's fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results, update you on our 2017 earnings forecast.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the first quarter and full-year 2017, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2015 Form 10-K and third quarter 2016 for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and while we use very few non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","E. Scott Santi","Thanks Michael and good morning. The fourth quarter closed out a year of record financial performance and strong execution for ITW. In fact 2016 was the most profitable year in the company\u2019s 104 year history. Earnings per share of $5.70 was up 11% versus 2015 and we achieved all time record performance in the following key operating metrics.","Operating income of $3.1 billion was up 7%, operating margin of 22.5% was up 110 basis points and after-tax return on invested capital of 22.1% was up 170 basis points. We continue to generate strong free cash flow in 2016, which we utilized to reinvest in the growth and productivity of our core businesses and to acquire EF&C, a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for our Automotive OEM segment. We also returned more than $2.8 billion of surplus capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","The end of 2016 also marked a completion of the fourth year of our enterprise strategy. We launched our current strategy in late 2012 with a goal of positioning ITW to deliver solid growth with best in class margins and returns. In conjunction with our strategy we have implemented major steps to focus the entire company and leveraging ITWs highly differentiated and proprietary business model to drive profitable growth and enhance productivity throughout ITW.","We have come a long way since we started over four years ago and ITWs performance is now approaching best in class levels. That being said, it is clear to us that we have significant capacity to further improve our performance. Within the framework of our current strategy before ITW is operating to its full potential.","Moving forward we will remain focused on pushing our performance to our full potential by capitalizing on the significant opportunities that we have in front of us. For meaningful additional structural margin improvement and sustained above market organic growth. To our continuing focus on a commitment to executing our strategy, we are well positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2017 and beyond.","I'd like to close by acknowledging the huge debt of gratitude that we owe to our more than 50,000 ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in executing our strategy and serving our customers with excellence each and every day. They are responsible for ITWs strong performance over the last four years and give us great confidence in our ability to continue to improve and make further progress in the past ITWs full potential.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q4 performance and 2017 forecast. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen","Thank you, Scott. Taking a look at slide 3, ITW finished 2016 with another strong quarter of differentiated operational and financial performance as evidenced by record quarterly operating income, operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. GAAP EPS of $1.45 increased 18% and exceed a midpoint of our guidance with $0.03 from better than expected organic growth and operating margin and $0.06 net benefit from non-recurring items.","In the quarter, we received $167 million cash dividend distribution related to our investment in Wilsonart, the former decorative services segment. The resulting EPS benefit of $0.10 was partially offset by $0.04 of one-time non-cash charges related to two small divestitures of non-core assets. The net benefit of these items is the sixth sense and without them, EPS grew 13%. Total revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 4% and organic growth was 2%, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance.","Operating margin was 21.8%. 22.2% excluding EF&C and all seven segments improved margins. Operating income grew 9% to $742 million and free cash flow of $593 million was 170% of net income. So, overall we\u2019re very pleased with our strong finish to 2016.","On slide 4, you\u2019ll see that our enterprise initiatives continue to be the key driver of our operating margin performance as they contributed 130 basis points. This was the 13th quarter that enterprise initiatives exceeded 100 basis points. Our performance was minimally offset by price cost, which was slightly unfavorable this quarter due to higher metal and resin prices. Volume leverage was 40 basis points and EF&C diluted margin 40 basis points resulting in operating margin of 12.8%, an increase of 110 basis points and a new Q4 record for the company.","Turning to page 5, let\u2019s go into detail around segment results. Starting with Automotive OEM, we had a really strong quarter with organic revenue of 7% and solid penetration gains. In North America 2% organic growth compares to auto bills of 1%. But keep in mind that number includes the builds down 3% with the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content. Europe was up 8% with 500 basis points of penetration gains and China was up 33% also with very significant penetration gains. Excluding EF&C operating margin improved 320 basis points in Q4.","Food Equipment had a solid quarter up 3% organically, North America equipment was up 9% due to strong demand for warewash, refrigeration and cooking. As expected service was down as we continue to work through the final phase of some fairly significant PLS activity. International equipment was flat and service was up 1%.","Turning to slide 6, we also had another good quarter for Test & Measurement\/Electronics and as underlying demand trends remain pretty stable. Organic revenue was flat, but margins improved 200 basis points to 20.1%. The underlying demand levels in welding have remained pretty stable for three quarters now. Year-over-year it\u2019s still pretty challenging, as evidenced by the 8% decline in organic revenues, but as you know comparisons start to ease now and that current is welding organic growth rates should be down low-to-mid single digits in Q1. The 8% decline in year-over-year revenues breaks down as 2 points from oil and gas, 5 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining and 1 point from commercial. On the margin front, margin improved again in welding this time by 190 basis points to 24.4%.","Turning to slide 7, Polymers & Fluids delivered positive organic revenue growth of 2%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was up 1%. Automotive aftermarket and Polymers both grew 3% and Fluids declined 1%. Construction Products grew 3% organically, North America was up a solid 4%, with residential remodel up 6% and commercial down 3%.","As you know quarterly growth rates can be a little lump in this segment. For the full year, North America commercial construction was up 4%, which is a better indicator of the underlying demand trends heading into 2017. Keep in mind also that the year-over-year comparison in the first quarter is pretty challenging. In Q1 2016, construction was up 5% with North America up 11%. Asia Pacific was up 1% and Europe was up 3%.","Turning to slide 8, in Specialty Products organic revenue was up 1% solid growth in our consumer packaging, consumable businesses was offset by weaker demand for capital equipment. On the right side of the page, you can see the broad-based improvement in operating margin by segment. On a year-over-year basis and since we launched the enterprise strategy in 2012. It's worth noting that at the enterprise level, the non-cash expense associated with amortizing the acquisition related intangible assets has an impact of 170 basis points of operating margin and roughly $0.50 of EPS.","On slide 9, you can see that we\u2019re continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth. In 2016 our organic growth rate improved 160 basis points. Six of our seven segments delivered positive year-on-year organic growth. 85% of our divisions have achieved ready to grow status. In addition ITW generated organic growth above the average of our peer group and while we have more work to do to sustain organic growth and our goal is 2 percentage points or more above market, at a minimum these data points are good indicators of meaningful progress and they give us confidence that we're on the right track for 2017 and beyond.","As Scott mentioned and as you can see on slide 10, 2016 was a record year, we achieved double digit EPS growth and increased revenue of $13.6 billion. Our enterprise strategy initiatives contributed 130 basis points of margin expansion as five of seven segments increased their operating margins. We increased the dividend 18%, allocated $2 billion of surplus capital to share repurchases and converted 100% of net income to free cash flow for the year.","If you adjust for the timing of $145 million in cash tax payments year-over-year. Free cash flow conversion would have been 107% and more in line with 106% in 2015. Total shareholder returns for 2016 was 35% well ahead of the market in our peer group. By any financial measure ITW delivered another great year.","Turning to slide 11, before discussing our outlook for 2017, I want to take this opportunity to briefly reflect on the progress of our enterprise strategy. Over the past four years we've had essentially achieved all the goals that we laid out in 2012, including increasing ITWs core operating margins from 15.9% to 22.5% and after-tax return on invested capital from 14.5% to 22.1%.","As Scott, said even though our performance is nearing best in class levels we continue to see meaningful potential for further performance improvement as we work hard to deliver on ITWs full performance potential. As demonstrated on slide 12, that potential is reflected in our long term financial performance targets that will increase at our investor day in December. We maintain a clear line of sight to another 200 basis points of margin expansion from our enterprise initiatives and 25% plus operating margin by the end of 2018. We're also committed to achieving organic growth of 200 basis points or more above market. 20% plus after-tax return on invested capital, free cash flow of 100% plus of net income and 12% to 14% average total shareholder returns.","Looking at the year ahead on slide 13. We're very well positioned for strong financial performance again in 2017. Today we reaffirm guidance including full year GAAP EPS in the $6 to $6.20 range with organic growth of 1.5% to 3.5%. We expect strong incremental profitability on that organic growth with core incremental margins in the 30% to 35% range. For the year, we also expect operating margin to exceed 23.5% with another 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from sourcing and 80\/20.","Free cash flow conversion is expected to exceed 100% of net income and we have allocated $1 billion of surplus capital to share repurchases. EF&C is off to a really good start. We expect revenues of about $500 million, operating margins of approximately 10%. After purchase accounting EF&C should contribute $0.02 to $0.04 of EPS. Finally for the first quarter our EPS guidance is $1.39 to $1.49, which is 12% year-over-year earnings growth at the midpoint with organic growth of 1% to 2%. In line with current levels of demand and as usual our guidance is based on current foreign exchange rate.","Okay, with that we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning guys. I think that\u2019s me. How are you doing? So Scott or Michael, since you guided 2017 as your investor day, you might agree that global economic sentiment seems to have continued to improve and certainly not good indicators of generally getting better. Your organic growth guidance includes essentially no improvement in macro conditions, for your segments with auto, as you said at the analyst day getting worse or at least conservatively you have a build down. So, do you think at this point we should look at least at the low end of your 1.5% to 3.5% organic growth range is a bit conservative given we could see some improvements from your investor related businesses. How do you plan on that now?","E. Scott Santi","Well, my response would be that we are applying you know the same approaches to our forecast and that we always have and that\u2019s that we deal with current run rates. So our forecast is absolutely 100% based on current rates projected through the year. I would certainly agree that the sediment if you will, has gotten a bit better. But I think it's really your job is to apply whatever sort of macro forecast that you see ahead to our results what we are giving you is based on actual real demand. In our businesses today how does that project through the year? I would as we said many times, we've gone through four years of work here without a lot of headwind in terms of any help from the marketplace, so we would love to see it. Pick up absolutely, but until it actually is in the businesses our approach is to deal with reality as it exists today.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Understood. And did you see any improvement in December through January, so far in any of the businesses or it's kind of just steady as she goes there?","E. Scott Santi","I think fourth quarter was right on track. First quarter, early January also looks solidly on track.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, Scott, so can I ask you about welding. If I remember correctly about 10% of the business or so are delivered in gas. You talked about the split, basically it looks oil and gas got a little bit better. But it doesn\u2019t seem like it's responded that much yet to the upstream oil and gas environment getting better. Certainly your heavy equipment seems, same as last quarter maybe a little worse. So I\u2019m a little surprised that welding hasn't shown any signs of improvement. Have you seen anything there? And do you expect maybe oil and gas to start to improve from here?","E. Scott Santi","I think, I'll go back to what Michael said in his remarks, which is we've seen pretty solid floor [ph] for the last three quarters and I think that in and of itself as \u2013 I would consider that to be modestly encouraging. I think we're a ways away from, I mean, I don\u2019t know about ways away, but I think we haven't seen anything in terms of and what I would describe is a noticeable uptick from there. But it sits now three quarters of pretty firm stable bottom, which is always the first part of any turnaround. So again hopeful that things start to improve there, but nothing we\u2019re seeing yet.","Andrew Kaplowitz","All right. Thanks for that Scott.","Operator","The next question we have coming from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","John Inch","How did Europe do overall, Scott and Michael, 3M called out a better Europe, they talked about. I know you\u2019re a big company in Germany, they talked about three quarters of kind of improving results in Germany. What are you guys seeing there?","Michael M. Larsen","Well, John, this is Michael here. I mean, the big driver of the 3% growth in Europe is the automotive business as you might expect. So I'm not sure we are really good proxy for what's going on in terms of the broader macro environment, but our automotive business as you saw what's up 8% in Europe and that's where the main driver of the 3% growth this quarter.","John Inch","Well, you\u2019re also a big construction company in Europe, has that shown any sort of trend one way or another?","E. Scott Santi","Construction has been pretty stable, but positive in Europe and was up by 3% in the fourth quarter.","John Inch","All right. And then I wanted to ask you going back to welding, so the government is looking to prospectively approve more pipeline activity. What is the nature of Miller's exposure to pipelines? And is that obviously not a short-term, but is it a longer term opportunity because you obviously are big player in North America, right, but what about the pipeline aspect of this?","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, I would say we've got a pretty reasonable position there. Overall oil and gas for welding is roughly 15% of revenue and that includes pipeline, upstream, downstream, refining, construction, offshore et cetera and I think our exposures are pretty balanced though, certainly any uptick in activity in terms of pipeline construction would surely be incrementally favorable to us.","John Inch","Your European welding businesses is also heavily oil and gas. The stabilization\/MRO sort of slow that you've seen improving in the upstream improvement. If you were to look at your oil and gas welding, vertical kind of regionally, right, and I'm just thinking of Europe because it may be a good proxy. Has Europe \u2013 have there been any signs of life in that business going back to the premise of you know when do you start to see welding turn. Because I think Scott you have made comments before that you thought there was a fairly robust pent up demand kind of more broadly in welding, given what\u2019s happened the last couple of years. Is there anything [indiscernible] from that?","Michael M. Larsen ","Sure. I\u2019d still agree with that statement and that\u2019s just based on our historical participation in this market going back to the early 90s. You know usually come out of these down cycles there is a lot of demand and recoveries are pretty robust. This one has been particularly, noteworthy decline. At this point, what I would say about Europe and our welding business is the first thing is it's a pretty small piece of the overall welding business, so I'm not sure how indicative it is in terms of overall oil and gas activity. Our big oil and gas positions are North American and China. Welding Europe was down about the same percentage on a full year basis. As the overall business down about 9%, so I think, A; given our relatively small position in Europe, not a great indicator of overall macro oil and gas and B; we haven't really seen any change over there.","John Inch","Just lastly is there any price change in welding given the sort of the collapse in the oil and gas market. So now we're probably at the trough, and we\u2019ve had three quarters of sequential stability. What's going on with price in that business? So in other words when it comes back, 3\/9.11 of the world price more aggressively kind of taken your variable contribution away or what do you feel guys telling on price? Thank you.","E. Scott Santi","Well, like it's been very stable over the course of the last four quarters. We talked before about our overall mix tilting very heavily towards the more value-added components of the welding product portfolio, if you will. So from the standpoint of our overall exposure to pricing pressure, I think we're in pretty good shape there. As I said it's not been \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen any evidence of any downward trends of any, at any meaningful level over the last four quarters.","John Inch","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question we have is coming from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","I'm not familiar with EF&C so I apologize to those on the phone who are. But can you tell us kind of what's the plan on how you get that 10% margin up or is this the turnaround story with some low hanging fruit that is a manufacturing cost, is it something else that give you some confidence, you can get this thing up to, kind of your type of margins over time?","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, well it is simply an 80\/20 application sort. You know we have an existing business operating at mid-20s EBIT margins applying 80\/20 you know very effectively and so I wouldn't call it a turnaround, it's a very good business, very well positioned. It has absolutely all the same characteristics in terms of value-add content, niche in their approach as our legacy business. It's just a function of going through the process of adding the 80\/20 management process to all the sort of great raw material and great operating capability that already exists in that business. That is not a quick fix, that's typically 3 year to 5 year process, so the plan is, I think the entry margins were 7 and so we\u2019ve talked about before is going from 7% to 20% over a five year period.","Scott Davis","Is the gross margin comparable to kind of what your business\u2019 gross margin was before you fixed your own internal business?","E. Scott Santi","Yeah I would offer that we have some very well developed diagnostics around applicability in fit for 80\/20 and all of the raw materials there and then some.","Scott Davis","Okay, that's all I had. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have is coming from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie ","Thanks, good morning everyone. So maybe sorry Michael can you parse out the price cost this quarter, I know it was negative in total, but how much pricing did you guys get and what was the cost impact this quarter?","Michael M. Larsen","Yeah, so what you're seeing Joe, is price was a fundamentally unchanged, nothing has changed in terms of our ability to get price. The difference, the 10 basis points is really as a result of increase in raw material prices specifically metal and resins in a few of our segments. But just to put it in context, the difference between flat price cost, which is our assumption for the year in 2017 which is unchanged and down 10 basis points is $3 million. So on total, relative to total operating income this quarter of $742 million. So I just wanted to put in context for you and again, I mean, price cost has not been a big favorable margin driver for us and we don't expect it to be a big headwind for 2017.","E. Scott Santi","And just to add a clarifying point, sourcing benefit is communicated in the enterprise initiatives and this is the normal.","Michael M. Larsen","Yeah, the key driver obviously, remains as I said in the prepared remarks of our margin expansion is the enterprise initiatives, so that's 80\/20 and the sourcing efforts that contributed 130 basis points this quarter and for the year.","Joe Ritchie","That makes sense. Maybe shifting gears a little bit, Auto OEM and the margin expansion this quarter, it was much better than we anticipated over 300 basis points EF&C. Can you guys just give us a little bit more color? Clearly the enterprise initiatives are working there, but what else kind of drove the stronger margin performance in auto OEM?","E. Scott Santi","If you go to, Joe, the, there\u2019s slide in the appendix of the press release that lays out the drivers of the operating margin by segment and in total. And really as you point out the operating leverage was 100 basis points enterprise initiatives about 160 basis points. Then EF&C diluted by 220 basis points, restructuring and other was slightly lower, 60 basis points so overall 100 basis points of total operating margin change on the core business. I just wanted you know so the better proxy for where this business is operating I think is the, if you look at the full year for 2016 on slide 8, 24.1% that includes 160 basis points of EF&C so 25.7% EBIT margins in the core business in automotive in 2016 with room to improve from here.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. And maybe if I can sneak one more in here, I saw that commercial in North America was down 3, are you starting to see any pressure in that business, just from an end market standpoint or anything notable that occurred this quarter?","E. Scott Santi","No, no that's just \u2013 it can be a little lumpy in construction and that's really it, I mean, like I said the better way to look at is the 4% growth for the year. As a good proxy for what 2017 might look like.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","All right. The next question we have is coming from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open","Nigel Coe","Yeah, thanks good morning. Just obviously, you talk about, Scott, you mentioned in your opening remarks, about how there still, a lot of runway from end price initiatives, you got 25% are in target. I\u2019m just wondering obviously the early stages was dominated by the business transformation structural organizational changes. I think then the sourcing was meant to kind of like pick up like towards the back end of the plan. I\u2019m just wondering how you view the major drivers of further margin expansion between organizational PLS and sourcing?","E. Scott Santi ","Well, what we talked about back in December was from the sourcing standpoint. We think we've got at least another couple of years of work in opportunity in front of us in terms of additional structural changes for the benefit of the company. At some point it becomes a much more of maintenance activity, but we've got a solid pipeline of targets in activity going on. So there's at least a couple of years worth of work, an opportunity there. Likewise from an 80\/20 perspective our efforts to reapply this sort of the current version of 80\/20 inside ITW that we talked about again back in December where we\u2019ve completely reengineered the process and are very focused on executing it to its full potential. There's at least a couple of years worth of work there.","I think the best way I can characterize and then on top of it, is as we expect further organic acceleration at you know solid 35% incremental all that gives us room to run this out for you at least the next couple of years, if not longer. We\u2019ve also talked about the fact that this is, we\u2019re operating at levels today that we didn't see as even within our scope of potential four years ago, so this has been a process of the deeper we go, the more opportunity we find. I think we've got the ability to sort of plan and execute on sort of sequential to your parents or your time horizons given what we have visibility of. But I you know I would rule out the fact that, now that we\u2019re in, we\u2019re going to find some more opportunity and that\u2019s really been the way this has been playing out.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Again, going back to December, it doesn\u2019t feel like there's a huge change in the way you\u2019re viewing capital allocations between share buybacks and M&A. But I thought the comment you gave to Scott is comment about EF&C, what\u2019s driving that margin is that applying A22 [ph] to that structure. So I\u2019m just wondering why wouldn\u2019t that principle apply to other opportunities, given that you're running well ahead of where some of your competitors are? Why wouldn\u2019t kind of the pendulum swings towards more M&A. Do you have confidence that you can run businesses better than your competitors?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think running them better is one thing, growing them is another. I think that's really been you know, that's the big delta in terms of M&A fits. We didn\u2019t buy EF&C because we can improve the margins. We bought EF&C because it extends, in our view in a very meaningful way our organic growth potential in the Automotive segment. The margin improvement - the ability improve margins it's certainly through 80\/20 is an important part of the equation. But I would view that as more risk mitigation on return on investment. It's not the core reason we buy. You know we can buy a lot of things and work really hard for five years improving the operating margins, but ultimately if we can't grow them when we're done doing that at a rate that's consistent with what we're trying to do get done here it becomes counterproductive and creates a lot of complexity.","Nigel Coe","Yeah, that's good answer. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","I know you talked about stable demand, but if market demand supports faster organic growth through the year you know let's say above that 3.5% upper end of organic guidance. All else equal, would you expect short-term core incrementals to exceed the upper end of guidance, you know that 30% to 35%. Or could you pivot and reinvest in the core business at a faster rate?","E. Scott Santi","I think, Andy, as we talked about in December that that incremental margin of 30% to 35% already includes all the investment that we want to make in our businesses, so that's a sustainable rate on a go forward basis and it\u2019s a by-product of the way we run the business, it's not a target that we drive to with intention.","Andy Casey","Sure. I'm just wondering if given that outlook, if you kind of have a reinvestment budget in mind. If the actual end market growth exceeds the outlook, does the upper end of that core incremental start to exceed 35% in the short-term?","E. Scott Santi ","They might. Yeah and it's not because we\u2019re holding back investment, I think the point that we want to make sure is clear, is that we are fully invested and continue to improve the productivity and accelerate the organic growth of these businesses. When Michael talks about our capital allocation, he talk about that as our first priority. So it's not like we're saying, we\u2019re only going to do so much because we can afford to do more, it's that we are \u2013 its only so much you can do, particularly through the lens of quality investment and things that drive results at ITW. All that gets prioritized as the first priority with regard to our capital allocation. There\u2019s not, just because things are better than our forecasting scenario, there\u2019s not a bunch of things we wish we could do that we're not doing that we\u2019ll all of a sudden turn on, that\u2019s not, it's just not how it works here. So I think in the short run faster growth is certainly going to have the potential to have higher incrementals.","Andy Casey","Okay, thanks a lot, Scott. And then one additional thing, I know you talked about stability in the quarter and so far in January. In addition to some of these sentiment indices, other companies have talked about kind of, you know some catch-up demand during the quarter where the post-election environment in the U.S. might have been a little bit better than the pre-election. Did you see any of that sort of inflection? I know it could just be a temporary phenomenon. I just wondered if you guys saw any of that?","E. Scott Santi","No, I think the simple sort of way to look at the quarter from a demand standpoint is all the segments we\u2019re on trend, we thought of being a little bit better.","Michael M. Larsen","Yeah and I\u2019d just add, Andy, if you look at the monthly very similar in 2016 to 2015 and prior years, so nothing unusual.","Andy Casey ","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Maybe trying to ask the prior question a little bit differently. If I'm looking at North America, I know you talked about it throughout 2016. In the first three quarters, North America has grown for you anywhere between 0.5% to 2% and you were flat in the fourth quarter. So wondering if there are some comps issue here or anything like that? How do you think about North America in 2017 within the context of your 1.5 to 3.5 organic guidance?","Michael M. Larsen","This is Mike. I mean, the delta in Q4 relative to Q3 and year-to-date growth rates was really have Test & Measurement had a big Q3 as you recall, up 7% and was down slightly in North America, so that's really what tipped the scale here in Q4. I think in terms of 2017, if you took at current run rates, we still expect low single digit type growth in North America.","Mig Dobre","But if I may tease this out a little bit, do you think that North America is going to be towards kind of the low end of that organic guidance or towards the higher end of that organic guidance?","Michael M. Larsen ","Well, so we don't give guidance by geography and we give guidance on current run rate sentiment. It\u2019s certainly more positive, we acknowledge and we\u2019ve talked automotive as a little bit of a wildcard in terms of the outlook for the year, but overall we feel very good going into 2017.","Mig Dobre","Okay, great. Then my follow-up, maybe you can comment a little bit on your geographic balance from a manufacturing standpoint. Are you net exporter or importer out of the U.S.? Are you making any sort of changes to your manufacturing strategy, given all the talk that's out there on policy changes?","E. Scott Santi ","Yeah, the overall answer to that is that we have been a produce where we sell company for a long, long time and none of what's out there in the conversation right now would have any impact in terms of our, any changes in that. We are roughly a modest net exporter from North America to the tune of 4% to 5% of revenue. So pretty balanced in terms of, I think that supports what I\u2019ve just said, we are largely producing where our customers are. We do that not because it's low cost, but because it's the most efficient way to serve our customers around the world and it is something that has served us very well and I don't see that changing regardless of any changes in some of the rules in trade policies, et cetera.","Mig Dobre","Great. Thank you guys.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now.","Ann Duignan","Can you talk a little bit about as you enter 2017, which of your businesses are achieving the 200 basis points above market growth? Obviously, Automotive is one of those. And which are you most concerned about are working hard just went to accomplish that 200 bps above market?","Michael M. Larsen","Well, I think there are a number of businesses that, first let me just answer the enterprise level. I think, if you look at our performance in 2016 relative to peers or relative to market at the enterprise level we would certainly argue that we grew above market in 2016. If you just look at the performance by business, certainly automotive as you mentioned grew above market. Food Equipment overall, grew above market, we\u2019ve talked about the service fees there, but certainly on the equipment side. I would put Test & Measurement, probably in line with market into 2016. Polymers & Fluids; Polymers, show some PLS activity. In 2016 construction specialty right in line with market.","Ann Duignan","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And on the construction side what specifically do you think you need to do to get benefits outperforming because it is a very [indiscernible].","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, I think the big part of the agenda there's, we still got a decent percentage of not ready to do businesses primarily in Europe, we're still working on restructuring our European businesses over there. We made a lot of progress in that regard in 2016. And would expect to get through the bulk of that probably by the end of 2017. But North America, the business is performing pretty well and certainly is \u2013 the bulk of the agenda now in our North American construction business is centered around consulting organic growth and I think we're really well positioned to do that. But we got Europe straightened away.","Ann Duignan","Okay, and that\u2019s been pretty consistent, I think. Just a quick follow-up on the metals and resin price increases. I'm assuming Polymer includes the segment most impacted by resin, which of the businesses, has been impacted by our metal prices. I know you said that\u2019s them, not very material, but still it is a rising risk?","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, you're right, I mean, we think this is very manageable, I mean Automotive, Food would be the primary ones, steel prices. Then also on the welding side, a little bit, but again it's not, our business units are all over this. We have a pretty good track record of managing the price cost equation. As a reminder we\u2019re not trying to generate, price significantly above inflation. We\u2019re just trying to cover our costs and I think we've done a pretty good job with that historically.","Ann Duignan","Probably just one, the first quarter since we could find where it was a negative. So I think it just caused some of [indiscernible]?","E. Scott Santi","We talked a little bit about it in December, right, that we wouldn't be surprised if we saw some headwind on the price cost equation for a quarter or two until we get a chance to kind of respond. Then I would just point out, like I said, earlier we're talking about the difference between neutral and 10 basis points is $3 million out of $742 million of operating income in the quarter. So, I wouldn't get too alarmed.","Ann Duignan","Fair point, okay I\u2019ll get back in line. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Just to follow-up on North American growth in 2017. Would you expect the growth to start-off the year slower given the tough comp you mentioned in construction in Q1, I assume that construction comp it was driven by North America? And then would you see acceleration expected starting already in Q2?","E. Scott Santi","As you know Steven, the forecasting business, I mean, we said 1% to 2% for overall enterprise growth in the first quarter that's a little bit below where we are for the year. So the improvement in the growth rate in the second half of 2017 is really based on comps. Comps getting a little bit easier, so that's how I would position it and that's all this is at current run rates.","Steven Fisher","Okay. I was just trying to have the expectation that if we see a soft North America in Q1, that\u2019s kind of within your expectations. It sounds like it would be, but just on expectation.","Michael M. Larsen ","Yeah, well, that's right. Yeah, that's right and then primarily, I mean, the comp in construction \u2013","E. Scott Santi ","It\u2019s all relative to comp.","Michael M. Larsen","Yeah, I mean, the comp in construction, that up 11%, that\u2019s a tough one, so you're right.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Then how sensitive is your buyback programs, to level of the stock price or will it be entirely independent there. I mean, you doubled your plan buyback at the beginning of last year, which I assume is partly because the stock was down was up. But actually we think about the judgment that we apply, that, we don\u2019t have $2 billion of cash flow expected here, only 1 billion of buyback.","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, I mean, the stock wasn\u2019t really down last year. I mean, the average for the year is 107, so $2 million at an average of 107. And we\u2019ve talked about this before, I mean, we really are in the market on a continuous basis and so this year we have planned it as $250 a quarter, similar to what we did last year. If we were able to the extent that there is a market correction, we certainly have the ability to step in and do a little bit more. But fundamentally the way we think about it is we have a business model here that over the long-term can generate 12% to 14% TSR. Over the long-term that will be reflected we believe in the value of the company and so on and that's how we approach the share buyback program. And it\u2019s really our way to return incremental surplus capital to shareholder business, if there is not an alternative, got to learn some use of that cash other than we could sit on it.","Michael M. Larsen","That's right, $1 billion that we have allocated in 2017 is our best estimate of the surplus capital available in North America and so that's. Once we're done with that everything, we talked about the internal investments, dividends, acquisitions that need a set of criteria, with the remainder of the surplus capital then allocated to the share buyback program. Just going to add one other clarification which was the incremental 1 million that we had last year was to some repatriation that we were able to do, it wasn\u2019t related to share price, which was up 35% once. Just to point that out.","Steven Fisher","That's perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","guess two quick questions. One, I mean everyone's tried the question of whether we've seen improvement in demand post-election and you\u2019ve said no. You have referenced better sort of sentiment out there? When you're talking sentiment is that because you're specifically talking to your customers and they're telling you they feel better or are you just watching the stock market and the broader new. I'm just wondering if it's stuff you're reading or stuff you\u2019re hearing from your customers? Then my second question assuming North America does get better at some point. Is there a difference, should we think about North America, is the profitability, I guess, across the different geographies similar now? Or is North America generally have more profitable businesses you know based on what you've done with the enterprise initiatives I don't know if that's - you know the profit by geographies changed at all? Thank you.","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, I\u2019ll take the first one and let Michael talk about the second. In terms of the sentiment, I would say it's all of the above. In other words, it's what we read is what our customers talk about, but I'm not sure our customers are doing anything other than reacting to what they're reading, who they're talking to so. As we've talked before, it's I don't think there's any secret that the overall mood seems to be modestly better. Whether that translates into anything meaningful in terms of demand that remains to be seen in terms of our planning. It\u2019s as we said many times we're going to set ourselves up to execute well in the environment as it exists today and certainly be in a position to continue to do so, whichever way the market moves.","Michael M. Larsen","Then, Jamie, your question on margins in North America, they are very consistent across all three geographies at ITW, so we could choose different than it was five years.","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, absolutely and I think there's - if you look at, so the average of the company is about 23% now that's fairly consistent in North America and Europe as well as, Asia Pacific. Obviously, we have on a relative basis more exposure in North America, about 50% of our sales are in North America, but the margins are the same.","Jamie Cook","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Walter Liptak","I wanted to ask one about the Food Equipment business and there has been some volatility around some of the restaurants and questions about CapEx. I know you guys have a lot of institutional or are you seeing the same kind of volatility to or same concern on either side.","Michael M. Larsen","This is Michael, so institution was really strong in the fourth quarter, you saw Equipment up 9 in North America. Restaurants maybe a little slow early in the quarter, but then picked up in November, December and really stable demand. Then the third piece, I\u2019d just add our retail business, also a solid growth on that side. We haven\u2019t seen any - just look at the number, it\u2019s up 9%, anything to suggest that things are slowing down.","Walter Liptak","Well, that's great thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Your line is open.","Eli Lustgarten ","A couple of follow-on questions since we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground; one, the 100 basis points improvement in profitability. I mean, can you give us an idea where to expect more to come from and I assume welding is going to have difficulty holding its margins collections for \u2013 showing much improvement in 2017 versus 2016. Give us some idea where the probability change we expect across the segments?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I mean, the best answer, Eli, I can give you that we would expect to see improvement in all of our segments as we continue to execute on the enterprise strategy, so.","Eli Lustgarten","Anyone else besides welding that would be more challenged in 2017, I think welding will be challenged this year?","E. Scott Santi","I don't think we would share that view. I think welding has done a nice job, sustaining margins with a lot of downward pressure on revenue. Certainly, has more room to run in terms of enterprise initiatives.","Michael M. Larsen","Welding will be part of the \u2013","E. Scott Santi ","Yeah, I mean, look at welding margins this year, right, and big improvement again in Q4, up 190 basis points and 210 basis points of that was from enterprise initiatives. So \u2013","Eli Lustgarten","Are you talking about a business that\u2019s down peak to trough, more than 20 percent.","E. Scott Santi","Yeah.","Eli Lustgarten","15 days, you announced the formation of the integrated electronic assembly equipment division and you made some changes. I assume maybe handicap, what can we expect out of that consolidation, I assume there\u2019s no improvement for changes in the past 2017 forecast, but even some handicap of what we might be able to do for the segments and improving that?","E. Scott Santi","I think from your perspective Eli, it\u2019s not going to do anything, so this is more of a natural outcome of continuing to simplify these businesses and structures and the final phases of business structure simplification, so doesn't do anything in terms of the overall results that we're looking at here.","Eli Lustgarten","Just one on automotive, with the slowdown of production is, are there any changes in the automotive spending habits or spending that you\u2019re hearing across the board, particularly in North America, where they just \u2013 this is what adjustments and factored and your penetration will offset it.","E. Scott Santi","I think it's been pretty stable I think there are some forecasts out for some slowing in North America in the back half of the year. But in terms of what we're seeing right now and you could see the numbers. Q4 was strong, we\u2019re telling Q1 is in solid shape. Certainly, we\u2019re aware of some of the expectations, but nothing coming through for our customers at this point.","Eli Lustgarten","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","All right. The last question we had on the line is \u2013 coming from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","First, just a clarification on some of the welding in oil and gas comments that the stabilization that you\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, are you seeing it similarly in the North America onshore markets as you are in the offshore markets. I think you know some encouraging signs recently in the onshore markets, but just want to get a sense of whether or not you think both onshore and offshore have bottomed at this point.","E. Scott Santi","We participate in all those markets, I don't have the data right in front of me to answer your question with a great level of detail. So I'll just go back to what we said earlier, overall demand is stable in that business including on the oil and gas side so.","Joe O'Dea","Then just one on some potential policy and you commented on this past year taking advantage of some repatriation to take up the buyback. If you do find that there is policy that enables you to access. A lot of cash that is overseas, is share repurchase the most likely avenue for that? Or are there other capital deployment sides of it that we should be thinking about.","E. Scott Santi","Yeah, I think it's a little too early to tell. I think that policy in that area is still evolving and trying to guess where it might end up, I don't think would be prudent. We have about, a little more than $2 billion of capital overseas. If we bring some of that back, it would go into the surplus capital category and we would kind of look into the options at that point, but again it's hard to say anything really insightful given the uncertainty in this area.","Joe O'Dea","Very fair. Thanks very much.","Operator","At this time speakers, not showing further questions on queue.","Michael M. Larsen","Okay. Great. Thank you for joining us and have a good day.","E. Scott Santi","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may disconnect at this time."],"11433":["Illinois Tool Works, Inc.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at any point.","And I would like to turn the call now to your host Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Larsen","Hi, thank you, Gary. And good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s third quarter 2016 conference call. I\u2019m Michael Larsen, ITW\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO; and joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.","During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our third quarter 2016 financial results and update you on our 2016 earnings forecast.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2015 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016 for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. And while we use very few non-GAAP measures a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Santi","Thanks, Michael, and good morning. In Q3 ITW delivered another quarter of high-quality earnings growth with record operating income, operating margin and return on invested capital performance.","In the quarter we generated 8% GAAP earnings per share growth, operating margin of 23.1% which if you exclude the 80 basis points of EF and CE acquisition dilution, it was 23.9% on an apples-to-apples basis. And after-tax return on invested capital came in at 23%.","The key driver of our performance continues to be the execution of our strategy. The third quarter marked the 12th quarter in a row that our enterprise strategy initiatives delivered more than 100 basis points of margin expansion.","In addition, we\u2019re continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth with six of our seven segments again delivering positive organic growth in Q3 despite a macro environment that obviously remains challenging.","Through the execution of our strategy, we have grown earnings per share by an average of 15% per year over the last four years with almost no help from the market environment. But we still have ways to before we are operating to our full potential. We look forward to providing an update on the work that we have ahead of us to deliver on ITW\u2019s full-performance potential at our annual Investor Day in December.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q3 performance and our updated Q4 2016 forecast. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Scott. ITW\u2019s third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow.","EPS was up 8% to $1.50 slightly ahead of the mid-points of our guidance due to solid execution and the resulting better margin performance.","Total revenue was $3.5 billion up 4% and organic growth was 2% in-line with guidance. Overall demand was pretty steady state as we move through the quarter, and what continues to be a fairly challenging environment particularly on the capital equipment side. Nevertheless, six or seven segments delivered positive organic growth in key regions such as North America, Europe, Asia Pacific including China were all positive.","In my opinion, the highlight of this quarter was ITW\u2019s record operating margin performance of 23.1% - 23.9% when you exclude EF&C, and all seven segments performing above 21%.","Operating income grew 6% to $808 million and after-tax return on invested capital improved to 140 basis points to 23%. Both of these performance metrics were all-time highs for ITW.","We invested more than $150 million in capital equipment, new products and projects to simplify our businesses.","Free cash flow of 101% on the income was a little lower than last year due to some quarterly timing but year-to-date we\u2019re on track at 94% which compares to 96% at this point last year. We typically have a strong Q4 and we expect to finish the year above 100%.","In addition, we repurchased shares for $500 million and expect to complete this year\u2019s program with another $500 million in Q4 bringing the total to $2 billion. Finally, as we saw in August, ITW announced a dividend increase of 18%.","So, overall, pretty straight-forward, good quarter as ITW continue to execute well and deliver strong results.","On slide 5, starting with the key drivers of our operating margin performance, the strong execution of our enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Price cost was slightly favorable. Volume leverage of 30 basis points was offset by a number of other items. And EF&C diluted margin 80 basis points, resulting in 23.1%, a record for the company and like I said 23.9% if you\u2019re comparing to our long-term performance growth of 23% plus.","On page 6, really good operating performance across the seven segments, with all segments at or above 21% for the first time ever.","I wanted to point out that automotive OEM margins as expected were diluted 370 basis points by EF&C and that the core business is obviously still very strong at 25% plus. In construction, restructuring related to the simplification of our European manufacturing footprint created a drag of 190 basis points. The other segment numbers speak for themselves, really strong performance again this quarter.","Turning to the segment discussion and starting with our automotive OEM, a really good quarter on the top-line as organic revenue grew 7% due to strong penetration gains in every region.","In North America, 5% organic growth compares favorably to Auto-builds of 2% and that includes a 1% decline at the so called D3 where we have relatively higher content. Europe was up 5% with 700 basis points of penetration gains, as overall builds were down 2%. And China was up 40% with very significant penetration gains due to new product launches this quarter.","Also, you may recall that China was down 5% in this quarter last year making for relatively easy comparisons.","Food Equipment was up 1% organically with North America equipment up 3% due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall that in the third quarter last year, equipment was up 8%. International equipment was down 3% and service was up 1%.","Based on Q3 exit run rates and backlog and a more normalized comparison, we expect that Q4 organic growth rate to be more in line with recent trends, so continued solid demand in Food Equipment.","Also continued strong margin performance and 27.4% was the highest margin in the company this quarter. A good quarter for Test & Measurement in electronics as organic revenue grew 7% due primarily to an easy comparison. Last year in the third quarter of this segment was down 11%.","Electronics was up 13% and Test & Measurement was up 1% in what continues to be a fairly sluggish capital investment demand environment. However, the solid margin expansion is really encouraging and something we\u2019ve talked about on this call before.","Margin improved 440 basis points to 21% with 190 basis points from enterprise initiatives and the balance primarily from volume leverage.","While the demand environment in welding is stable, it is still pretty challenging as evidenced by the 9% decline in year-over-year revenues. The decline breaks down as 4 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining and then 2 points from commercial.","The brighter story; is on the margin front and as the welding team continues to do an excellent job managing the cost structure through this cycle by preserving our strong position in the marketplace and being ready to fully participate as things eventually turn around.","Despite peak-to-trough revenues being down about 20%, operating margin is 26.5% this quarter, which, is only 150 basis points below peak margins. In the third quarter, benefits from enterprise initiatives and the restructuring projects we talked about last quarter contributed 240 basis points to margin expansion.","As we said before our welding segment remains a good example of how resilient the ITW business model is across a wide range of economic scenarios.","Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 1%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was down 1% mostly due to lower demand on the industrial MRO side of the business. Margin improved 200 basis points to 21% driven by initiatives and restructuring savings.","Demand in construction products held pretty steady this quarter as this segment grew 2% organically. Construction also had a challenging comparison to last year when North America was up 7%. This quarter, North America was up 1% as compared to down 1% in Q2, and this quarter commercial grew 5%, renovation and remodeling was up 4%, and residential was down slightly 1 point.","Asia-Pacific was up 2%, New York was pretty good up 2% but below the Q2 growth rates of 7% and 6% respectively. And we talked about the margins 24.5% in construction if you exclude the European simplification project this quarter.","Finally, specialty products, organic revenue was essentially flat with international up 3%, and North America down slightly. Our consumer packaging consumable businesses in this segment are growing solidly offset by weaker demand on the capital equipment side.","Good progress on the margin side with an increase of 210 basis points to 26.1% driven by 180 basis points from enterprise initiatives.","Turning to page 10, our updated guidance for 2016. As you saw this morning we\u2019re raising the mid-point of our full-year EPS guidance and narrowing the range to 556 to 566 which represents 9% earnings growth at the mid-point.","As usual, we\u2019re assuming current foreign exchange rates which given the recent strengthening of the dollar against the pound and the Euro creates a few pennies of currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter. As a result, this full-year guidance increased of the penny is essentially the $0.03 beep from the third quarter partially offset by $0.02 of additional currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter at today\u2019s foreign exchange rates.","We expect full-year 2016 operating margin to be above 22.5%, a new full-year record for the company and up from 21.4% last year. Keep in mind that EF&C dilutes full-year margin by approximately 50 basis points. In other words, excluding EF&C, we would be talking about approximately 23% operating margin for the year.","For the fourth quarter, as usual, our forecast assumes Q3 exit run rates which equates to organic growth of zero to 2%. And embedded in that organic growth forecast is a steady state demand assumption that we feel is pretty reasonable in light of the relatively stable demand trends across our business portfolio in Q3.","We expect operating margin of approximately 21.5% which is greater than 22% when you exclude EF&C which compares to 20.7% in Q4 last year, so continued strong margin expansion in Q4.","Finally, EPS guidance is $1.31 to $1.41 which is, 11% earnings growth at the mid-point marking a pretty strong finish to the year.","So, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we\u2019ll now open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir, thank you speakers. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question, it\u2019s from Mr. John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir.","John Inch","Thank you, good morning everyone. Guys, international Food Equipment softness I guess was consistent with Lennox\u2019s comments. I\u2019m wondering if we could get little more color on that what you\u2019re seeing. I remember sort of the call or the commentary around restaurants which were softer I believe it was about, I think restaurants are about 15% of your mix maybe if you could just sort of put the international softness in the restaurant issue sort of into a context for us?","Michael Larsen","Yes, so John, I would just, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into this quarter in Food Equipment, as you know the quarter trends can bounce around a little bit. I think if you look at the year-to-date numbers up in that 3% to 4% range we expect to end up in the same place in Q4 and for the full year.","I think Food Equipment more broadly we continue to see strength on the institutional side which is the majority of our business particularly in refrigeration and then on the scale side and the retail business but really nothing to be too concerned about in terms of the demand environment pretty stable as we went through the quarter and we\u2019ll be back on trend in Q4.","John Inch","Okay. So, the international, you\u2019re describing it more as a bullet versus some sort of beginning of a trend, is that a fair statement?","Michael Larsen","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","John Inch","Okay. And then Test & Measurement and Electronics, I think some people don\u2019t fully appreciate what\u2019s in the Electronics segment. And I make the commentary in the context that 3M and others have experienced consumer electronics weakness. In their situation it\u2019s all that conversion and Smartphone saturation. And I guess I\u2019m wondering are you experiencing any kind of consumer softness within the confines of the umbrella of this Electronics up 13% organically?","Scott Santi","Our exposures there really have fallen into two buckets. One is and largely clean-room MRO collection of businesses, that\u2019s a pretty steady Eddie business. And then the other piece which is where we saw some of the big driver of the year-on-year growth improvement was really on the Equipment side so we\u2019re producing equipment that people use to produce circuit boards.","And that business again Michael talked about it was up somewhat in the quarter but also on a very low comp on the prior year. So I think we would not describe that business as being down significantly or being under pressure but it\u2019s also I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into the year-on-year growth number either.","John Inch","That\u2019s fair. And then just lastly, you Auto strength in China, Michael you attributed to product launches. Is this a one-quarter phenomenon or are you gearing up to try and penetrate the China Auto sector, like, do this have more legs beyond the quarter I guess is what I\u2019m wondering.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think this has a lot more legs to it as we go forward and into next year and beyond. Obviously 40% - builds were up 20% plus. But in terms of kind of what the penetration gains can be, I think that\u2019s directional, that\u2019s where we would expect it to be going forward.","John Inch","And, that 2X numbers, is that what you\u2019re saying?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think that\u2019s doable. Based on the new products and what\u2019s in the pipeline yes.","John Inch","All right. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And therefore next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. The line is open, sir.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good morning guys.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie","In your next fundamental quarter maybe just focusing on Auto, since there seems to be a lot of concern out there right now giving potentially peaking Auto-builds and Ford\u2019s comments about idling capacity. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the D3 was down 1, but the out-growth in North America was still really strong. And so maybe just provide a little bit more color on where you\u2019re seeing the out-growth and expectation longer-term to continue to outgrow Auto production?","Scott Santi","We\u2019ve talked about this a number of times in the past. On the Auto business for us is one where we do have a reasonable amount of forward visibility typically two to three years. So we have, we feel very good about our pipeline of new content going on new vehicles. Certainly we will be impacted on a relative basis based on the overall build levels in the market but our ability to continue to outgrow whatever the market growth rate is. If it flattens out we would still expect it to be positive by 200 to 400 basis points.","And that\u2019s pretty much a three-year kind of look. We\u2019ve got some great backlogs and great programs in place and a lot of really compelling things we\u2019re working on. So it\u2019s an area that we are very bullish on, on a long-term basis.","Michael Larsen","And I would just add Joe, specifically to the D3 being down 1, the expectations is for them to be down again in Q4. And that\u2019s fully embedded in our forecast. And I think similar to, in food you\u2019ll see a growth rate in line with what we\u2019ve done historically on the Auto side here in Q4.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe touching base on the margins on Auto, I know you guys are under consistent pricing pressure but at the same time can - you really get a lot of production efficiency to help continue to grow margins in that segment.","Given that it\u2019s longer-cycle, maybe have a little bit more visibility on Auto. I\u2019m just curious, kind of compare and contract Auto versus welding because you\u2019ve done such a great job at continuing to expand margins in your welding segment despite a roll-over in growth. I\u2019m just curious how resilient you think your Auto margins can be if we do start to see a slowdown in Auto?","Scott Santi","The Auto margin still is largely about the value-add content we put in the products. So we have talked I think on a number of occasions of our business being very niche, very oriented around solving tough problems for our OEM customers. We\u2019re not planning in the bumpers on whatever model car you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re at an RFQ bidder, we\u2019re problem solver.","So, from the standpoint of the overall margin performance in that business, it largely is a function of our discipline around the types of opportunities we\u2019re going to engage yet with our customers and how well our skill-set matches up with what they need partner to do.","So, I think we\u2019re in really good shape. These are typically longer-term, six-seven-year kinds of program. And certainly there are some commitments often embedded in terms of annual cost tick-up, those are fully baked in terms of our knowledge upfront. And we would work really hard on delivering value not only in the design of the actual solution but then on an ongoing basis continue to drive benefits for customers that also drive benefits for the company.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, fair enough. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And for our next question, it\u2019s from Scott Davis from Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of when welding does come back, what type of margin structure we can expect and the question really here is that how much discretionary spend is being cut and things that you\u2019re going to have to add back pretty quickly your investment spend or how you define it I guess. But just general spend that may have to come back that would indicate that maybe even margins don\u2019t go up, when welding comes back but more flattish, just some color on that would be helpful?","Scott Santi","Your final comment would be very hard for me to see any scenario where that would be the case. We\u2019ve, the teams in welding have done a really nice job of adjusting cost structure to the overall - current demand environment. But there is nothing. We\u2019ve also been very clear and we\u2019ve worked very hard on making sure that all of our, sort of important growth investments remains fully funded throughout this down-cycle.","So, it is largely a matter of lot of reapplication of 80\/20, a lot of focus and prioritization, it\u2019s not about cutting muscle it\u2019s about adjusting the cost structures. So from a standpoint of how it looks on a go-forward basis, I would have a hard time seeing any scenario where the incremental margins on the recovery would be far outside of our traditional 30% to 35% bucket.","Scott Davis","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as follow-on, if you think in terms of some normalization in welding sequentially. I mean, when do you think you\u2019d be I know this is hard, but given that oil prices are back up over 50 in emerging markets, we\u2019re getting a bit better and such, so do you get a sense of a book-to-bill in the 1.0 or little bit better range earlier in \u201817? Or do you still think it might be more of a mid-to-later?","Scott Santi","I\u2019ll tell you what I would probably not want to give into the forecasting business here. It\u2019s been we\u2019re going up on eight quarters now, some pretty significant contraction. And we got to see it flatten out first, I would say from the standpoint of just sequential daily order rate demand transit has been pretty solid, pretty steady state for the last three or four quarters here. But it\u2019s not - we\u2019re assuming not seeing any signs of any pick up at this point. I would really hesitate to call a turn at some point in the future but we\u2019re well positioned to participate in it when it happens. And I think we\u2019re managing the business through this down-cycle pretty well.","Scott Davis","That\u2019s fair. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, it\u2019s from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Thank you. Just first a broad question. Can you set the framework for December meeting, what we should be expecting organic growth, enterprise initiatives for next year?","Scott Santi","No.","Michael Larsen","We haven\u2019t Dave, we haven\u2019t even been through our full planning cycle yet for \u201817, so that happens in November and which is always our normal routine and then we come to December well-armed with pretty good view of what we think we got to be able to accomplish in the upcoming year.","David Raso","I mean, is it fair to say given next year is officially the last year of the enterprise initiatives that yes, there is a year left of that but the meeting is going pivot more, trying to focus on can you accelerate organic growth with internal initiatives I mean, is that the?","Scott Santi","Not necessarily.","David Raso","Not, okay, that\u2019s interesting. When I think about the incremental margins you just put up, and kind of simplistically I think of it is as when you provide that organic margin change, this trade operating leverage that you provide right before any changes in variable margin overhead cost. The incremental margins were about 36%, and then obviously went higher when you added some of the enterprise initiatives.","Whatever you do provide an organic sales growth for \u201817 at that meeting. How should we be thinking about how you view your organic incremental margins right. Because we\u2019re trying to pivot away from an internal how you can keep growing these margins 100 bps a year but at some point it just gets more challenging. What can you give us on organic and what kind of leverage do you expect, just to provide some framework?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think David, consistent with what we\u2019ve said before and I think Scott just mentioned this, and when we\u2019re talking about welding is, we would expect our incremental margins to continue to be in that 30% to 35% range.","Scott Santi","That\u2019s the base rate, not.","Michael Larsen","That\u2019s the base rate that does not include the enterprise initiatives, that\u2019s correct yes.","David Raso","Most of the buckets right, whatever you think you can do on organically and obviously the pressure is on a little bit as we pivot away from the enterprise initiatives, how much can you get the ready-to-grow to show itself in fast-organic. But you still have another year of enterprise value and then again Scott, I do assume that the meeting will get some further, this progress on the idea of pivoting to the organic story?","And the capital allocation obviously you\u2019re still generating strong cash. I assume we get some clarity on how to think about the next few years? Just, I mean, I know it\u2019s hard to forecast, just the pivot from here the margin story internally to organic would always be the benefit of your strong cash flow and capital allocation. It is sort of an interesting moment for the stock\u2019s evolution, right. I mean we\u2019ll get more than just here is the \u201817 outlook. Is that fair?","Scott Santi","Yes.","David Raso","Okay, all right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, it\u2019s from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open.","Andy Kaplowitz","Hi, good morning guys. Scott, so with expected margin in Test & Measurement to improve as your enterprise initiatives continue to ramp up. Were you surprised by the speed of the margin ramp up? Is it really just new leadership this year taking a fresh look at the business and making more immediate changes than anything else? And if there is anything stopping Test & Measurement from being a mid-20% margin business, like your other businesses over time?","Scott Santi","Yes, the second answer - the answer to the second question is no. Great fundamentals in that business and I would say as with all of our seven businesses, they are in terms of the work they\u2019ve done moving through, these enterprise strategy initiatives they all started in a different place, they all had their own level of work to be done and Test & Measurement\u2019s case, there were recent progress in terms of outcome is not worthy but they\u2019ve been doing things inside that haven\u2019t necessarily showed up in terms of margin for the last six or eight quarters.","And so I\u2019m very pleased with now what\u2019s starting to show up and they\u2019ve been on a pretty good track all the way long in terms of what they\u2019ve been working on to get where they can be. And as you said, still have more room to go.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay, that\u2019s good Scott. And then just shifting to Construction, can you talk about what happened this quarter? You said BSS reduced margins by 190 basis points, but I would have thought that much of the simplification in that segment had already occurred. We know you\u2019ve been trying to simplify your European Construction footprint for some time. But the level of BSS seems a little more out of the blue I guess than I would have thought.","Scott Santi","Well, it wasn\u2019t necessarily out of the blue but there was, there are, from day one we knew that there was a lot to get down there, they\u2019ve gone through a couple of cycles. And this particular project that has certainly, have visible impact on margin in Q1 was one that has been in the planning cycle for a while.","But it was among our most complex structures in the company if you go back to - I'm talking about European Construction. And so, we\u2019ve talked in the past about not only the work we\u2019ve been doing but the way we\u2019ve been doing the work in terms of doing it in a methodical fashion in a way that doesn\u2019t impair our ability to serve our customers and generate some reasonable incremental progress along the way.","So, while this was, this particular activity was known, we knew we were going to have to do it almost back to the beginning, it\u2019s one where we also are now going to place from a standpoint of time and where we\u2019re in a position to do it and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t impact our ability to serve our customers in the region.","So, it wasn\u2019t out of the blue from our standpoint by any stretch.","Andy Kaplowitz","Scott, does the headwind from this kind of quickly go away in terms of the margin difference?","Scott Santi","Yes.","Michael Larsen","Look at welding from last quarter, I mean, our restructuring, when it is, when it tends to be that constant in a segment, we\u2019re doing it every quarter, we talked to you about the overall spend, it\u2019s typically spread pretty evenly, we even talked about it, just part of how we operate.","But in the case of welding in Q2, we talked about some fairly sizeable actions and then look at the recovery in Q3 already in terms of margin from that. So in construction this is, the expense side of these, are front-end loaded based on the accounting rules. But the benefits ultimately start to show up maybe not fully in Q4 but certainly over the next three quarters or so.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay, great. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question it\u2019s from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.","Nigel Coe","Yes, thanks. Good morning. I know you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance by segment, but just given the diversions that we saw this quarter I just wonder if you could maybe give us some help in terms of how you see the zero to 2% playing out in 4Q? I\u2019m assuming that Auto tries to maintain 7%, but any commentary in terms of that spread would be helpful.","Michael Larsen","Yes, Nigel, as you know, we and as we said, our Q4 organic growth forecast is based on the Q3 exit run rates from a demand standpoint. And really what some of the deviations from that you see are really more comparison issue than anything else. And I think you asked about automotive, if you look at the year-to-date growth rate in that 4% to 5% range, that\u2019s probably what you would expect to see given current run rates and given the comps here in the fourth quarter.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then how does that look in 4Q?","Michael Larsen","How does it look in sorry?","Nigel Coe","How does that look in 4Q?","Michael Larsen","In Test & Measurement?","Nigel Coe","Exactly, yes.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, I think Test & Measurement, the comparison is really to drive out the big 7% increase this quarter. That normalizes a little bit here in Q4, and I think you will see probably a year-over-year increase in Q4 that\u2019s in the low-single digits in Test & Measurement. And it\u2019s really driven by the continued sluggish demand for capital equipment which impacts the Test & Measurement side of that segment.","Nigel Coe","Right, right. Okay, great. And then, just a quick one on the impact of EFC in 4Q, you guided for 50 bps or thereabouts of dilution for the full year, suggests that the margin impact could be slightly greater in 4Q than 3Q. Is that correct, and if that is the case why would that be given I\u2019ve expected most of the wipe downs have happened in the 3Q as opposed to 4Q?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I\u2019m not sure how you got that Nigel I mean Q4 is going to look a lot like Q3 in terms of the EF&C impact. So you saw the margin dilution 80 basis points at the enterprise level. We\u2019d expect the same here in Q4. Revenues in Q3, $117 million which is in line with what we expected and we expect something very similar to that here in the fourth quarter.","And then finally on the EPS side, consistent with what we said before, EPS neutral in the first six months here in the second half of \u201816 and then accretive, I would expect you to be accretive as we get into \u201817 and we have to go through the planning process as Scott said and then we\u2019ll give you an update when we get to giving guidance for 2017.","Nigel Coe","Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Scott Santi","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Yes, thank you. Good morning. If we can go back to Food Equipment, I\u2019m looking at North America service and growth here over the past couple of quarters has slowed a bit after running at 4% to 5% for the last couple of years. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us any color as to what\u2019s going on here, what\u2019s driving the slowdown?","Scott Santi","I wouldn\u2019t say Mig it\u2019s a slowdown, again if you go back and look, service in North America was up 4% in Q3 last year we\u2019re up 2% this year, that\u2019s pretty solid. But we\u2019ve also talked about the fact that we think there is more potential here for organic growth, that\u2019s probably closer to what we\u2019re seeing at least on the equipment side.","Mig Dobre","I know, but I\u2019m asking really about service. And it is a slowdown from the 4% to 5% that you\u2019ve consistently put up since early 2014. And I guess my question is really going to this idea that we\u2019re starting to see that restaurant sales have slowed here, and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the driver or if it\u2019s something else?","Scott Santi","No, that\u2019s not it at all. I think if you go back and look I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve put up 4% to 5% in service since 2014. But I think going forward that\u2019s not an unrealistic expectation. I mean, services is stable here, we talked about this last quarter, also little bit of PLS in some parts of the business.","But overall, kind of been this low single-digit is a pretty good way to think about the business on a go-forward basis, from a growth standpoint. And then obviously as you know this is a very profitable part of the business, more profitable than the equipment side.","Mig Dobre","All right. And then my follow up is back to Auto, looking at the core margin this quarter which was flattish on pretty good volume growth. I\u2019m wondering if there is a bit of a mix issue there or anything else you would highlight.","Scott Santi","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s really a product mix issue.","Mig Dobre","And how do we think about?","Scott Santi","So, I\u2019m just saying Mig, 25.5% in automotive pretty solid margins and you\u2019re right to point out that the volume leverage really here is the reason why I didn\u2019t show up is the product mix issue.","Mig Dobre","Is this with us going forward into the fourth quarter?","Scott Santi","No.","Michael Larsen","It might be it\u2019s hard to forecast to that level of detail. But what is going to be with us on a go-forward basis of these core margins, in the mid-20s.","Mig Dobre","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Just another question on the Auto margin, could you define what the purchase accounting charges were in Q3, and are there any one-offs in Q4?","Michael Larsen","Yes, no, I think rather than go through the individual pieces here Andy I\u2019d rather wait until we can give you the complete picture, also and include in that the guidance here for next year.","What I will tell you is that the business is actually performing a little bit better than what we thought from an operational standpoint. The operating margins are like where we thought they were going to be. There were no surprises from a purchase accounting standpoint. And like we said there was no EPS impact here in the quarter.","Scott Santi","In fact means that the charges basically ate up what the business earned in the last couple of quarters, yes.","Michael Larsen","That\u2019s exactly right. So that\u2019s the way to think about it. And we\u2019ve talked about this Andy. When we give you guidance for \u201817, we\u2019ll give a complete picture.","Andy Casey","Okay, thank you, Michael. And then the last one in Polymers & Fluids, within that, the 1% North America decline. Can you give any color on that, and update us on what\u2019s going on in the Auto after market?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I think automotive aftermarket was pretty stable here again, flat to slightly positive. The decline is really tied to the maintenance, industrial MRO side of that business so industrial lubricants and consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. That is still somewhat challenged, the industrial MRO side.","Andy Casey","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Scott Santi","Good morning.","Ann Duignan","Good morning, sorry about the delay. Can you talk a little bit about the fundamentals in European Construction, and by country or by region and then by application? And where are you seeing strength, are you seeing any slowdown in the U.K., etcetera? If you could just give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing there, that would be great.","Michael Larsen","I think Europe was pretty good this quarter up 2%, pretty steady and really nothing unusual as we went through the quarter or nothing really material to point out on a country level. So pretty steady state, we feel pretty good about the demand levels, obviously up 2% and feel good about it going into Q4.","Ann Duignan","Okay, so no big changes in the U.K. versus some of the other regions?","Scott Santi","Not at this point.","Michael Larsen","No, I mean, overall U.K. as you know, our U.K. business overall, I\u2019m not talking construction, it\u2019s about 4% of sales and was actually positive in the quarter, like we talked about before the impact right now what we\u2019re seeing is on the currency side moving on to translation side of things. But we haven\u2019t seen anything other than that that\u2019s worth mentioning.","Ann Duignan","And the FX, is that a net positive or a net negative? Are you exporting out of the U.K. or importing into the U.K.?","Scott Santi","We\u2019re producing and selling in the U.K.","Michael Larsen","Yes, the impact is really on the translation side. So we are, we have run profitable businesses in the U.K. and when we bring those, we translate those, pound, British Pound, earnings into U.S. dollars, there is a headwind. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate the color. And then just a little bit more color on the automotive sorry to keep coming back to automotive. But your comments that mix had an impact on the quarter. Can you just give us more color there, is that regional mix or mix of builds, and just a little bit more on how we should think about that going forward?","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean, when we were talking about this product mix, I think in North America and so, our content for vehicle might be slightly different by product line and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about.","Ann Duignan","So can I take that as there isn\u2019t a huge difference in margins regionally?","Michael Larsen","Yes, that\u2019s correct, yes.","Ann Duignan","Okay, that\u2019s important. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in line.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks, good morning. I think you made indirect reference to this, David Raso, but how is your visibility changing on winding down PLS activities? To what extent are you increasingly confident that 2016 is the last main year we\u2019ll see it as a headwind?","Scott Santi","Well, I think what I would prefer to do is like to go through this planning cycle that we just talked about we will give you a good update on that in December. But I think before we do any speculating let our businesses run their plans for \u201817 through and then we\u2019ll have a better picture there. Clearly at some point they will start lining down. I would also argue on the other side, we are - this is activity that is very healthy from the standpoint of profitability and focus.","So to the extent that there is continued activity there that we\u2019re going to continue to continue to support it until we get all the stuff out of here that we think needs to go so we can really focus on in the highly profitable parts of our business that we think have long-term growth potential.","So, we\u2019ll see what happens. I would expect it certainly things start to at least stabilize there if not start to slow down. But until we go through the actual details of what our businesses have in mind for next year, it\u2019s hard to comment.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then within your 35% or so incremental margin targets, how should we think about or how much of that is driven by pricing versus volume? As we look at slide 5, it looked like we had a negative volume impact there, so just trying to break that down if we could.","Michael Larsen","Yes, pricing is not a big margin driver for us here. Really the big margin driver is and has been I think Scott mentioned 12 quarters in a row of the enterprise initiatives, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the margin expansion. And the incremental margins, to go back and look historically that\u2019s where the company has been for a very long time in that 30% to 35% range.","And really on the pricing side, all we\u2019re trying to do is to offset some material cost inflation but it\u2019s not the key driver of our growth or of our margin expansion.","Steven Fisher","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I think you said price cost was like 10 basis points or something in the quarter. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything interesting to talk about on either the price or the cost side, and how we think that\u2019s going to look maybe in the fourth quarter? Does it actually turn negative, or whatever commentary you might have there? Thanks.","Michael Larsen","Yes, no there is really nothing interesting to report. I mean, like I think I said all we\u2019re trying to do is offset to the extent that there is material cost inflation that\u2019s we\u2019re trying to offset that with price. We\u2019ve been in this, 10 basis points to 20 basis points range for a number of quarters here, actually longer than that. And we expect to stay in that range on a go-forward basis.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay. I guess there\u2019s a perception that some of these material costs are starting to go up. Are you seeing that and you\u2019re just able to price for it, or is that not consistent with what you\u2019re seeing?","Michael Larsen","We\u2019re not seeing any material cost inflation at this point. And when we do we will react like I said, and do our best in the divisions to offset that with efficiency and with price.","Stephen Volkmann","I appreciate it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our last question for today we have Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I just guess just two follow-up questions. One, in your prepared remarks you mentioned free cash flow. The free cash flow was a little light, and it sounded like there were some timing issues. Can you just talk around that sort of what the issues were and how much incremental that is to the fourth quarter?","And then second, I guess when I looked at your Construction revenues on an organic basis, it\u2019s still up but obviously the increases are declining. So just a little color on your concern whether that market is turning at all in particular with the ABI data points that we\u2019re getting out because commercial was also very strong within the Construction segment? Thanks.","Michael Larsen","So, I think on the free cash flow, like I said on a year-to-date basis we\u2019re exactly what we were last year so there is, things can move around a little bit on a quarterly basis, for example, our CapEx number is up a little bit this quarter, but year-to-date it\u2019s exactly in line with last year.","And then maybe some larger payments that go out in one quarter versus another, we fully expect we\u2019ll be at above 100% for the year, which would imply a strong Q4, which seasonally that\u2019s what we usually do. So, other than that, we feel very good about the free cash flow performance.","And on the construction side, I would just add, similar to what we said earlier, I mean, demand is pretty steady state. There are some comp issues that we\u2019re dealing with but we feel good about the using current run rates to model the fourth quarter and we\u2019re not expecting any big changes from where we are right now.","Jamie Cook","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Okay. That\u2019s all for the questions sir.","Michael Larsen","Very good. Thank you very much.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's conference is being recorded. At the end of today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session","It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, the floor is yours.","Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Ian. Good morning and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2018 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss third quarter financial results and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.","Slide number 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2017 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","Turning to slide 3. Today, we're announcing the date and location for ITW's Investor Day. We hope you can join us on Friday, December 7 in New York City, at which time we'll provide updates on our long-term strategy as well as guidance for 2019. If you plan to attend, we ask that you please register on our Investor website.","Moving on to slide 4, as a reminder, in the third quarter of 2017, we disclosed an $80 million favorable legal settlement. This table summarizes key financial measures on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis that excludes the legal settlement. Going forward, in our presentation this morning, our comments and variances exclude the legal settlement.","I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The ITW team delivered a solid quarter with 11% earnings growth and EPS at the high end of our guidance range. We improved operating margin by 30 basis points to 24.6% and increased free cash flow by 17%.","In the quarter, pricing actions more than offset material cost inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis and price\/cost-related margin percentage dilution showed sequential improvement versus the second quarter.","In Q3, we delivered on our earnings commitment with top-tier margins and returns despite more challenging end-market conditions than we anticipated as we headed into the quarter in a few places. North America remained solid with 4% organic growth, while demand in international markets was mixed as auto production in Europe and China and demand levels in several international markets served by our Specialty Products and Polymers & Fluids segments softened.","Michael will walk you through the details in a few minutes, but at a high level, the pullback in auto production in Europe and China and the softening that we saw in the two segments I mentioned internationally negatively impacted the company's overall organic growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points in Q3 versus what it would have been had demand in those sectors stayed even the second quarter run rates.","In addition, and as expected, ongoing Product Line Simplification activities reduced organic growth by 70 basis points in the quarter. Our proprietary business model continues to generate strong free cash flow with 116% conversion in the quarter, supporting our ability to raise our dividend 28% to an annualized $4 a share and repurchased $500 million of our shares in the third quarter.","While we expect that near-term market challenges will continue in the fourth quarter, we're narrowing our guidance range and reaffirming the midpoint of our 2018 EPS guidance at $7.60 per share, which represents 15% growth.","Our ability to deliver consistent strong results across a wide range of economic and end-market scenarios is a direct reflection of the resilience of our high-quality diversified business portfolio, the strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's focused execution of ITW's long-term strategy.","Before I turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter, I'd like to again thank our more than 50,000 ITW colleagues around the world for their efforts in executing our strategy and serving our customers with excellence each and every day.","Michael, over to you?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. Let's recap some of the highlights on slide 5. Year-over-year earnings growth in the quarter was 11% or 13%, excluding $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation impact. Despite the more challenging end-market conditions in a few places that Scott talked about, we delivered earnings per share of $1.90, at the high end of our guidance range.","Organic revenue growth increased a solid 4% in North America, offset by a 1% decline in Europe and a 2% decline in Asia-Pacific. China was down 2% in the quarter, but we remain on track for mid-single-digit growth in 2018 after being up 13% last year. Operating margin was 24.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year and versus the second quarter. I will go into more detail on margin on the next slide.","After-tax return on invested capital was 28%, an improvement of 400 basis points, resulting primarily from the new U.S. tax rules and regulations. Effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% due to a net discrete tax benefit of $15 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was strong at $743 million, an increase of 17%, and in the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our shares and raised our annual dividend 28%.","Moving to slide 6 and our operating margin. Operating margin at 24.6% was a new record when you exclude the favorable legal settlement last year. Our strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives continue to contribute in a meaningful way with 100 basis points in the quarter.","Our price actions are catching up to raw material cost inflation as price\/cost margin dilution impact in the third quarter improved to 60 basis points from 70 basis points in the second quarter. And in addition, price more than offset raw material costs on a dollar-for-dollar basis this quarter.","The other line includes a numbers of puts and takes, year-over-year including some growth investment impact and is in line with our normal run rate this quarter as a 30 basis point impact to margin. All-in, operating margin expanded by 30 basis points in the quarter to 24.6%.","I'm going to spend some time on the left side of slide 7 to provide additional color on the organic growth performance relative to our expectations heading into the third quarter. It comes down to three key drivers, all of them related to international end-markets that collectively reduced our organic growth rate by 2 percentage points.","The first one is our international Automotive OEM business as both European and Chinese auto production came in lower than expected. European auto production declined 5% in the quarter, following 4% growth in the second quarter. Based on what we're hearing, this was due primarily to the new emission regulations that went into effect in the quarter and lower exports to China.","Overall, this change in builds led to a 6% decline in our auto business in Europe, following 3% growth in the second quarter. Auto production in China was down 4%, following 11% growth in the second quarter. This change appears to be more related to overall consumer sentiment and the availability of financing. As a result, our China business, which was up 12% in the first half, was flat.","We experienced some softness in a few international end markets served by our Polymers & Fluids segment. Specifically in Europe, additives for automotive aftermarket and reagents experienced lower demand, as did our Polymers & Fluids division in Brazil. Overall, the international component of our Polymers & Fluids segment declined 5% in Q3 in contrast with our North American business, which was up a solid 3%.","Finally, the international component of our Specialty Products segment was down 7% after being down 2% in Q2. There were significant PLS activities this quarter in addition to demand declines versus Q2 levels in three divisions; marking and coding, graphics primarily for sports apparel, and appliance components.","That said, as you can see from the left of the slide, there were some bright spots too internationally. Welding accelerated to 12% growth with a solid recovery in oil and gas, after 1% growth in Q2. Test & Measurement and Electronics and Food Equipment, both had sequential organic growth increases of 2 full percentage points.","Let's walk through each segment for additional color, starting with Automotive OEM on the right side of the slide. Overall, organic growth was flat with builds down about 3% for North America, Europe and China combined. North America was strong, up 7%, 5 percentage points ahead of builds with solid penetration gains. As I mentioned, Europe was down 6%, in line with builds, and China was flat versus builds down 4%.","We continue to generate solid penetration gains with European Auto OEM customers. However, inventory reductions to adjust for lower forecasted build rates offset these penetration gains, resulting in our revenues essentially declining in line with European auto rates in Q3. Despite some of the price challenges in the Automotive segment that we've discussed on prior calls, Automotive was able to hold margins on a year-over-year basis. And if it wasn't for higher restructuring expense related to acquisition integration, margins would actually have improved year-over-year.","Moving on to slide 8, Food Equipment was a bright spot, with organic revenue growth of 4% as overall demand continued to accelerate from the first half of the year. North America, overall, was up 4% with equipment up 6%, and up 10% excluding the retail sector, which remains challenging due to lower customer investments and a tough comp from a major international rollout in 2017. We saw particular strength on the institutional side, up in the mid-teens as health care was up 20%-plus and education and lodging were both up 10%-plus.","International was also solid, up 3% on equipment and up 4% on service. Operating margin of 26.6% was up more than 100 basis points sequentially from Q2 and down slightly year-over-year due to unfavorable product mix.","Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was up 3%. Test & Measurement was strong up 7% with Instron up double digits. Electronics slowed slightly due to lower demand in end markets related to solar and consumer electronics, while semiconductor remains fairly stable. Operating margin improved by 60 basis points to 24.7%, a new record for the segment.","On slide 9, Welding had another strong quarter with 10% organic growth and really strong performance across the board. Global equipment grew 12% and consumables were up 9%. By region, North America was up 10% and international growth was up 12%. The industrial business and oil and gas were both up double digit and the commercial business grew in the high-single digits. Margin expanded by 160 basis points to 28.2%.","As we discussed, Polymers & Fluids organic growth was down 1 point despite solid 3% growth in North America. New product launches in auto aftermarket contributed to organic growth and margin gains in North America. Operating margin improved by more than 100 basis points.","Turning to slide 10. Construction delivered 1% organic growth in the quarter, as Europe led the way with 4% organic growth. North America was essentially flat with residential down 1 point on a tough comparison and inventory destocking. Recall that residential was up 7% in the third quarter last year. Underlying demand in residential remains solid as the business is up 4% on a year-to-date basis and the outlook for Q4 looks in line with that growth rate.","Commercial was solid too, up 5% and operating margin improved 40 basis points. As we talked about in Specialty, organic growth slowed on the international side. But there were also some real bright spots with 5% growth in consumer packaging, up 6% year-to-date and 7% growth in packaging equipment. Overall, packaging equipment is up 12% year-to-date. On a year-to-date basis, the segment is about flat, which is also our outlook for the year as the comps are challenging in Q4.","Moving on to slide 11 with an update on raw material costs and tariffs. We continue to make good progress on price\/cost as our ongoing price actions are catching up to raw material cost inflation as pricing dollars are ahead of cost dollars in a meaningful way and the margin dilution impact is stabilizing.","We continue to view the tariff impact as manageable and are adjusting pricing as necessary to offset the approximately $30 million impact in 2018. As we talked about in the last call, our exposure is significantly mitigated by our produce where we sell strategy and the fact that only 2% of ITW's spend is sourced from China.","For 2019, we estimate the impact of tariffs at around $60 million, which is based on all announced tariffs and tariff increases as well as any carryover from 2018. And we continue to expect that our pricing actions will continue to offset raw material cost inflation, including tariff impact on a dollar-for-dollar basis.","Let's go to slide 12 and guidance, we remain on track to deliver our full year EPS guidance midpoint of $7.60 despite some of the challenges we've talked about today. Our midpoint represents 15% earnings growth year-over-year. And as you saw, we narrowed the EPS range to $7.55 to $7.65 per share.","In 2018, as we have for the last five-plus years, we will continue to expand our already best-in-class operating margins, returns on capital, and free cash flows. For the year, we expect revenue growth of 3% to 4% with organic growth of 2% to 3%, and operating margins in the 24% to 25% range.","Enterprise Initiatives contributed more than 100 basis points again this year. We are planning to repurchase approximately $2 billion of our own shares in 2018 and our tax rate for the year is expected to be in the 25% range. Our Q4 EPS guidance is $1.78 to $1.88, up 8% year-over-year, with organic growth in the 1% to 2% range based on current levels of demand.","Looking forward, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated results across a wide range of macroeconomic and end-market scenarios as we leverage and diversified high-quality business portfolio, the strength of ITW's proprietary business model, and our team's ability to execute.","We hope to see many of you at our Investor Day on December 7. At that time, we'll discuss the details of our finish the job agenda as we work to get the remainder of our divisions to their full potential in terms of organic growth and continue to improve on our best-in-class operating margins, returns on capital, and free cash flow over the next two years.","Karen, back to you.","Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Michael. Ian, let's go ahead and open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe just kind of starting out, just a clarification on the Auto OEM growth. So, saw organic growth was down 5% this quarter. When I do the regional builds, the plus 7% North America, minus 6% Europe, flat China, something just \u2013 I don't know, the math isn't really working out for me. A bit curious, like, are you guys disproportionately greater in Europe than you are in North America? I thought North America was a larger geography.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","So, I don't know what data you're looking at Joe, but we are overweight in North America, followed by Europe and then China.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah \u2013 and okay. Maybe I can follow-up offline. It's just that the minus 5% number versus the regional builds looks a little bit odd. I guess maybe just sticking with organic growth for a second. If you think about the fourth quarter, 1% to 2%, pretty similar to 3Q. But the comps get tougher on a 2-year basis, I guess just from an underlying perspective, what do you guys expect to be better in 4Q versus 3Q?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. Joe, so we just hit a $1.90 EPS. The midpoint for Q4 is $1.83. The revenue is expected to be fairly similar at current levels of demand. The mix is going to be a little bit better by segment. So, some of our higher margin businesses such as Food, Specialty Products should improve.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Construction.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","And Construction and even Polymers & Fluids, their growth rates should improve in Q4 relative to Q3, offset by Auto which is really at this point one of the lower-margin businesses inside the company. So, that's really on the revenue side, 1% to 2% organic. We expect to expand margins year-over-year, as we've done every quarter this year. Price\/cost turned positive on a dollar basis in Q3 versus neutral for the first half.","Currency headwind is a little bit lower in Q4 than in Q3. The share count's a little bit lower. The tax rate's a little difficult to call. There's some new guidance expected here in Q4. But overall, we've got a solid path here to our guidance. And I may be just point to our track record over the last five years.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just maybe specifically, just on organic growth for Auto OEM in the fourth quarter. Are you expecting that to improve at all in 4Q versus 3Q?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","If anything, we expect it to get a little bit worse than Q3.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Good enough. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Just taking your comments there on revenue Q4 versus Q3, and knowing the way that you guys guide, kind of at your current run rate. That would imply that 2019 revenue would come in around $14.4 billion, if I just took Q4 and multiplied it by 4, which you know...","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","You mean for 2018, Ann, or \u2013 you said 2019, you mean 2018?","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, I was going to start like in a 2019, because you'll guide for that in December. But my point being that that would be well below your long-term target of 3% to 5% organic growth. I mean, is that \u2013 am I missing something or is that the way we should be thinking about it that the fourth quarter run rate will be what you build off of for organic growth for next year? Or is there anything new or different?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Too early to say. We're going through our planning process right now. And so, we'll update you in December in terms of our view on a go-forward basis. But beyond the macro, we are working on, as we have been for the last five years, repositioning of our businesses really on two levels as we've talked about for a while now.","One is that we've got a lot of work to do in terms of operational excellence reapplying 80\/20. And once we get there, getting those businesses to leveraging their growth potential \u2013 realizing their organic growth potential, we're today at about 50% there in terms of the divisions that I would say have \u2013 are operating sort of within the range of their potential, both from the standpoint of 80\/20 and from the standpoint of their organic growth, where the combined organic growth year-to-date of those 51% of our divisions is about 7.5% year-to-date.","So, part of our growth over next year is certainly beyond the macro is the continued improvement in the underlying performance of those other 49% of our businesses. We're going through the planning process now. So, there's a number of different things beyond just the macro that are going to affect our organic growth rate. But I think we're pretty encouraged by the progress that we've generated in the 50% of the divisions that are largely there. And as I said, 7.5% year-to-date on a combined basis is pretty good and speaks a lot to the potential to continue to move down that path at the entire company level.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's useful color. I didn't realize there were so many still to be realized, just with the potential. And just a follow-up on, you noted that in Food Equipment margin was down on mix. Is that because it was more equipment and less service? Is that the right way to think about that? And then, what's the outlook there for the mix?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","It's really more related to what's going on, on the retail side of the business being down in a pretty significant way.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And the outlook there for retail continued weakness?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Certainly, in the near term, we don't expect any improvement on the retail side here...","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Through Q4.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","...through Q4. I think when you look at the balance of the year, the momentum going into Q4 in food specifically looks good. We'd expect a slight improvement in the growth rate in Q4 relative to Q3. And I'd just point, margins, you're right, the mix did have an impact on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, they were up over 100 basis points.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in queue. I appreciate the color.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz, Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Scott or Michael, can you give us a little more color into your margin performance in terms of the sustainability of that performance into 2019? Again, I know you'll talk about this more in December. But if I look at the quarter, enterprise strategy tailwind was still solid, and volume was a little less of a tailwind. But the other headwind was half of what it was last quarter. I know you didn't break out growth this time. Price versus cost is a little better. So as you look in 2019, do you have decent visibility at this point that your enterprise strategy could still be a 50 basis point to 100 basis point tailwind? You already talked about price versus cost and that other doesn't creep back up, so you still see good margin expansion next year.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Andy, it's a little early here. We haven't gone through the plans for 2019 yet. Just on other specifically, this is kind of our normal run rate, if go back and look where \u2013 it's in that 20 basis points to 30 basis points range, may move around a little bit, but I think that's a pretty safe assumption on a go-forward basis.","At Investor Day, we'll lay out specifically the finish the job agenda. And what we're trying to accomplish for the next two years, including continued margin expansion, and as we've said in the past, we certainly expect a positive impact from the Enterprise Initiatives next year. But I can't give you the number as we sit here, simply because we haven't gone through the plans and we haven't looked at the projects and activities and the carryover that will get us to a solid number for 2019.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","But we'll lay it out in December.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Right.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, Michael, that's helpful. And just the comment that you just made about 50% of the businesses still have potential for pivot to growth. I guess my understanding was that 2018, for you kind of was a pivotal year for you guys in terms of this pivotal \u2013 pivot to growth. And when we think about what growth is going to come in at for this year, it's probably going to be less than 2017. And again, I know that some of the markets have turned down. But when you look at businesses like Construction or Specialty Products, Polymers & Fluids, how much of the \u2013 in growth weakness is maybe that these businesses aren't performing yet to the potential that they can versus just simple market weakness?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, it's certainly some of both. I think what I can tell you is that inside the company, this is not a sector issue in terms of Polymers & Fluids versus Automotive, or any of our other segments. This is 87 divisions that operate inside in each of those seven segments and we're at about the 51%, as I said earlier, in terms of businesses that are both operating at the level of excellence that they're capable of from an operational standpoint, application of 80\/20, and are driving organic growth at a range that is within what we believe their potential is. And the other 50%, we've got more work to do. And those are pretty equally spread across all seven segments, so there's no particular tilt.","I certainly expect that we would have put some better overall progress on the board have we not had auto pullback, like it's pulling back in the second half of the year. It's been our fastest-growing segment. So, we're giving up a little bit in the near term. But our focus is on getting this company to its full potential. We think we've got about two years left to run in terms of getting all the way there. I don't want to steal the story from December, but that's what Michael's alluding to and we've got plenty of more room to go on both from an operational margin standpoint, and certainly, we've got to get the other 49% of our divisions moving faster on organic. And it's not that they have under-executed, it's that they've started from further back, they've had more work to do to get there. And I think \u2013 our plan at this point is to tell you that in some pretty specific detail at the December Investor Day. So, you'll have a good view of what we think (30:33) and what the processes will look like over the next couple of years to do it.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Scott, real simply, do you think that 2019, you could actually have more outperformance versus market than 2018? Is that sort of the plan as we sit here today?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I think, give us a chance to run through all the operating plans. We're right in the middle of that process now. I don't mean to be evasive at all. But I think the December Investor Day is in December for a reason, because it gives us a chance to go through in detail. But what I would say is, we will have a plan for, of the 49% of our divisions that are not there yet, how many of them are we going to get there in 2019 and what kind of help that's going to provide.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just curious, how are you going to think about the IHS forecast into next year's initial \u2013 into initial 2019 guide for auto? I mean, they continue to forecast 2% global production growth in 2019, I believe. I mean with China up 4%, the U.S. kind of flattish, Europe up a little bit. So, I mean, you can't help but wonder, obviously, if there's downward bias based on all the profit warnings we're seeing in the global auto space. So, are you going to abandon pegging your outlook to IHS and take a more conservative approach or how are you going to think about that?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, I think certainly over the last couple of quarters, the facts are that the backward look IHS in terms of what production actually was is pretty good. The forward looks have not been so good. So, obviously, we're going to think \u2013 we'll probably take a more ITW-specific view based on own experience as we think about 2019 for auto.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then in Test & Measurement, I think last quarter you had attributed some of the slowdown in organic to delivery timing. But the organic seem to slow down even further. Was there an underlying slowdown that was stronger than expected in any of your business? And there certainly seems to be a lot of negative headlines on semis. You said your semi-related business was stable. So, could you still have a softening there still ahead of you or are you just positioned in a part of the market that's going to be immune from some of these broader pressures?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No, I think semi, as we said, was fairly stable here in Q3, which means positive growth, although at a lower rate than what we've seen in the first half of the year. That was as expected. We do expect it to slow a little bit further here in Q4 and that's included in our guidance.","The other thing to keep in mind for Test & Measurement is you're running up against a difficult comp here in Q4. On a year-over-year basis, that segment was up 9% last year. And even though Test & Measurement was up 7% with a lot of strength in Instron here in Q3, the growth rate year-over-year is probably going to slow a little bit, just based on the comp. But the underlying demand trends in Test & Measurement and Electronics broadly are very solid.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And just the last one on Polymers & Fluids. I mean some of the global peers in that market seem to be getting squeezed pretty hard by raw material cost, but your margins actually surprise to the upside. I mean, is there a cost pressure still on the comm in that segment? Or do you think you've just adjusted prices faster than anybody else?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I can't really comment on everybody else. I can tell you what we're doing. We are seeing a fair amount of cost pressure, other than auto, it's the second highest in terms of price\/cost impact. But they've done a great job really reacting on the pricing side and more than offsetting those cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","And as we said before, we don't hedge so we have been incurring those costs as they are happening.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's a good point. I mean relative to others, and this is true, and maybe to expand a little bit is, not just on raw materials, but also on currency, because we do not hedge currency and raw material costs, maybe they show up faster at ITW and gives our businesses a real-time view of what's going on and then they can react maybe faster on the pricing side. So...","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch, Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Going back, Michael, to the semi exposure, can you just remind us how much of Test, Measurement, Electronics is semi? And I think to that last question, is there something about the nature of your exposure that's allowed you to outperform?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","It's about $200 million. I can't really comment specifically on why we're outperforming. Like I said, we've certainly benefited from strong growth over a long period of times. The growth rate slowed a little bit here in Q3, as expected. And we expect it to slow a little bit further here in Q4. How that compares to everybody else, I'm not sure I can give you a good view.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","No, no. That's fine. So, auto's \u2013 globally, you guys continue to outperform in North America and China. Last couple of quarters you've had slightly below build average results in Europe. And I'm wondering is that tied to the WLTP emission stuff with respect to your portfolio, are you positioned \u2013 like, are you doing to some PLS work there, which is what may be or may not be going on in Europe?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think, John, it's more related to the fact that sort of inventory levels are getting adjusted to these lower build rates. We have a lot of confidence based on new programs that we've added and are continuing to add that we are still getting penetration gains in Europe, and it's just a matter of those are being offset by our customers pulling inventory down. Their requirements are less because they're producing less. But you'll see it go back to positive, certainly, over the next couple of quarters depending on how \u2013 where the overall production rates go.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Yes. No, that makes sense. Maybe one more. So, thinking about Polymers & Fluids and then Specialty, other aspects of your portfolio over the last few years have grown more rapidly than these businesses, pretty strong performance, relatively strong competitive positionings.","And then as Europe's obviously softened, you've got elements of these portfolios on, I think, the consumable side weakening. So, I'm curious, Scott, does this \u2013 it's one of those things where they \u2013 I'm sure they're all good businesses, but they're not necessarily performing as resiliently as some of your other segments. Does this suggest that maybe there's a lot more PLS work to do or, perhaps, even may be make some select divestitures on, I don't know, some of these consumable elements of both of those segments.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, I think what I can say for sure is, in both cases, for slightly different reasons, they are \u2013 the starting point, it was certainly further back in the pack in terms of just the kind of complexity. Polymers & Fluids was a complete acquisition built segment. So, we just had a lot more \u2013 we've had a lot more stuff to deal with there in terms of getting them positioned to do what we've been capable of.","That's sort of where I sit today, I think we've got another couple of years to get this whole company where we think it can be. And in those two, I'd say, parts of Specialty and a lot of Polymers & Fluids, it's just a matter of the starting point was further back, if you will, in terms of making the kind of transformation that we're in the process of making.","Both are highly differentiated. Look at the margin rates, they're really solid, positions inside some really strong niches. So, I think we like the competitive position, overall, but they have to grow faster, there's no doubt.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Well, maybe...","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","And if we determine that they can't at some point, then I think your logic is not unreasonable. But I think we've got some more room to go before we are ready to make a call on that.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Maybe just one last one on that point. Is there any kind \u2013 I realize there's a lot of niche business in here. Is any of this pertaining to scale? So, in other words, maybe instead of looking at divestitures, maybe it might make sense to add to those portfolios in some manner to beef-up scale to kind of push it further over the goal line, if you will? Again, it's...","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think, all of that, across the whole portfolio, is stuff \u2013 those are sort of options that are certainly both valid and really interesting. I think, just given the level of performance, the profitability, and what we think the core growth potential is, I think, what \u2013 our focus is \u2013 let's get what we have in full potential position and not try to fix our problems. Let's address it with the businesses by operating the business we own to their full potential. And from that view then, we can look at how we might supplement or perhaps organize ourselves differently.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Yeah. Makes perfect sense. Thanks very much.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann, Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications, if I might. I guess, we had a little bit of sequential improvement in sort of the price\/cost headwind on margins. And I assume your goal is still to sort of fully offset that over time. Is the 10 basis point sequential improvement the right way to think about kind of the path to get there or can you do it more quickly?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I think what's encouraging is that the margin impact, specifically year-over-year, seems to have stabilized. And certainly, it's encouraging to see an improvement in Q3 relative to Q2. This is not going to be a quick fix. I mean, we do expect, between raw materials and tariffs, we're going to have to continue to work the price lever, which we are. And the other piece of the equation is, we were favorable, price dollars were significantly higher than the cost dollars here in Q3, relative to the first half where were neutral. So, that's \u2013 when we talk about things beginning to improve, that's really what we're talking about. But obviously, we're in a pretty dynamic environment here in terms of raw material costs and tariffs. And I just want to be a little bit cautious in terms of saying that all of this is all behind us. We're going have to continue to work this really hard, but certainly encouraged by what we've seen here in the near term.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks, Michael. And then, just a quick follow-up, and I apologize to keep beating on Auto. But I think you had mentioned in your comments that there was a fair amount of restructuring and integration expense. And I think you said margins would have been up without that. And I'm just curious sort of where are we in that process. How long does that continue? As we get further down the road, when does that headwind sort of fade, if it does?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. We're making really good progress there. We're in the year three of basically a five-year process, and we're talking specifically about EF&C that we added.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","And so, the things are certainly progressing, I would say, at this point, ahead of plan. It's a great business. We've added some great team members and progress is really good. And I think some of the quarterly timing in terms of restructuring is also \u2013 I don't think it's a particularly big headwind for margin in auto on an annual basis. It does jump out in the quarter based on timing of when we're actually implementing certain things. And I think that was probably more of the case.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. I think that the impact in Q3 here was 40 basis points. We laid out a plan, Steve \u2013 5-year plan to get margins to 20% and really a steady 200 basis points improvement every year. And that's what we've delivered so far. But it's not a one-time, it's really more of an ongoing program. No rush to do this, but we're definitely on the right track here.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. And then, just one final knit, if I could. The destocking that you're seeing in European auto, I guess, we had sort of heard through the channel that that was somewhat short term in nature. And I guess, you're sort of saying that's going to continue. But at some point, I suppose that that headwind goes away as well.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Well, we think \u2013 from what we're hearing, the biggest factor is new emission standard, and there has been a lot of, let's call them, bottlenecks in terms of our customers getting their vehicles through that process. And to the extent, I \u2013 it's not something that we control, nor is it something that we have either direct input from our customers on or a point of view in terms of where that bottleneck clears and things, let's say, normalize.","But that was a big factor in Europe in terms of the reduction \u2013 the decline in production in Q3. That's certainly going to continue to be there in Q4. We will hope to have a look into 2019 by December in terms of \u2013 at least, give you our view of how that will play out. And the other part of Europe was also the softer demand in China. The fair amount of auto production in Europe is exported to China and, ultimately, have demand there. There being China on a go-forward basis will also have an impact. But right now, we're calling this Q4 and we're not expecting any change.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey, Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm trying to understand some of the patterns that seem to be appearing in the results on that, it seems a little sporadic by region, but industrial seems like it's reasonably strong, but some of the consumer-oriented stuff seems to be softening. Is that consistent with how you're looking at the portfolio? And if so, outside of international auto, can you talk about whether you're seeing any of your channel partners destock?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","We talked a little bit about destocking on the Construction side, really into the big-box retailers here in Q3. That's really more of a near-term impact. You're correct, I mean, the industrial side continues to be very solid. And then, on the consumer side, we are seeing some slightly lower growth rates on a year-over-year basis. I think on a geographic basis, like we talked about, I mean, North America continues to be really solid, up in the mid-single digits year-to-date and for the year. And really, what changed here in Q3 versus Q2 is what we talked about in terms of the international side of the business. Now when you look at it by geography, it's hard to say that there are any real trends.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","It's pretty narrow in terms of the impact that we saw in auto and a couple of spots and pockets.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","It's a couple of pockets of \u2013 offset by strength in other pockets. So, we're not making any regional calls here in terms of what's going on from a macro standpoint. We saw some challenges in a few end markets, but there was also strength in other markets in that same region. So, we're not making a region call here.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, separately, on Food Equipment, within your prepared remarks, you mentioned retail was weak. Can you give a little bit more color on that?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'd rather not go into too much detail here. I'm sorry, Andy. I mean, what I can tell you is it's been pretty challenged for a year now. The comps are going to get easier, but really last year we saw the beginning of a slowdown in investment...","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","This is grocery stores.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","...in grocery stores, as it relates to our products around \u2013 these are scales, weigh\/wrap equipment. We also had a major new roll out of product last year that didn't repeat this year. And we'll see when we do the plans here in a couple of weeks with the Food Equipment team what to expect for next year. But for Q4, in the near term here, we're expecting that things do not get better on the retail side. And it's really a strength outside of retail what we call foodservice on the equipment side, particularly on the institutional side, where our business is up in the mid-teens with a lot of strength, as we talked about, on the healthcare, education, lodging, those trends certainly look really good.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And if I could squeeze a clarification, and that 2019 $60 million headwind from tariff impact, does that include the anticipated 25% List 3 increase next year?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yes, it does.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Melius Research.

Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. It's working. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. One, John sort of asked you about portfolio optimization, either divestures or acquisitions, whether you need scale or \u2013 to help the organic growth story. But how much is the macro sort of impacting your view of being more opportunistic on the M&A front, if multiples come down at all?","And then, my second question, just clarification. I think you said in response to one of the questions, in the fourth quarter, sequentially, you expect Polymers and \u2013 P&F and the Specialty division to improve sequentially, just was there anything specific driving that? Thank you.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I'll take the first one and I'll let Michael take the second one. And I, again, don't mean to be evasive, but I think in December we'll give you a fulsome update on our thinking with regard to portfolio and how we're thinking about it and how we will go forward.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yes. And specifically on the Polymers & Fluids and Specialty, our guidance is based on the current level of demand, current run rates in those businesses. We've factored in the comps on a year-over-year basis. And based on that, the year-over-year organic growth rate in Q4 is expected to be better than the equivalent in Q3. So, there's nothing specific other than based on current run rates, factoring in the comps.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then just follow-up question. Some other companies or investors have been concerned that with trade war talk, et cetera, and price increases that there has been any sort of pull forward in the demand, which is why some companies might be seeing good strength in the beginning of the year, and then things sort of deteriorating in the back half. I mean, do you get a sense for any of that as you can you talk to your customer base?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No. We're a book and bill. I mean, you order it today, we ship it tomorrow. We've not seen any pull forward that I can think of. I'm sort of running my head through the portfolio here. In fact, we've sort of given our delivery performance incentive by the opposite.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss, Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. How is it going?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wonder, is there any \u2013 you guys have been at this a long time. Are there any signals from your earlier cycle businesses that give you any sort of insight into what could be happening in the later cycle businesses further down the road?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","I can't really \u2013 we're looking at each other here and shaking our heads. We can't really think of anything, Joel, in terms of short cycle being leading indicator. Like we said, this was \u2013 other than auto and a few end markets internationally in the two segments we talked about, the performance is pretty good. And we're certainly not seeing anything that underlying demand trends are beginning to slow here.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Good. And then can we just spend a minute going through the different pieces inside the Construction business? We haven't talked about that very much. You mentioned big-box retail was destocking a little bit, but can you just talk about some of the other trends you're seeing there, please?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yes. I think that was really the big one that we called out. I mean I think, overall, 1% organic growth in the quarter. Europe really good, up 4%. Australia may be slowing just a little bit. In North America, the residential side was down and that's really more of a comp issue. We had \u2013 there's the hurricane impact in Q3.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","It was a factor this year versus last.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah. So hurricane impact last year, business was up 7%. Sequentially, on a run-rate basis, the underlying demand is still very good. The business is up 4% on a year-to-date basis. Q4 looks to be in line with that and the full year should be up in that 4% to mid-single digit range on the residential side.","Commercial is a smaller part of our business. It can be a little lumpy. It's been flattish for a while here. We're up 5% in the quarter. I wouldn't get too excited about that, to be honest with you. I mean I think this is a more of a low-single digit type growth rate on the commercial side. And even with this slowdown, some pressure on the cost side, the fact that the business improved operating margin 40 basis points is pretty good.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Great. Thank you.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Steven Fisher, UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Talking about international Welding, some nice strength there. Can you just talk about where that strength internationally is coming from, which markets and what visibility you have to kind of continuation of that?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, I think really what we saw was a pickup. So, most of our international businesses, as you remember, is oil and gas related. So, we saw a pretty nice recovery. Europe up 10%, a little bit more than that, 11% in the quarter, on the Welding side. China up 15%. So, the majority of that is really driven by oil and gas, which overall was up double digits. You saw the pickup also in consumables, I think up 12% in the quarter here. So, those are kind of the big \u2013 and just in terms of the sustainability, we haven't seen anything to suggest that things are slowing.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then, in terms of organic growth fourth quarter, kind of number of positive segments versus the number of negative. Obviously, we had a few, three that turned to the negative side in Q3. And as you've talked about, some of the comps get tougher in Q4. Anyway that \u2013 and we can also get to that 1% to 2% organic growth for the fourth quarter in a variety of different ways, though, I'm just curious if you think the number of segments that are going to be negative in the fourth quarter are going to be more than what we've seen here in the third quarter?","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","No.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","We expect it to be less, and it's really just \u2013 the one that stands out is Auto, even though Auto was about flat this \u2013 here in Q3. In our guidance and based on what we're seeing, we're planning for a little bit worse in that segment. The other segments should be positive. And for the full year, even Auto is going to be very close to positive in all segments, even including Auto.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If I could just ask a little bit of a more detailed question around price\/cost. So, just compared to the headwind that you guys have had over the past several quarters, what's the expectation that's baked into the fourth quarter guidance?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","So, we're assuming pretty similar Q4 to what we saw in Q3. It's like we said earlier, I mean, on the cost side, this is a pretty dynamic environment. Even though certain of the raws may, looking back, have stabilized, there are others where that's not the case. And so, it's hard to call, but we're expecting that Q4 is similar to Q3. And I think that's, hopefully, a pretty conservative assumption, but it's hard to tell.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then, on Specialty Products, that was kind of a big negative surprise for us this quarter. If you could just give us some color on what drove the pretty big swing to the organic decline and if that continues into the fourth quarter?","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, it was really the three divisions internationally that we talked about, so the marking and coding business, the graphics business, and then the appliance business, which \u2013 so we sell components into appliance customers. And then, a fair bit of PLS as well, particularly on the international side. So, those were the key drivers. I think what's \u2013 it masks a little bit of this really solid performance on the consumer packaging side, which \u2013 up 5%, the equipment side up 7%.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Which is the biggest in the segment.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Right.

Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Good morning.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just to follow-up quickly on the last question on price\/cost and how that layers in from here? I get that 4Q maybe doesn't look a lot different, but tariffs ramp up again to start the year. Is there a potential for that 60 basis points to actually get a little worse before it gets better? I'm not trying to put too finer point on or getting to 2019 guidance. It's just kind of an earmark date on the calendar that I want to understand a little bit better.","Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, Josh, the best I can give you is \u2013 we gave you what we think the impact of tariffs is going to be for 2019 at that $60 million compared to $30 million this year. That's a meaningful number, but nothing insurmountable here, certainly manageable as we continue to work the price side of things. But beyond that, I can't really tell you until we've gone through the detailed plans here with everybody. Just to be clear, the $60 million includes, I think we said this earlier, List 3 increase from 10% to 25%. And so, that's an all-in number, based on what we know today, but it's a pretty dynamic environment.","Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.","And everybody's going through it. So, the only thing I would add is that the pricing reaction of this in the marketplace has been going on all year, will continue to go on, not just by ITW, but you're hearing it from, I'm sure, all of other industrial companies that you cover. And so, I think the environment is one that, I think, we've got a good view as to how costs are going to continue to escalate in terms of what's known. We've got to continue to see and we're certainly not anticipating them to go the other way anytime soon. So I think from the standpoint of attention and focus and our ability to continue to respond as necessary and as appropriate, I think we're pretty comfortable with where we sit.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co.

Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results, update you on our 2016 earnings forecast and discuss the acquisition that we announced on Monday.","Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2016 first quarter and full-year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2014 Form 10-K and third quarter 2015 Form 10-Q for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

In 2015, ITW grew earnings per share 10%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4% and improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record 20.4%. Free cash flow was strong in 2015 at a 106% of net income, and we invested roughly $560 million in our businesses for growth and productivity.","In addition, we returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","In 2015, we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our Enterprise Strategy as evidenced by more than 100 basis points of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives. As a reminder, we expect an additional incremental 100 basis points of margin expansion from our Business Structure Simplification, Sourcing, and 80\/20 Excellence initiatives in each of 2016 and 2017.","In 2015, we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda, and we made meaningful progress with 60% of the company's revenues achieving ready-to-grow status and 45% growing at 6% in 2015. We continue to execute the various elements of our Enterprise Strategy in a well-planned and logical sequence as we position ITW to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of 2017 enterprise performance goals.","I'd like to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy.","I'll now turn the call over to Michael, and then, I'll be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody.","As you saw this morning, ITW delivered another strong quarter. EPS of $1.23 increased 4% versus prior year, 11% excluding currency. Our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved 110 basis points to 20.7% and our self-help enterprise initiatives contributed 110 basis points of improvement.","Organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance with some credit challenging comparisons in a few segments. While demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, underlying demand trends were stable across our business portfolio. Adjusted for seasonality, demand in our industrial businesses improved 4% sequentially in Q4 versus Q3. Free cash flow was very strong at 140% of net income, and, as you can see, we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics. In summary, stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong Q4 performance.","Turning to revenue by geography on page five, let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes a one percentage point impact from Product Line Simplification as organic revenue declined 0.6% with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year. By geography, North America was down 1.6% with our consumer facing businesses up 2% and the industrial businesses down 5.6%. International was positive, up 0.6% with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 1.9%.","Our consumer businesses grew 4.6% with strength in Automotive OEM up 10% in Europe and Food Equipment. Asia Pacific and China were essentially flat, and it's worth pointing out that China automotive was up 14% in the fourth quarter. So overall, stable end-market conditions across the portfolio and slightly better-than-expected organic revenue performance in the quarter against a fairly challenging comparison.","On page six, strong operating margin performance once again in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.7%, improved 110 basis points, and four segments improved between 220 basis points and 420 basis points, driven primarily by our self-help enterprise initiatives and lower restructuring. Pricing was solid in the quarter. Price\/cost was favorable, 30 basis points. So strong progress on operating margin, and as Scott said, we're on track to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward.","On page seven, we listed full-year 2015 operating margin by segment, and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the Enterprise Strategy.","Turning to the segments, starting with Automotive OEM, another strong quarter. Organic revenue up 5% and up 6% for the year, outpacing worldwide builds of 1%. Europe was up 10% organically in the quarter and up 11% for the year. North America was up 4% and China was up 14% in the quarter and up 8% for the year. Consistent with global industry growth rates, our 2016 guidance assumes a 1% increase in global auto builds versus 2015.","Solid quarter in Test & Measurement\/Electronics as margin improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 18.1%. Demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter. Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, revenues were up 6%, up 2% adjusted for typical seasonality. Also another solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 2% organically, facing some challenging comparisons from last year. You may recall that Equipment was up 6% worldwide in Q4 last year.","Operating margin improved 220 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 23.9%. North America service was up 4% and underlying equipment demand remained solid, particularly in bakery, healthcare and lodging. International equipment was up 4% on continued strong demand in warewash, cooking, and refrigeration.","Polymers & Fluids was down 3% due to soft demand related to industrial MRO, with North America down 4%, partially offset by Asia Pacific up 9%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 18.2%.","Welding was down 11% organically in a tough environment and against some challenging comparisons. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year North America was up 10% and oil and gas was up 20%. The 11% year-over-year decline breaks down as 6 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 2 points from commercial. North America overall was down 8%, with consumables essentially flat. International, as you can see, was down 20% due to oil and gas, primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore.","But as we've talked about on the last earnings calls, the year-over-year numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of 2015. On a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, we saw a significant step-down in demand in Q1 last year followed by slight declines in Q2 and Q3, and then, in this fourth quarter, demand actually improved 2% sequentially from Q3. Consistent with current demand levels, our 2016 guidance assumes a single-digit decline in the Welding segment.","On slide 10, Construction Products had another strong quarter on the top line and bottom line. Organic revenue was up 3% and margin was up 420 basis points. North America was up 2% with high-single-digit growth in the renovation and remodel channel. Residential was essentially flat, and commercial was down slightly. Asia Pacific was strong, up 7% due to Australia.","In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat, with solid growth in consumer packaging, offset by the impact of Product Line Simplification. Operating margin improved by 400 basis points, 23%.","Turning to slide 11, as you know, one of the core strengths of ITW is our diversified portfolio, and in the current environment, the fact that about 60% of our revenues are consumer facing. As you can see, in a tough environment, our consumer businesses, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, portions of Specialty Products and Construction, are growing at an organic rate of 3% in the fourth quarter and for the full-year, and the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable.","Our industrial businesses, Welding, Test & Measurement and Electronics, were down 6% in the quarter, and down 5% for the year. However, if you look at the seasonally adjusted sequential trend from Q3 to Q4 revenues are up 4%. In simple terms, based on typical seasonality, you would expect these businesses to be down 2% sequentially, but they were actually up 2%. It may be too early to call this a trend, but certainly, an encouraging data point as we look ahead.","Quickly on 2015, you can see that we continue to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics. EPS growth, operating margin improvement, return on capital, and free cash flow all reflect the strength of ITW's differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment.","Going back a little bit further to the launch of the Enterprise Strategy on slide 13, the same holds true. More than 500 basis points improvement in margin and returns, 17% EPS CAGR, and solid progress in our pivot to growth. As Scott said, 60% of the company's revenues achieved ready-to-grow status, and 45% grew at 6% in 2015. We fully expect that 85% of the company's revenues will be in ready-to-grow status by the end of 2016. In summary, over the last three years, really good progress, and we've done everything we said we would do. And we're on track to achieve our 2017 performance goals.","On slide 14, we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in New York on December 4. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is in line with Q4 demand levels, and includes 90 basis points of Product Line Simplification impact (12:55). In 2016, we expect 100 basis points or more of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives, independent of volume, and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately 22.5%, earnings per share in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, and 6% growth at the midpoint, and 10% growth excluding currency.","Turning to the first quarter, our EPS guidance is $1.20 to $1.30, and the midpoint of $1.25 represents 23% of our full-year earnings right in line with historical patterns. Again, we expect 100 basis points from our self-help enterprise initiatives, and based on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 2%.","Finally, a quick update on capital allocation, given the two recent developments, and then, I'll hand it over to Scott. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW for $450 million. From a capital allocation standpoint, approximately, 70% of the purchase price will be funded with non-U.S. cash. And we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the 16% to 20% range by year seven.","In addition, we see significant potential to improve the performance of the EF&C business through the application of ITW's 80\/20 business management system, and we expect margins to improve from approximately 10% to 20% by year five. The acquisition is slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, and based on the expected closing date, we expect very little EPS impact in 2016, with accelerating benefits into 2017 and beyond. Finally, we're maintaining our end of 2017 performance goals.","Second, based on our ability to tax-efficiently accessed $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash this month, we're increasing our share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. The associated EPS benefit for 2016 is largely offset by recent currency moves, but this additional $1 billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in 2017 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it Scott.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Michael and just now a couple of words on the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are holding on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM segment. As many of you know, we have a very focused niche strategy in this space. We are essentially a high velocity serial problem solver for OEM and tier suppliers.","The segment, in 2015, had $2.5 billion of revenue and an 8% organic growth CAGR since 2012. As we have talked on a number of occasions, we see very attractive long-term growth opportunities in this space within ITW's very focused niche positioning, and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last four years or five years as we've talked about on a number of occasions. And we've outgrown global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012.","So the addition of the ZF \u2013 the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy, broadens our market positions on slide 18. A very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus, this business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components largely focused on the interior of the car.","Business is headquartered in Germany, 13 manufacturing facilities and 3,500 employees globally. Very strong solid business, excellent customer relationships, very capable operating team, and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history.","On slide 18 (sic) [19], in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position, a couple of key points in that regard. First of all, it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics through the core product platforms that we support today, certainly have very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation. The business is bringing with it over 500 active patents.","And from the standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint, very tilted towards Asia, so it supplements our position in Asia. The overall business is, standpoint of revenue by geography, is 45% Europe, 20% North America, 35% in Asia Pacific, so very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall.","And certainly, the last point is we see significant potential to leverage our 80\/20 business management process in terms of helping the EF&C business continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margins on the way in (18:52) are about 10%, and as Michael talked about, we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first five years of ownership.","From the standpoint of the transaction components, purchase price is roughly one times sales. Michael talked about the near-term accretion, certainly, modestly positive in the first 12 months, including all non-cash acquisition accounting related costs, certainly, expect to generate returns on capital well within our target, over the first seven years to 10 years of the acquisition. Michael talked about our ability to fund 70% or so of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash, which is an acquisition from a strategic and operational and return standpoint that we would have done regardless of funding sources, but certainly, the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost, the ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here, but didn't drive the deal. And we expect to close in the second half of \u2013 or this first half of 2016.","So with that, I think we're \u2013 that's all for our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Are we going to proceed with the question-and-answer session?","Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, let's begin the question and answer, thank you.","Operator","You're welcome. One moment. Our first question will be coming from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And nice quarter. Maybe starting on the 2016 guide, you maintain the guide, and it seems like you've built some margin of error in the guide also with this $1 billion repatriation. And so, maybe talk a little bit about your opportunity to still hit at least the midpoint, maybe even the higher end of the guide, if in fact organic growth were to disappoint as we kind of progress through the year.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Joe, I'd say on the organic, 1% to 3% guide for 2016 is based on the demand levels we're seeing in the businesses today, as per usual. So we're not counting on improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions. Based on current run rates, we are solidly in that range of 1% to 3%.","I think in terms of margin of error, what I would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control, in terms of our self-help. And number one on the list are the enterprise initiatives that we've continued to execute well on over the last two years. And we expect another 100 basis points of margin expansion, independent of volume from those in 2016. If you translate that into EPS, as we said in December, that's about $0.30 of EPS growth.","Certainly, in addition to that, the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional EPS benefit. Unfortunately, some of that is, depending on the timing, is offset by recent currency moves. Not so much in the euro, but primarily in Canadian and Australian dollars, the pound, but it does give us a little bit of room here.","So overall, in terms of the guidance, we feel very good about maintaining where we're at in the $5.35 to $5.55 range, and we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth. You saw some of that in the fourth quarter. And just based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, we'd expect that to continue in 2016.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful color, Michael. Maybe as my follow-on question, there's a lot of concern in the market regarding what's happening in the auto end market. Clearly, that's an end market that has been incredibly good for you guys. You continue to outpace global auto builds, but it looks like this past quarter, we saw a little bit less outgrowth in Auto OEM. So maybe some color on your ability to continue to sustain outgrowth in that end market and how you think about that end market over the next 12 months.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, sure, Joe, this is Scott. I think the story for us remains one of penetration. Michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario, essentially, is for 1% increase in global auto builds next year. I think most of the sort of external forecasters and pundits are in the 2.5% to 3% range.","So in our own planning assumptions, I think we're taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline. It is also, as we talked about before, the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility vis-\u00e0-vis. We've sold programs into production plans going on this year. Those programs were sold two years and three years ago.","So I think we've got a pretty stable outlook on, in terms of what our expectations are for 2016, with respect to auto built into our plans. It doesn't mean that builds, if we see some inflection in \u2013 or some change in overall builds relative to our 1%, that's not going to have an impact, but ultimately, I think the potential impacts are pretty modest. I think we've got our plan set where there's an appropriate level of conservatism, and have enough new penetration and new content in 2016 coming online that we ought to be able to be all right regardless of \u2013 pending any sort of major crash, which I don't think anybody thinks is going to happen. I think we're in pretty good position in 2016.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks, Scott. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Scott, so can you talk a little bit more about the pivot to growth? How much more challenging do you think it could be to get your businesses that are preparing to grow, to get ready to grow, by the end of 2016, as you talked about in the Analyst Day, if the global economy is a bit weaker?","And maybe you can talk about what these businesses are. If I look at it, it seems like it'd be businesses like European construction, parts of polymers and fluids, parts of specialty products. But that's what I think. What do you think?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think you've hit \u2013 in terms of those three areas of the company, I think you've hit three that are still in the preparing to grow mode. The agenda is pretty much within our own control from the standpoint of what we have characterized as moving from preparing to grow to ready to grow. It's largely a lot of 80\/20 work, a lot of product line pruning, a lot of customer focus, and a lot of \u2013 as we talked in December, a lot on really lasering in on where are the best opportunities to grow.","So I don't think there's much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment. That agenda is pretty well mapped out. The timing is, in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company, from that prepared to grow to ready to grow, just a function of how big the agenda was to get from A to B. And in some cases, we had further to go than others. So the 60% we've gotten in that mode to this point had a slightly less deep agenda. And we're working our way through the rest.","So I don't think there's much impact in terms of the external environment, in terms of the objective that we have laid out to get 85% of our businesses in that mode by the end of this year. That being said, certainly, the external environment, from the standpoint of yield on that investment, is certainly going to have an impact in the short run. A little bit of tailwind, at some point here, would certainly help us showcase the progress we're making, but I think I'd also make the other point that the fact that we're able to grow 45% of our sales in this environment at a 6% clip in 2015 is a pretty good indicator of at least some progress in that regard.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for that, Scott. And Scott or Michael, can I ask you about price\/cost? You had a minor improvement in price\/cost from 20 basis points to 30 basis points. But as you know, raw material costs do seem to be coming down, maybe a little more significantly now. So can you actually improve that price\/cost from 30 basis points that you had in 1Q or at least maintain it for the year?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so I think obviously, Andrew, it's not the main driver of our margin performance here. That's really enterprise initiatives. But we were pleased to see 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. That was our best result in 2015. And the average for the year is 20 basis points. And that's what we modeled for 2016.","I think we were all encouraged to see solid price across the portfolio, again, a lot of it driven by the launch of new products, as we've talked about before. And we're starting to see the deflation come through on some of the key raw materials that we're buying. In some cases, we pass those on to customers; we're contractually obligated, so obviously, we'll do that. But there is a little bit more of sort of an improvement in the overall equation here in the fourth quarter. Hopeful that we can maintain that. We're certainly working very hard on that. And we're counting on 20 basis points in the guide for 2016.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Michael. Take care, guys.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks very much. Okay, so I want to \u2013 good morning, everyone. I want to pick up on this auto thematic. I mean, let's be blunt. It was very clear your stock was shorted earlier this year, because of this perceived exposure, your Auto business is going to fall off a cliff. And I understand your confidence based on your track record and your ability to continue to penetrate it. My question is, do you see anything, Scott or Michael, based on your operations that give you a little more comfort than simply the trend? In other words, do you have \u2013 and I realize you've got a little bit of a backlog, look forward, but are there initiatives that you're working on that may be derivative of, say, CAFE standards or vehicle electrification, or you're working on a big something in Indonesia or something like that that you think maybe give you \u2013 maybe not dramatically, but like a point or two of step-up help over the coming cycle?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I wouldn't put Indonesia on the high priority list.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just meant \u2013 that was the only thing that came to mind, but you know.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But other than that, I think we have \u2013 I think I get it, your question. If I don't answer it, let me know. But what I would say is we have a very full pipeline over of engineering and product development activity related to Automotive that's certainly driven by some of the things you talked about, and just other changes in the need profile of our OEM customers in terms of new features, new technologies, new things that they're looking to add.","So I think we have a very solid view of the next 10 years in the space, in terms of what the opportunities are for our particular niche in the space. And I think that's \u2013 this is not \u2013 we don't manage any of our businesses for the next two quarters, we manage them for the long haul. I think this is an area where we remain, as we've talked before, very optimistic about our ability to continue to increase our content per vehicle, focusing on a very narrowly defined strategy in terms of what we do.","And so, all I can tell you is that the pipeline, in terms of the amount of activity in terms of projects we're working on that are going to come to fruition two years and three years and four years out remains very healthy. We track it, we monitor it, so I think we are on top of sort of what the future might hold in terms of opportunity for us here.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And John, maybe I'll just add that, for those that are maybe a little more short-term focused, we have not seen any signs of a slowdown in the fourth quarter or year-to-date in the automotive space, or across our business portfolio.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Let me just ask kind of a follow-up. This German company you've bought, right, it's going to give you a leg up into Asia. And obviously, ITW, as you're pivoting with cost and simplification, you're going to be doing more M&A. Is there runway to do other kinds of deals like this, perhaps to extend what clearly is then a successful M&A \u2013 or excuse me, penetration track record in auto into other markets like, I don't know, for example, Japan or something.","I mean just I realize you can't talk specifically, but maybe the question was more the deal that you did, was it more one-off? Or do you think that there are other things? And just as a follow-up, I mean having a little bit of experience with German companies, I'm assuming that company has a lot of potential productivity or cost efficiency opportunities. Can you still grow it at that cadence and expand the margins?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Trying to think about where to start with that one?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry. Multi-part second part.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so I think our overall story in Automotive is largely an organic one. I think this particular business, from the standpoint of complementary fit with our strategy, is a unique opportunity. I would certainly not rule out other opportunities like this. But I think it's not a matter of \u2013 it's not the scale we're after here. It's really about sort of auto opportunities where we can extend our access to the key OEMs and extend our ability to play across a range of different product platforms that we think fit the overall screen in terms of high value-added content.","So we talked about the organic growth rate in Auto OEM. I think that's largely that remains the thrust here. So that's the overall focus, and the story is we have significant opportunity to continue to grow and add content per vehicle and do it in a way that's certainly consistent with our overall enterprise performance goals.","That being said, would we look at something that gave us a similar opportunity to extend our reach in some other geography? Sure.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Or technology, perhaps? I mean, I won't \u2013 Mobileye comes to mind only because it's been so topical. I'm not talking about that company specifically, but maybe break-through technology. Is that a possibility?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure I heard who the company was. I wouldn't comment on it. I don't think it's \u2013 I think we'll assess each opportunity on its own. I don't want to overplay this. I think our primary thrust is \u2013 and focus continues to be on leveraging and executing the strategy that we have. So we don't need any more M&A to continue to generate really strong organic growth at really nice incremental yield. So I would say, our thrust here would be more opportunistic than any view that we have to do anything more here. So if opportunities present themselves that we think that will certainly do it, but we have no particular view of we're deficient, we need this, or we have to have that in order to be very successful here over the long haul.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, I got it. And Mobileye was the company I called out. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm new to your story, so I'm allowed to ask dumb questions for a couple of quarters. I hope you guys forgive me.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But can you give us a sense \u2013 you seem to have a fair amount of confidence in the 0% to 2% 1Q guide. I mean, January is a fairly important month in the quarter. We're already on this 27th. Are you tracking in that range in January and that gives you the confidence?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Scott, we're on track in January for the guidance that we gave for the first quarter.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, second question, just following up a little on what John was saying. I mean, this TRW deal looks like just a fantastic deal. I mean, if there's other stuff out there like this, would you be willing to \u2013 I mean, would it make sense, at least, to think about not doing the share repurchase and adding the higher return profile instead?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think, Scott, we really \u2013 absolutely, we will continue to look at acquisitions, where we can \u2013 that meet the criteria that we talked about in December. So really, the primary purpose here is to support or accelerate our organic growth rate and we're looking for businesses, where we can have significant impact from an 80\/20 standpoint. And so to the extent that we see those, we'll certainly continue to work on that.","In terms of overall capital allocation, nothing has changed in terms of our structure and strategy. As you know, we have a strong balance sheet, we have strong liquidity. We generate a lot of cash flow. You saw 140% in the quarter, 106% for the year. And so we have a lot of options. And so for us, it's not a question of either\/or, we can do all of the above. And what we've said is to the extent that we don't identify acquisitions that meet the criteria that I just described, then we make a choice to return that cash to our shareholders through an active share repurchase program. And as you saw, we just raised that today from a $1 billion to $2 billion for 2016. So that's how we think about it.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That seems to make sense. And then, just a quick one. How much of the 150-basis-point margin of the year you think was price\/cost related or LIFO accounting related, or something related to that?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So price\/cost was 20 basis points and the primary driver was 110 basis points from the enterprise initiatives.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. All right, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Thank you.","Operator; Thank you. And our next question will be coming from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. I just want to circle back to the ZF deal. Scott, it's pretty clear this is a natural fit for you guys, but I didn't hear any specifics regarding what the products are. There's a vague description of strategic product platforms, but if you can get down to the level of the 80\/20, the 20% that really matter compared to like lift-to-sits, handles, fuel caps, what is it adding to the portfolio and are there any redundancies?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, this is Michael, Deane. So if you think about it, $470 million in revenues, half of that is what we would describe as fastening systems. And that, not to get too technical here, certainly, I'm not the right person for that, but they're described broadly as fasteners for trim, pipe and hose, hole plugs and wire harnesses. The other half is what is described as technical components. So this is, again, in the interior of the vehicle \u2013 air registers, interior ventilation systems, lighting and other interior products. So there's a really nice fit with what we know really well and do very well inside of our current Automotive business.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just in the description, Michael, there are overlaps, the way it sounds, in terms of the fasteners and even some of the air handling. Do you have a sense of how much specific overlap there is?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think overlap is not a good characterization. Every one of these products is custom-designed around a particular model. So we're sort of describing them in broad category, so they're areas that we know. We know fastening very well in Automotive, but there are hundreds of fastening applications on every car. So every product line here is a specifically designed and engineered solution to a specific problem on a specific model for a specific OEM. So these are sort of areas that we're very familiar with in broad terms, but from the standpoint of are there any exact like-like products? Minimal to none.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great to hear. And that's a good perspective. And then, just my follow-up question would be for Michael. On the repatriated cash, what's the effective tax rate that you paid on bringing this cash back? And maybe are you netting it against any tax losses? But just when you say it's tax-efficient, what did you have to pay?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So we paid very little. And you saw that in our tax rate last year. We had a similar transaction in the quarter last year. Our rate for the last year was 30.2% for the year, in that 30% to 31% range. And for 2016, we expect to be in that same range, 30% to 31%, including in the first quarter. So, like we said, this was done in a very tax-efficient, very simple transaction. It makes a lot of sense operationally and a really good outcome for the company.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And, Michael, I'm sorry to try to pin you down on this. When you say very little, what tax rate \u2013 effective tax rate are you paying to bring this cash back?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Essentially zero.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Terrific. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Mig Dobre of Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, my question relates to slide 11 in the deck, looking at industrial and consumer sequentially. So for your industrial businesses, you're up 4% adjusted for seasonality. Maybe kind of nitpicking a little bit, if Welding was flat and Test & Measurement were up 2%, can you give us a sense for what else sort of grew to get you to the plus 4%?","And then, related to this, I'm trying to understand if this is just something that's specific to the company, either through new product introduction or your exposure? Or are you trying to signal that there's something bigger going on in the environment? It's a little different than what we're hearing from other industrial companies in terms of what happens...","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Mig, all we're saying is that, as we talked about on the last earnings call is that what we have seen in our businesses on the industrial side is that trends stabilize, really starting in the second quarter last year. And so if you just take Welding to maybe illustrate this, so if you look at the sequential demand trends in Welding, what we saw in the first quarter was a 8% decline in the demand rate, into the second quarter, into the third quarter, we saw 1%, all seasonally adjusted. And then, in the fourth quarter we saw flat. And so that means that we would expect typical seasonality in Welding. We expect that business to be down 2% and the business was flat. So that's certainly an improvement in terms of the underlying demand trends.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And part of what I would add to that is there's a lot of volatility in the comps, given just the volatility in the end-market. So we talked about fourth quarter last year. So what we're trying just communicate is, not any big change in trend as much as when you look at the year-on-year comps quarter-by-quarter, because of the volatility over the last eight quarters to 10 quarters, those aren't necessarily indicative of what's going on currently. And essentially what we're seeing is relatively stable demand on a orders per day basis. So we're not calling it a trend, we're not calling it a pick-up, but what we are saying is things have been relatively stable.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, and, Mig, a point on the consumer side is really that -this is a little bit different, as you were saying, relative to maybe some of our peers, that 60% of our revenues are tied to the consumer. And that in the current environment where there's some pressure on the industrial side, particularly, CapEx into oil and gas, and we have 60% of the company growing at 3% at a very stable rate for the quarter and for the year. So those are the points we're trying to make on slide 11.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, I know you commented on price\/cost, but if we can focus on just price specifically in your industrial businesses, are there some parallels that you can draw between the current environment versus maybe prior downturns where things were challenging? How's pricing behaving versus history here?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No change here, Mig. I mean, we saw across the portfolio the ability to get price based on offering value-added products and solutions. We saw no change in the quarter. So really nothing different here.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Hi, good morning.","Operator","Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","So, two questions, one positive, I guess, one negative. But first a clarification. Maybe I missed it.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for the warning.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","The guidance, does it not include the auto acquisition, just so we're clear?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, the guidance today does not include the acquisition. But what we did say is that we expect minimal EPS impact in 2016. This is really more of a 2017 and beyond EPS growth story. And so when the transaction closes, which we expect will happen in the first half of the year, we will update revenue margin guidance. We expect some, but very little impact on the EPS side and we'll give you all that once the transaction closes.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","All right. Thank you. On the positive side, the organic growth guidance for the first quarter was stronger than I would have thought. Is it fair to say the tone at the December meeting when you thought about the cadence for 2016 organic to get to the full-year midpoint of up 2%, that the first quarter organic guidance you just gave is maybe a little better than you were thinking a month or two ago?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'd say not really, David. I mean, I'd say, the fourth quarter here was a little bit better than our guidance at the beginning of the quarter, but that wasn't really a big surprise to us. And, again, what we're doing is we're taking typical seasonality, run rates from Q4 adjusted for seasonality into Q1 and that gets you into that 0% to 2% range, so there's nothing really different about it.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Okay, I have to admit, I was thinking that it was a very back half loaded guide in the sense of first half organic maybe down a bit, second half would have to be up a lot. But it sounds like now the cadence sounds a little more 1%,1%, 3%,3%, is kind of the generic base case of the cadence to get the full-year 2%?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, yeah, but again, it's much more about the \u2013 because of the comparison to the comps, we're taking current daily run rates and applying basically what we're saying in 2016 is \u2013 no change in current run rates gets us 1% to 3% for the year.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And so based on that, I mean, the way you're looking at it, David, I mean, this is not a back-end loaded plan in terms of the organic or the EPS guidance.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Yeah, I mean, I will say I left the meeting thinking it was even more back-half loaded than the setup you're describing today.","On the negative side, obviously, a lot of positive commentary you have on Auto versus the concerns, but still, end of the day, the quarter, the outgrowth wasn't quite as great as we've seen, and the margins still were down, so maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks. But can you help us understand why the margin was down and how do you see Auto margins for 2016 versus 2015? You're saying worldwide builds up 1%. I assume you expect to outgrow, so call it, 2%, 3%, 4% kind of revenue growth for Auto. How do the margins play out in that scenario?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So our margins, I mean, it can vary a little bit on a quarterly basis. I would point to 24.2% operating margin in Auto for the year, great progress. That's how I would think about 2016 with some progress on the enterprise initiatives. For the year, 6% organic growth on builds of 1%, 5% in the quarter. There can be some mix issues, like we talked about in the third quarter. And so I wouldn't read too much into, David, the one particular quarter, but really encourage you to look at it kind of on an annual basis. And we'd certainly expect something very similar in 2016. Scott walked through the penetration and the auto build dynamics, but it should be another solid year for the Auto business.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","That's helpful, but just so I make sure I heard you correctly, the 24.2%, and then you made a comment about enterprise initiatives. The 24.2% includes enterprise initiatives, or is that base, and then whatever you can provide (50:22).","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The 24.2% is the performance for the full-year in 2015.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Correct.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And like all of our businesses, we would expect some progress on margins in 2016, some more than others.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Okay. that's helpful. Helpful. Just wanted to clarify. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Joel Tiss. Your line is open.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey guys, how's it going?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just quick for Mike, just a clarification. You said the consumer facing businesses are stable. Does that mean that they're up 3%? They're stable at an up 3% run rate for 2016, or they're stable closer to flat for 2016 versus the up 3% in 2015?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, when we say stable what we mean is the underlying demand trends adjusted for seasonality from Q3 to Q4, we saw stable demand in those businesses. So...","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And you said \u2013 oh, go ahead, sorry.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Now it doesn't mean that we expect the consumer businesses to be flat in 2016. We're certainly not giving guidance for consumer and industrial for 2016, but if you think about what's in there, so Automotive, we talked about Food Equipment, we talked about parts of Construction and Specialty, we'd certainly expect those businesses to grow again in 2016.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, just a strategic question on the debt. You were saying in December that you were hoping to use the free cash flow to pay down debt. And I see that your cash is coming down a little bit, and your debt's going up. And I just wondered if there's any change in that thinking going into 2016?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think, Joel, I think you were saying that. I don't think I said that at the December meeting. So we have, like I said earlier, I mean, we have our current debt to EBITDA is in that 2.2\/2.3 range, and we expect no changes to that.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First question on the acquisition. Could you help us kind of frame the historical growth rate over the last three years? Was it even close to the 8% CAGR achieved by your Auto business? And then, also based on your initial meetings with the organization over there so far, is your impression that they have the embedded skill-set right now to drive both margin improvement, and ultimately, above market growth kind of in line with corporate goals?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So the answer to the first question is the growth rate has been solid, but not at the rate that we've been growing over the last four years. We expect to have some \u2013 offer some help in that regard. And then, the second question is that we've been very impressed with the management team in the organization and feel like we're getting a really solid quality team, that runs a great business today and through some additional tools that we can provide around our operating system, I think, can certainly leverage those tools to their full potential.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Scott. And then, last one back on Welding, your comments about that being one of the businesses that stabilized during at least the second half of last year. Did you see any difference in trends through the year between CapEx and consumables? And then, also did you see any change within the second half in some of your bigger customers, maybe machinery OEM behavior versus, if you will, the general distributor base.","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, no, so we didn't really see anything other than what I described earlier, right? And so, on the equipment side, certainly down a little bit more than the consumables that have been fairly stable throughout the year, but no significant changes as we've gone through the year or the fourth quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. Sorry about the last name, there.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It's okay. I'm used to it. It's DeBlase. So the first question is on Construction. So the North America Construction Products core growth, I think, it decelerated a bit to 2% this quarter. It was more like 7% in 3Q. I'm just curious on the drivers, is it a comp issue? Are you seeing some slowdown in North America Construction on an underlying basis? And then, I guess, what are your thoughts on the North America non-resi construction side goal into 2016?","Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So if you look at the fourth quarter, up 3% organic, like I said, residential was flat, which was slightly better than expected. On the renovation remodel channel, that's really where the growth, up 12% for the full-year, and then, commercial down slightly. Those trends, we've been kind of bumping along those same numbers in 2015. We feel good about 2016 and we would expect that business to grow in 2016 at a rate similar to what we saw in 2015, which was up 4% organically.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then, for my follow-up, just looking at the T&M\/Electronics business, it was pretty strong this quarter, stronger than we had expected. And I would say that the margin performance there was a bit of a standout. So is that just enterprise initiatives? Or is there anything else to highlight from a margin perspective? And do you also think that T&M\/Electronics can show positive margin progression in 2016?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, we think we'll continue to make progress on operating margin in Test & Measurement. And in the fourth quarter, really nothing unusual other than what we've been talking about for almost three years now in terms of really strong execution of the enterprise initiatives, including 80\/20 in that business. So very sustainable. More progress to come in 2016 and 2017.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. One, again, the comments you made about the sequential improvements in some of your industrial businesses was interesting. Can you comment on if that trend continued into January? And then, I guess, the second question is given the incremental lag-down we've seen in oil prices, what have you sort of baked into your guidance in 2016 in terms of risk, because you could see a lag effect there? Thanks.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So like we said earlier, no change in the month of January. We're on track to the guidance for the quarter. Oil and gas demand, while certainly down year-over-year, has remained stable. And like we said earlier, the primary impact there is on the Welding side and we expect that business to decline in the single-digits in 2016.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All righty. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, it would be helpful if they could get my first name right. Morning. Just following up on the acquisition of ZF, as they would call it in Europe, how did that deal come about? For decades companies have been trying to get out of automotive supply. And it hasn't been deemed as a very attractive sector to be in. I'm curious, was this an auction process? ZF was trying to get rid of this business? Or did ITW approach ZF? I'm just curious how it all happened.","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'm not sure that it's probably our place to comment on that. I think we're \u2013 it's a business that we've known about for a long time. I'll put it that way.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So you're not willing to comment on whether it was an auction?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You can ask them.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. No problem. And maybe you could just talk about the backlog then on the acquisition front? What are you seeing out there in terms of buyers versus sellers? Are we still looking at high expectations from sellers?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, my answer is we remain very much a niche player on the acquisition space. As we've talked about, our primary thrust remains on focus on making this pivot organic. So I'm not sure we're your best barometer. In terms of pipeline, we have a few segments that are in the ready-to-grow mode, largely who are now enabled to start to think about what might be complementary to what they're doing, but I would say, from a standpoint of our overall level of effort here, we wouldn't be a good barometer in terms of what's going on in the overall market.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there in the interest of time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Steve Fisher of UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Just two regional outlook questions. On Europe, we're seeing some mixed data points. What are you seeing and expecting for your overall business in aggregate in Europe in 2016? And then, similarly, with China, obviously, roughly, flat in the fourth quarter, but you had some big moving pieces with Automotive, quite a bit something else was down. How do you see China going forward in 2016 overall?","Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so I think, Steve, kind of, big picture here. I mean, Europe was up a little more than 1% in 2015. We expect that to stay at the current run rate to be \u2013 in that range. Maybe a little better than that, driven, again, by strong presence in Automotive growing double-digits, or a big quarter in 2015, and more to come there. Food Equipment should have another really good year in that region. So more of the same, maybe a little bit better in Europe based on current run rates. China was flat essentially in the quarter, flat for the year. And we expect a similar environment going into 2016.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. And that brings us actually just past the top of the hour. So we're going to conclude the call there.

Brooklier","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 conference call. As is our normal practice, our CEO, David Speer; and CFO, Ron Kropp, have joined me to discuss our first quarter financial results, as well as our 2012 earnings forecast.","Here's the agenda for today's call. David will provide some brief commentary on 3 important long-term initiatives we have launched in the company, as well as discuss some first quarter highlights. Ron will then cover our Q1 financial results in much more detail. I'll come back and talk about our first quarter geographic and segment results, and then Ron will cover our 2012 Q2 and full year forecast. Finally, we will open the call to your questions.

This presentation contains our financial forecast for 2012 second quarter and full year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on Slide 2.  We refer you to the company's 10-K for 2011 for more detail about the important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

No pass code is necessary. Playback number will be available until 12 midnight on May 8, 2012.","Now let me introduce David Speer. David?","David B. Speer","Thank you, John. Before we address our first quarter results, let me make some brief comments on 3 very important long-term company initiatives that we've recently undertaken.","We've received a number of investor questions on these topics over the past few months, and we want to share with you what we can at this point. The 3 areas of focus include: our business structure simplification initiative, our strategic sourcing initiative and our portfolio management initiative.","First of all, our business structure simplification initiative will essentially result in generally larger-scale businesses within our decentralized operating structure. These are businesses, in most cases, with similar customers, markets and products where we can improve focus, while driving better operating efficiencies and lowering overhead costs.  As this process unfolds, you should expect to see larger ITW businesses of roughly $100 million annual revenues. Internally, we're referring to this as our own 80\/20 review of our business structure. We're excited about its long-term benefits for ITW, but we'll move cautiously to ensure we maintain our strong customer and market interfaces that have been a hallmark of our success.","Secondly, we have hired an experienced consultant to help us develop approaches to better leverage our opportunities for strategic sourcing initiatives across the company. We're in the later stages of gathering data, but we believe this ongoing initiative will add significant value in terms of how we purchase key raw materials such as steel, resins and chemicals, as well as services such as energy, transportation and logistics and other major cost categories.","Finally, our portfolio management initiative is built around our long-term strategy to divest assets that we no longer consider core and will allow us to focus on key core business opportunities, with strong growth and returns that will help us maximize our long-term returns.","The April sale of our $375 million finishing businesses to Graco is the most recent example of our commitment to proactive portfolio management. I would like to add that our management team and company are fully committed to all of these initiatives. These are multi-year programs that will enhance our decentralized operating structure. We expect the associated strategic benefits and savings from these initiatives will be significant, and we anticipate communicating some reasonable details around these initiatives before the end of 2012.","Now moving on to the first quarter. We believe we delivered very solid results, especially in light of the uneven macro environment. As you will see, our North American businesses produced strong results, while international businesses reflected slower market conditions, primarily in Europe and Asia.","It's worth noting that Europe end-market conditions have met our expectations for the first quarter. It's also notable that both our EPS performance and operating margins exceeded our expectations.  Congratulations to our people for a job well done in the quarter.","Now let me turn it over to Ronald Kropp, who will discuss the recent quarter in greater detail. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Here are the highlights for the first quarter.","Revenues increased 6.4% due to higher base revenues and acquisitions. Operating income was $705 million, which was higher than last year at $46 million, representing growth of 7%. Operating margins of 15.5% were 10 basis points higher compared to last year.","Diluted income per share from continuing operations was $0.97, which was at the high end of our forecast range of $0.89 to $0.97. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.24 lower than last year, which included a onetime tax benefit of $0.33 related to a Q1 2001 Australian tax case. Excluding last year's tax benefit, Q1's earnings per share were higher than last year by $0.09, or 10.2%.","Finally, free operating cash flow was $239 million for the quarter. Now let's go to the components of our operating results.","Our 6.4% revenue increase was primarily due to the following factors: base revenues were up 3.2%, with North American base revenues increasing 6.6% and mixed international base revenues that were essentially flat overall. John will discuss the geographic mix in more detail later in the call.","Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.4% to revenue growth, and currency translation decreased revenues by 1.3%. Operating margins for the first quarter of 15.5% were 10 basis points higher than Q1 2001 -- 2011. Base business margins increased 120 basis points, with higher sales volume contributing 80 basis points. The positive impact of non-volume items increased base margins by 40 basis points versus last year, primarily due to price cost favorability.","In addition, margins were lower by 60 basis points due to higher restructuring expenses versus last year, and the dilutive impact of acquisitions reduced margins by 50 basis points. The net margins from acquisitions, excluding amortization and other acquisition accounting, were 14.5%.","Looking at working capital and cash flow, accounts receivable DSO of 62 days was slightly higher than last year, and inventory months on hand was flat at 1.9 months. ROIC for the first quarter was 15.1%, which was 60 basis points lower than Q1 last year. Our ROIC continues to run at our 15% to 17% target range, which is significantly above our cost of capital of 9% to 10%.","For the first quarter, cash provided from operating activities was $323 million, with capital expenditures of $84 million, resulting in free operating cash flow of $239 million. This was $183 million better than Q1 of the prior year. As discussed in our January earnings call, we expect to generate more than $2 billion of free operating cash flow for 2012.","I would now like to make a few comments regarding our capital structure. First of all, our capital allocation priorities are as follows: our first priority for capital continues to be organic investments, especially related to our key growth platforms in emerging markets. Examples of organic investments include R&D spending, new CapEx projects such as additional manufacturing capacity in emerging markets and restructuring projects, which have long-term margin benefits.","Our next capital priority is dividends. We have a dividend policy of 30% to 45% of the trailing 2 years free operating cash flow. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $174 million.","Any excess capital after organic investments and dividends are used for external investments, either share repurchases or acquisitions. We evaluate the allocation between these investments based on the best risk-adjusted returns.","During Q1, we spent $474 million to repurchase 8.5 million shares. In addition, we utilized $481 million for acquisitions, led by the Brooks Instrument business and the test and measurement growth platform. Brooks has annualized revenues of $210 million.","Overall, during Q1, we returned over $600 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As of the end of Q1, we have approximately $3.4 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under our buyback program.","Our debt levels increased $775 million during the quarter, with our debt-to-capital ratio at 32% and our debt-to-EBITDA at 1.4x. We have overseas cash of $1.3 billion and plenty of debt capacity to make additional investments.","We were pleased to complete the sale of our industrial finishing businesses to Graco on April 2 in a $650-million cash transaction. We estimate the pretax gain on the sale to be approximately $450 million, which we will record in the second quarter as part of discontinued operations. The finishing equipment businesses consist of paint spray systems and technologies for a variety of industrial end markets and applications around the world.","As we have said before, acquisitions will remain a key part of our growth strategy, but we will continue to selectively divest businesses that no longer fit our core platforms or our long-term growth and return objectives.","I will now turn it back over to John, who'll provide more details on the operating results as he discusses the results by geography and individual segment.","John L. Brooklier","Thank you, Ron. Before I get to the actual segment highlights, let me take a moment to review our Q1 geographic trends.","There was a not-so-surprising theme that emerged from our Q1 results. It's clear our North American businesses were the outperformers in the quarter, producing organic revenue growth of 7%.","I should note that Q1 industrial production levels in the United States were at mid-single digit levels during the quarter.","Given the mix of macro data we have seen from Europe and Asia Pacific in Q1, it's not surprising that our international organic revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. Organic revenues in Asia Pacific increased 3%, while Europe and South America showed modest declines in organic revenues.","As David noted earlier, while European organic revenues were modestly negative in Q1, our businesses in Europe largely performed at forecasted levels.","Now let me move to the segment data. As you'll note from our new slide presentation deck accompanying the conference call, we have all of our segment data essentially contained on one slide now, so my comments will relate to this particular slide.","In Transportation, this segment largely consists of our auto OEM businesses, with smaller revenue contributions from our auto aftermarket and truck remanufacturing business. Segment organic revenues grew 5.1% in Q1. For the biggest piece of the business, auto OEM, auto builds continue to be a key driver of revenue growth.","While worldwide auto builds grew 5% in the quarter versus a year-ago period, our worldwide auto businesses produced organic revenues of approximately 7% growth. We also delivered positive organic revenue growth for all 3 major regions: North America, Europe and Asia. And notably, even though European auto builds declined 4% in Q1, our organic revenues grew 6%. So while some of this outsized performance was due to favorable customer mix, it also exemplifies the strong product penetration we have contained within the auto OEM business.","In auto aftermarket, our worldwide organic revenues declined about 50 basis points in Q1, as warm weather impacted windshield wiper blades or our Rain-X brand. Now we encourage people to go out and buy as many windshield wiper blades as possible.","In our truck remanufacturing business, our organic revenues grew 7.4%, thanks to strong energy development activity in Canada and Western United States.","Moving to our Power Systems and Electronics segment, we continue to see very strong demand from our welding customers, while our electronics businesses experienced the reverse. Segment organic revenues grew roughly 7% in the quarter.","Covering welding first, our worldwide organic revenues grew a very strong 18.6%, with North American organic revenues increasing 19.9% and international organic revenues growing 15%. As in past quarters, strong demand from global heavy equipment manufacturers, such as Caterpillar and John Deere as well as energy projects, continue to drive welding's double-digit organic growth performance. They continue to have very, very good performance.","In electronics, the story was far less positive. Total electronic organic revenues declined roughly 10% as our businesses were hampered by weak worldwide consumer demand for products, as well as some destocking related to these products. The better news is that we continue to be involved in major capital equipment projects with Apple. This will help our financial results for our electronics businesses as the year progresses.","Moving to Industrial Packaging. Our businesses largely reflected industrial production trends in the major geographies. Put simply, North America was stronger and the rest of the world was weaker. Segment organic revenues grew approximately 2% in the quarter.","In aggregate, our total North American Industrial Packaging organic revenues grew 8.4%, while our total international Industrial Packaging organic revenues declined 2.4%.","In our Signode steel and plastic strapping equipment businesses, worldwide organic revenues declined 60 basis points in the quarter. And by geography, international organic revenues fell 3.6%, while North American organic revenues increased 4.8%. The better news was in our Protective and Stretch Packaging businesses, which grew organic revenues 9.5% and 6.1%, respectively.","Moving to Food Equipment. Equipment sales were strong in North America and weaker in Europe and the rest of the world. In total, segment organic revenues grew 1.6% in the quarter.","Moving to the North American part of Food Equipment, organic revenues grew roughly 7% in Q1, as equipment sales increased 6.9% and service sales grew 6.5%. Warewash and food machines for casual dining restaurants and supermarkets performed very well in the quarter. And the growth in service is largely attributable to productivity enhancements from our field technicians.","Once again, it was a different story internationally, where total organic revenues declined 3.8% in the quarter. International equipment sales declined 5.6%, largely due to weakness in cooking products for institutional customers in both France and Italy. Underlying this were project deferrals and lack of government spending, which impact the revenues. On a related note, international service organic revenues were essentially flat in the quarter.","Moving to our Construction segment, it was, once again, a tale of 2 geographies. Our Construction results were positive in North America and declined in Europe and the rest of the world. Please remember, though, that because our segment revenues are more weighted to international construction markets, segment revenues only grew roughly 1 point in the first quarter.","Total North American Construction organic revenues increased 8.4% in Q1, with the renovation and commercial categories growing 12% and 7.3%, respectively. For the residential category, our organic revenues grew 7% in Q1, and we continue to believe that 2012 housing starts will average approximately 700,000 units for the year and represent a firmer foundation for improved housing builds on a multi-year go-forward basis.","Moving to international, organic revenues declined 2.5% in the quarter, with European organic revenues decreasing 1.4% and Asia-Pacific declining almost 4%. Once again, while Europe grabs all the headlines, a bigger issue in Q1, international construction, was the weakening economic construction environment in Australia and New Zealand.","In our Polymers and Fluids segment, organic growth in polymers and hygiene was positive, while organic growth for fluids was negative. As a result, segment organic revenues grew approximately 2% in the quarter.","Very quickly, in polymers and hygiene, organic revenues were up 3.3% due to increased worldwide demand in both categories. Polymer organic revenues grew 4%, and hygiene organic revenues increased roughly 3%. In fluids, organic revenues declined 1.4% in the quarter, largely due to reduced sales for some of our MRO-related products and the impact of recession in Spain.","Moving to our other construction-related segment, Decorative Surfaces, we generated reasonably strong organic revenue performance from our businesses in an assortment of geographies. Segment organic revenues grew 4.3% in the quarter.","In North America, our Wilsonart high-pressure laminate business produced solid organic revenue growth of 4.4%, thanks to innovation and new product designs and ongoing penetration in commercial categories such as office furniture and retail outlets.","Internationally, our Decorative Surface business generated organic revenue growth of 4.3%. In Europe, our businesses in France and Germany contributed to organic growth. And in Asia Pacific, our Decorative Surfaces business in Thailand and China produced strong organic revenue increase.","So as you can see from this particular segment, just saying Europe's down on a more macro basis doesn't account for some of the activity we have in businesses where we can actually get good results in Europe. And I'll point you back to what we did on the auto area, where our European auto business actually outperformed build metrics there.","Finally, in our All Other segment, we had varying levels of contributions from our test and measurement, appliance and consumer packaging businesses. Segment organic revenues grew roughly 1% in the quarter.","In test and measurement, organic revenues were up 5% as CapEx spend for structural testing equipment cooled a bit in the quarter, especially on the international side. In appliance, organic revenues increased 7.1% due to better consumer demand in the North American appliance sector. We also increased our penetration with some of Whirlpool's top-load high-efficiency washer products.","And finally, in the consumer packaging area, organic revenues declined 1.6%, due to flat performance from our multi-pack businesses and a decline in our decorating businesses.","So at this point, I'll conclude my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Ron, who will cover our 2012 forecast. Ron?","Ronald D. Kropp","Thanks, John. For the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting diluted income per share from continuing operations to be within a range of $1.08 to $1.16. This range assumes an increase in total revenues of 3.5% to 6%. The midpoint of the Q2 diluted EPS range of $1.12 would represent a growth of 16% versus last year.","For the full year 2012, our forecasted EPS range for continuing operations is now $4.14 to $4.38. This range assumes a total revenue increase of 5% to 7%.  The EPS midpoint of $4.26 would be 13% higher than 2011, excluding the Q1 2011 tax benefit of $0.33.  This EPS midpoint is $0.12 higher than our previous forecast from January and is driven by the first quarter $0.04 outperformance, plus an $0.08 benefit from completed and forecasted share repurchases. In addition, the benefit of $0.03 from better-than-originally-expected base business performance is offset by higher projected restructuring costs, which took away $0.03.","I will now turn it back over to John for the Q&A.","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Ron. Now we'll open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll start the questioning now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first one comes from Andy Kaplowitz.","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Alan Fleming standing in for Andy this morning. I wanted to ask you about your 2012 revenue outlook. It seems like you brought -- you did bring the top end of the range down a little bit. Wanted to see if that's more conservative, kind of given the uneven macro environment? Or are you seeing particular softness in some markets, if you could comment on that?","David B. Speer","Well, I think our comment would be -- what we've seen in the first quarter was clearly softer markets in Asia, and I think that's what we're really, as we look forward, are projecting forward. As John said earlier, the European performance was largely in line with what we expected. But I think the big delta from a geographic standpoint in our revised guidance is more about what we see happening in Asia, which has proven to be somewhat weaker in the beginning of the year than what we had anticipated. And at this time, we don't really see any catalyst that suggests it's going to get significantly stronger during the year.","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Wanted to ask one follow-up. What are you seeing in terms of price cost? Is there any change in your outlook from last quarter throughout the balance of the year? Are you seeing improved price costs? Do you still expect next quarter to be kind of the best quarter for price cost?","Ronald D. Kropp","So as we talked about when we put our guidance at the beginning of the year, we expected to have favorable price cost this year, assuming that raw materials kind of stayed where they were at. So in the first quarter, it was a little bit better than we expected. That's 40 basis points positive. And we're looking, as we look out at the rest of the year, that the full year would be a similar amount, 30% to 40% -- 30 to 40 basis points positive. From a raw materials side, it's a bit of a mixed bag. Resin has been up significantly, especially PET and polypropylene. Steel has been pretty stable. Stable -- flat to down in the quarter, but pretty stable from an outlook perspective as well. And chemicals has been up 3% to 5%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","It's Vertical Research Partners. Just a couple of quick questions. Is there any issue at all from the Evonik, the CDT resin, either directly in your products, or just indirectly on auto build that you've heard about yet?","John L. Brooklier","I'll take the question, Rob. We've checked with our auto people, and what they're telling us right now is that there's no impact on our business. We have very little to do with the actual nylon 12 that's actually part of, I think, principally, brake linings. So very little to do with us directly. Clearly, we would be more interested in what's going to happen in a non-direct way with OEMs and what it does to overall production. What we're hearing and what we're seeing currently is that the OEMs are getting together, and they're trying to get additional information, trying to source additional materials and doesn't seem to be any immediate impact. We believe there's enough inventory in the channel right now to handle this. But we'll keep you posted if we hear anything differently.","David B. Speer","Really about what happens to them and their production. Is not a material that we're using directly. But obviously, their extent to build vehicles will impact us if the shortage ends up cutting their production.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","For sure. Okay. And then just a quick one on food service. I had the impression you'd lost a little bit of share, maybe falsely, but just confirm what we heard in the channel in the U.S. over the past year or 2. Have you -- are you gaining share? Or are you sort of up in line with the industry, you think, this quarter?","David B. Speer","Well, I think it depends on the segment. I mean, if you're looking at the institutional segment, which is a big segment for us, there's no question that it's been an uneven environment for the last several years, because a lot of those projects are funded by government sources, and the government funding has been uneven at best. So that's a category that's been quite volatile, if you will, from an equipment spend situation. I would say, in the casual dining category, I would not characterize what we've done or what our performance has been as a loss of any share. But I can tell you that as that category looks at equipment replacements and menu changes and so forth, it does impact how equipment rolls out in those categories. So it's not an even process. But I would say, overall, right now, I don't think I would characterize us having lost any significant share positions.","John L. Brooklier","Rob, I would point you back to the numbers I gave earlier when you talk about North America. Our North America organic revenues grew approximately 7% in the quarter, and both equipment and sales were up roughly 7%. So I think that...","David B. Speer","Which would have been our strongest quarter in some time.","John L. Brooklier","Yes, one of our better quarters. So I think that, that -- I think that our Food Equipment people are encouraged by what they see in Q1, and they're going to try to build on that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jamie Cook.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Two questions. One, on the lower, slightly lower sales forecast. Can you just talk about whether there's any change in your incremental margin assumptions with and without restructuring and acquisitions? And then I just guess, my second point, just in term -- questions, longer term in terms of your longer-term initiatives that you talked about in the beginning of the quarter and we're hearing more and more about. Can you just talk about sort of the latest and what you're thinking about potential divestitures? Are you willing to put a new number out there now that the finishing business is officially gone? I mean, a percent of assets at this point that you think you would potentially divest or are looking at for divestiture?","David B. Speer","Jamie, let me let Ron answer the beginning of your question, and I'll take the latter part.","Ronald D. Kropp","So the question on margins, incremental margins. So as you saw, we've taken down the overall revenue guidance a bit, but we've taken the overall earnings up in -- from a base business performance perspective, it's adding $0.03 per share. So we are getting some incremental margin benefit from the core businesses. The incrementals in the first quarter for the base businesses were 53%. So we had a very strong margin performance quarter from our base businesses. We expect to see very strong incrementals continue throughout the year. Overall, for the year, probably in the -- close to 40% for the full year in base business incremental. So that's certainly helpful. Offsetting that is obviously the increased restructuring. We've bumped that up a little bit, which took $0.03 out of the guidance.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just because I think last time, you were guiding more to like a 35% incremental versus the 40% on the base business, what's changed it? Is it the price feeling more comfortable with the price cost? Is it mix with more North America? I just want to make sure I understand the puts and takes.","Ronald D. Kropp","It's probably a little bit of price cost, but it's really just better performance. Better efficiencies, better cost reduction benefits, et cetera.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, I'm sorry, the last question, just on divestitures?","David B. Speer","Yes, on portfolio management, Jamie, what I would say is that as we've said over the last probably 1.5 to 2 years now, we're taking a lot more aggressive look at our own portfolio of businesses and being more proactive in looking at things that we consider to be core or non-core pieces long term. And as you pointed out, the finishing businesses that we sold to Graco in the first quarter -- or I should say in early April, were an indication of a set of businesses that we consider no longer core. And so we move forward to find the appropriate divestiture strategy for those. There are other businesses like that, that is part of our proactive portfolio management we'll consider. And undoubtedly, there'll be more activity. But at this stage, I wouldn't want to be in a position to quantify it because we're not far enough along to be able to talk about those things publicly. But we have an active program under way, and you can expect that there'll be other divestitures, as you'll see, come forward over the coming months and year.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I ask the question slightly differently then, relative to -- when we were talking about this, perhaps at the Analyst Day in December or even 6 months ago, is the amount of businesses potentially up for divestiture larger, while you don't want to put a percentage up? Or is it about the same?","David B. Speer","Well, if you look at the pattern here, I mean, the divestiture of the finishing business was truly a larger divestiture than the ones we had done prior. So there's no size range that was off limits, if you will. And I would say that based on what we've been looking at, the size range is probably somewhat larger than what we had seen in the past. In the past, if you go back, I think the time period from '06 to 2010, the average divestiture was more in the $50 million to $60 million range. And clearly, this was a $375 million divestiture. So I would say that the size of a potential divestiture will likely be somewhat larger going forward than what our past track record has been.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bank of America. First, on Construction. Now, I think, John Brooklier, you called out a softer construction Australia, New Zealand? Didn't that part of the world have some weather issues, though?","John L. Brooklier","Yes, there's been some weather issues, but we think it's a little bit more economically sensitive than that. And if you really look at what's going on in Australia, the economy is slowing. Some of the mineral-related exporting going on to China slowed a little bit as China slowed a little bit. So I would say the service side of the economy in Eastern Australia is certainly a lot slower, as is the Western side, where it's really more natural resources. That has slowed a bit, too. Overall, that's added up to a slower economy, which has impacted their housing market. I think housing -- it's probably one of the big key areas for them right now. That's somewhat way different.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So then if we back up of the Construction lens, if you will, and look at North America, you obviously, when you gave us the results right in the first quarter, how did that play out as the quarter progressed? And the question really comes down to, did you see or do you think you saw a bit of a pull forward because of the warm winter that we had, say, into December, January, February and -- I mean, the obvious question is was March much softer? Or has the trend still been pretty consistent?","David B. Speer","I think, John, what we've seen -- I mean, there's no question, the warm months of January through March pull some things forward. And I don't think it's going to change the trajectory of housing starts for the year. I think it gives a temporary sort of blip forward. The overall underlying dynamics still remain, with the inventory levels and housing prices the way they are. So while I think we saw some nice short-term momentum, I don't think that's something we expect to see sustained. There are some markets where the residential builds will begin to actually go up because of the local market conditions. Lack of available inventory or price points have actually started to rise. But I think it's still -- 2012, I think, is still a year to sort out for housing starts overall. But if you look at the overall numbers, we're expecting housing starts for the year to be closer to 700,000, which would be about a gain for the year in the mid-teens in housing starts. So it would be a nice welcome view to see that kind of a turn. But I wouldn't view the first quarter as a first data point that we could draw a line from and expect that rise to continue.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. No, that makes sense. I think -- well, if your mid-teens growth rate holds, right, I think you did up 7% in resi in North America. That should actually get better as the year then progresses?","David B. Speer","Correct.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last question on the simplification scaling up. You did, David, raise your guidance. You didn't just tighten the low end of the range. I'd always sort of been under the impression these initiatives were perhaps going to require a little bit of cost on ITW's part to -- for what -- for a variety of different potential things. Is that true? And is that in your numbers? Or is that -- a lot of this is still kind of in the fact-finding stage, and the more cost saves coupled with the cost spending or so forth is really about '13 versus '12.","David B. Speer","Well, I would say, John, it's both. But primarily, the costs that would be associated with some of these larger initiatives have not been fully represented in the guidance, because we don't have all the data yet. Some of it is represented in some of the restructuring that we've obviously put forward, which is higher than what we originally anticipated. But I think the best way to look at this is that we're still gathering the data, and there will be some investment involved in achieving some of what we think will be some significant savings along the way. And I expect that towards the latter part of the year, we'll have enough data to be comfortable giving some reasonable direction as to the size and significance of what we think will be happening. But it's a longer term sort of a process. So we're talking about things that would happen in 2013 largely and beyond with, I think, some reasonable quantification towards the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ann Duignan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Ann Duignan, JPMorgan. Just on the back of John's question. When I look at initiatives like strategic sourcing, I can't help but think that down the road, the consulting firm comes back and says, \"Gee, now you need an ERP system. You need people analyzing data.\" How do you balance, David, investing in some of these initiatives in the near term versus kind of SG&A creep and centralization over the long term?","David B. Speer","Well, I think it's like any major initiative. You evaluate what you think the benefits are and, obviously, benefits of significance across the enterprise will require some level of investment and talent and resource. But we'll have to balance that in terms of what we think makes sense, where we think the biggest payoffs are and the ones that we think will drive the greatest benefits in the organization. So as we assess those, we have to determine what investments will be required to achieve what we think will be reasonable and significant savings. So hard to answer the question till we have more data. But clearly, we'll be in a position to be making more investment around that. And from a centralization standpoint, there's no question. We'll want to do more coordination around some of these larger areas of spend where we can be certain that we're taking advantage of our scale opportunities in a much more formal way than we'd done in the past.","Ronald D. Kropp","And I will add that, yes, we are -- we do feel the decentralized business model is the right model for us, and we're not changing that because of strategic sourcing. So the focus of the study has been how do we do a better job of approaching sourcing throughout the company in our decentralized operating model?","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So we shouldn't be concerned that down the road you'd be building a new corporate headquarters somewhere?","Ronald D. Kropp","You've seen our old one, Ann.","David B. Speer","We might paint the existing one.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's one of the things we love about you, so we don't want to -- that to change. But just on -- building on that a little bit, I know you said that you will communicate the cost and the benefits of all of these changes late in 2012. Can you just talk about -- I mean, that's a year of data analysis. Can you just talk about why it will take you till late 2012 to assess the opportunities and the costs?","David B. Speer","Well, because, I think, first of all, if we're going to give you any indications with numbers, you're going to want those numbers to be reasonably solid. And those numbers are going to involve, as you accurately pointed out in the beginning of your questions, some investment in both people and systems, and so we want to be certain that before we started signaling what we think some of the potential savings are here that we're pretty solid on what the approach is going to be and the time frame associated with that. So I don't think we're -- I don't think we're trying to hedge our bets. What we're trying to do is be thoughtful about what we communicate and what we think is realistic. And I think for us to digest that is going to take that kind of time.","Ronald D. Kropp","And also, as David said, these are multi-year, long-term initiatives. So as we figure out how to approach these major initiatives within the company, we want to make sure we do it the right way and make sure we -- at the same time we're doing all of this, continue to deliver on our results that you'd expect.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Well, I wish you guys luck, because I know it's kind of a cultural change. So we'll check in at the end of the year, I guess.","David B. Speer","Well, it is somewhat of a cultural change. But, Ann, as you know, you followed us a long time, we've been through several cultural nuance changes that have been successful, and I'm quite confident that we will be with this as well.","Operator","Our next question will come from Deane Dray.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Deane Dray with Citi. David, I'd be interested in hearing more about your thoughts. We've discussed what are you thinking residential plays up, but how about the non-res cycle? Just in terms of the indicators that you think are important to ITW? What kind of visibility and how you think it plays out the balance of the year?","David B. Speer","You're talking about non-res here in the U.S.?","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, first.","David B. Speer","Well, the data certainly from a start standpoint for commercial has finally begun to show some improvement numbers. Year-to-date, the commercial construction square footage boards is up 7%, with some notable categories, up that have been down for a while. Retail is up 28%; warehouses are up 20% -- 80%. So I think we're beginning to see the turn. However, it is still regional. There are some markets where we still have a lot of overbuilt and vacant space. The 2 big exceptions to improvement in commercial remain offices and education. So I'm of a view that we've begun to turn the corner, but I don't think we're going to see a breakout in commercial construction until probably sometime in 2013. But it would appear, based on the data, the numbers and the activity in some of the major markets, that we're quite close.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then how about outside the U.S.?","David B. Speer","Sorry?","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Outside the U.S.?","David B. Speer","Outside the U.S.? Well, that's a mixed bag. Europe, reasonable numbers in the north of Europe, in Germany and in France. A lot of the European commercial construction, as you know, still has government financing tied to it. So some of this is going to play out based on what happens with their budgets and how they view deficit spending. But Europe for us in the first quarter proved to be fairly good in commercial. So hard to get a long-term read based on what's going to happen with their budgets longer term. Clearly, the south of Europe is going to be troubled for some time. Spain and Italy and the public spending there around construction, that's going to be troubling for some time to come. The Asian construction numbers remain reasonable, and I think we'll continue to see some boost there, more around commercial than around residential.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just on -- a business update on welding and -- we're back into some eye-popping numbers there. How much of that is true end-market demand? Or might there be some restocking going on?","David B. Speer","Well, there's probably some restocking going on. But frankly, the end-market demand in heavy equipment and the energy-related sectors, oil and gas, has been robust. And I mean, I can tell you that in some of our channels, particularly in North America, there's not a lot of stock in the channel. So it really is -- these are markets that are performing well and have what looks like a reasonable runway, at least for the next couple of quarters. The oil and gas, the energy-related infrastructure, will probably be longer than that. So I think we're still pretty -- we were obviously surprised by the strength overall of what we saw in Q1. But if you go back and look at Q3 and Q4 of last year, we were also surprised by the strength there. So I think these trends are trends that have some reasonably good legs to them for at least the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question will come from Henry Kirn.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's UBS. Sorry to beat the initiative horse again, but what drove the decision to go forward today? What's different now versus 5 years ago or 2 years ago?","David B. Speer","Well, let's see. What's different now than 5 years ago, about $5 billion of acquisitions and a whole host of businesses that had really not participated in some of these larger-scale opportunities to see what kind of benefits might be available. It had been probably 8 to possibly 10 years since we had done something similar on a sourcing level. And most of that had been around 3 or 4 significant raw material categories. And as we begin to look across the total spend, it became apparent that there was more out there than just what we had looked at in the past, and that the size and scale of the company had changed enough that this really required a fresh look. I mean, an $18 billion company looking at this as opposed to an $11 billion company, I mean, obviously, there's some significantly different scale opportunities. So we thought it was time for a fresh look.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's helpful. And then on electronics, how much did the destocking hurt the segment results? And how much more is left on destocking?","David B. Speer","Oh, that's a hard one because a lot of the electronics is related to consumer products, and it's hard to get a read on how much of it is channel destocking. But certainly a significant portion of that has been. This has been a volatile market for some time, up and down. I mean, we were talking about that as being a tough market for us in 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, we were comping things that were above 50%. So, hard to say with that market. It is, clearly, a volatile market and -- we're talking about cell phones, PDAs, computers, so you've got a mix of different products. Flat-screen TVS. I mean, you've got a lot of different consumer products in there with different demand cycles right now. So we expect that that's going to still be volatile for a while.","John L. Brooklier","Henry, I think we believe that the larger level of destocking took place in Q4 or later last year. And there was some element of destocking into Q1. But again, to David's point, it's very hard to get precision around those numbers. But I think on a -- conceptually, we think more of the destocking has probably taken place.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andy Casey.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions, a lot has been covered. What was the end-of-quarter share count?","Ronald D. Kropp","I'm not sure I have that handy.","David B. Speer","40-something. 40...","Ronald D. Kropp","45, I think, is what comes to mind. But we can follow up with you later on that number.","John L. Brooklier","We'll look at that number for you, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then I guess I'm searching for a little bit more granularity on the international construction markets. Was there any heartbeat as the quarter progressed in those markets, Europe and Australia specifically?","David B. Speer","Well, Europe performed actually reasonably well. But as I said earlier, it's a tale of 2 stories, the northern part of Europe versus the southern. I think the one that was the weakest, that probably told the story for us, was Australia. And I think John talked about that earlier, some of the economic issues there, the housing market has slowed significantly. The economy there is slowing significantly. And they have some currency translation issues down there as well as they're buying a lot of their imported goods in U.S. dollars. So that's probably the one that -- Australia is probably the one that caught us with the biggest surprise. And in the retail segment down there where we have reasonable presence, this is where we expect to see some pretty good retail activity. And that just hasn't picked up at this stage.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just one last one, a question on the strategy. When other companies have talked about starting transformations, strategic pricing is typically discussed. I wouldn't imagine that you're a multiple-of-cost-type business, but is that part of what you're investigating? Or is it all strategic sourcing?","David B. Speer","Let me understand the question. Strategic pricing versus?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No. When you go after the strategic sourcing and try to leverage what you have, just steps that are taken to make sure that you don't have any price leakage?","David B. Speer","Oh, yes. That is definitely part of what we're talking about, yes. And that is linked to some of the work that we're doing on the commercial side that we're able to bring back together on the sourcing side. So yes, I would expect that we're going to see some changes coming out of that as well. As you know, we have a number of global platforms where we already do a fair amount of strategic pricing across the platforms. Automotive is certainly an example of that, as is appliance, and certainly across some of our welding markets as well. But yes, that's clearly something that has opportunity with it.","Ronald D. Kropp","And also, a benefit of the business simplification initiative, when we have scaled up businesses that are larger, we have a better opportunity for coordinated pricing across bigger businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ajay Kejriwal.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Ajay, FBR Capital Markets. Thanks for providing the color on longer-term initiatives. And maybe just to follow up on the scale up of businesses, could you maybe talk about what that could mean in terms of combining businesses? I thought I heard $100 million average revenues. Does that mean the number of subsidiaries get cut in half? Is that something that could happen over the next couple of years?","David B. Speer","Clearly, it means that the number of business units will be fewer. And as I said in my comments in the beginning, the ones that would be consolidated are largely ones where they have similar customers, markets and products already. But it would -- yes, it would result in fewer business units and, obviously, better operating efficiencies inside those business units and lower overhead costs. So, hard to predict exactly how many business units, how many fewer business units, but it would be a significant number. If you look at the average business units that we had in average business unit size that we had in 2010, it would have been closer to $30 million. So if you just take that math and look at a $100 million, it would suggest perhaps 2\/3 less business units. And we're not far enough along to predict that because we're not doing it just as a math exercise, but there will be a significant reduction in individual business units as we've called them. And a lot of those services and approaches will be consolidated under one umbrella in those cases.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Good, that's helpful. And then on strategic sourcing, I thought you mentioned steel, resin, chemicals, a couple other items. Maybe if you can talk about the total buy or the spend that you're looking to target? And any sense on the size of the opportunity there? I know it's very, very early, but...","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. I think, certainly, as we've said, when we raise a -- start getting into some specifics around numbers and benefits towards the end of the year, that will be part of what we talk about. Not ready to get into that at this point.","David B. Speer","But as you can imagine, I mean, the size is significant in terms of the spend in these categories. But as Ron says, until we've got better data, we really don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and communicate data here that is premature. But it's -- these numbers are big, obviously.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And you're looking at the total spend across these broad categories you've mentioned?","David B. Speer","Yes. We're looking at total spend.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nigel Coe.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to kind of dig into what you're just talking about. Taking down the number of business units by, let say, 2\/3, can you just maybe remind us what level of G&A overhead you have in each of these operating companies, be it finance, HR, et cetera? And then maybe if you could then talk about, as you go through this process, where you see the opportunities in terms of gross margin versus SG&A overhead?","Ronald D. Kropp","On the first question, the typical business unit is run as a stand-alone business, which means it has a general manager, a controller, typically HR support, and any -- the other functional disciplines you would need to run a business. They typically would have a stand-alone system, although, in some cases, we do have business units that shares systems across multiple business units, especially when they're located in the same general area. So that's the kind of the SG&A profile of a business. We have generally been pretty efficient at running, so these are pretty lean overhead structures. If you look at our overall overhead levels versus our peers, we certainly compare favorably. But as we scale up, there certainly will be some opportunities to leverage some of these overhead functions across a bigger business unit and, therefore, result in some cost reductions.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. I mean, I look at your SG&A as a portion of sales, it's about 18% or thereabouts. It's pretty -- compares very favorably to your peers. But I'm wondering, as you drive joint procurements, do you think it's more of an opportunity on procurement versus G&A? Or do you think the 2 are pretty even?","Ronald D. Kropp","Yes. Again, it's hard to say. I mean, I think there's big opportunities in both. And certainly, as we move through this and figure out how to approach this in detail, and we'll be ready to share that with you towards the end of the year.","David B. Speer","I think we'll clearly see significant opportunities in both.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's clear. And then just quickly on the -- coming back to the portfolio. I mean, I don't know. I mean -- that there are obviously some numbers out there in the market in terms of what you could do in terms of proportion of sales. But how do you feel about reallocating the capital? Because, let's say you've realized $3 billion to $4 billion of proceeds from this process, I mean, do you wish to replace that with more of an emphasis in acquisitions versus buybacks? Or is that to be decided?","Ronald D. Kropp","Well, certainly, to be decided, right? I mean, we haven't -- we don't have that kind of capital to put to use right now. And as -- if we did, we'd have to go through our capital allocation strategy and figure out how we utilize that. So we've, I think, clearly laid out our capital allocation priorities. In fact, we've got a slide in the deck today that lays that out. Organic investments is our first priority, then dividends, and then external investments. And external investments, share repurchase versus acquisitions, is really based on the specific opportunities at a point in time and which of those has the best risk-adjusted return. So, for instance, in the finishing sale, we have some proceeds from the finishing divestiture, we intend to use those to repurchase shares. That's one of the reasons that our share repurchase forecast went up for the year.","John L. Brooklier","I think we will end it there with that question and answer. We want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to speaking to you at some future point in time. Thank you very much.","Operator","At this time, that will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect, and thank you for your attendance."],"11509":["Illinois Tool Works Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2019 financials results and provide guidance for full year 2020.","Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for 2020, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","Finally, I would like to remind folks, we have our Investor Day coming up six weeks from today on March 13 in Fort Worth, Texas. We encourage you to join us or listen to the webcast for an update on our strategy and long range plans. The link to access the webcast is posted on our investor website.","Please turn to Slide 3. And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.","Scott Santi","Thank you, Karen, and good morning everyone.","The ITW team delivered another quarter of solid operational execution and strong financial performance in Q4. Despite some broad based macro challenges, we delivered GAAP EPS growth of 9%, operating margin of 23.7% and after-tax return on invested capital of 28.9% in the quarter. For the full year against the backdrop of an industrial demand environment that went from decelerating in the first half of the year to contracting in the second half of the year, we continued to execute well on the things within our control.","As a result, despite revenues that were down $700 million or 4.5% year-on-year, we delivered record GAAP EPS of $7.74 expanded operating margin to 24.4% excluding higher restructuring expenses, and grew free cash flow by 9%. In addition, we were able to raise our dividend by 7% and returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Equally important, in 2019, we continued to make solid progress on our path to ITW's full potential performance through the execution of our enterprise strategy. Last year, we invested more than $600 million to support the execution of our strategy and further enhanced the growth and profitability performance of our core businesses.","In addition, each of our divisions continued to make progress in executing well-defined and focused plans to achieve full potential performance in their respective businesses. We look forward to providing a full progress update on our enterprise strategy and our progress towards ITWs full potential performance at our Investor Day in March.","Looking ahead, ITW's powerful and proprietary business model, diversified high quality business portfolio and dedicated team of highly skilled ITW colleagues around the world position us well to continue to deliver a differentiated performance across a range of economic scenarios in 2020 and beyond.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with more detail on our Q4 and full year 2019 performance as well as our guidance for 2020. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thank you Scott, and good morning everyone.","In the fourth quarter, organic revenue declined 1.6% year-over-year in what remains a pretty challenging demand environment. The strike at GM reduced our enterprise organic growth rate by approximately 50 basis points and product line simplification was 60 basis points in the quarter.","By geography, North America was down 2% and international was down 1%. Europe declined 1% while Asia Pacific was flat. Organic growth in China was broad-based across our portfolio and up 7% year-over-year. As expected, our execution on the elements within our control remained strong in the fourth quarter. Operating margin was 23.7% including 40 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from higher restructuring expenses year-over-year.","Excluding those higher expenses, operating margin was up 10 basis points to 24.1%. Enterprise initiatives contributed 130 basis points and price cost was positive 30 basis points. GAAP EPS was up 9% to $1.99 and included $0.11 gain from three divestitures and $0.06 headwind from higher restructuring expenses year-over-year and foreign currency translation impact.","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8%. Free cash flow was 114% of net income and as planned we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter. Overall, Q4 was another quarter characterized by strong operational execution and resilient financial performance in a pretty challenging demand environment.","Let's move to Slide four and operating margin. Overall, operating margin of 23.7% was down 30 basis points year-over-year primarily due to higher restructuring expense. Excluding those higher restructuring expenses, margin improved 10 basis points despite a 3% decline in revenues.","Enterprise initiatives were once again the highlight and key driver of our margin performance contributing 130 basis points the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2017. The enterprise initiative impact continues to be broad based across all seven segments ranging from 80 to 200 basis points and the benefits of the restructuring activities that we initiated early in the year are being realized. The majority of these restructuring projects are supporting enterprise initiative implementation.","Specifically our 80\/20 front-to-back execution. Price remained solid with price well, ahead of raw material costs and price\/cost contributed 30 basis points in the quarter. Volume leverage was negative 30 basis points. In Q4 as we always do, we updated our inventory standards to reflect current raw material costs. As raw material costs in the aggregate have declined over the course of the year, the annual mark-to-market adjustment to the value of our inventory that we do every fourth quarter this year had an unfavorable impact of 30 basis points versus last year.","We also had a favorable item last year that didn't repeat this year for 40 basis points. And finally the other category which includes typical wage and salary inflation was 50 basis points, so overall solid margin performance again for the quarter and the year.","Turning to Slide 5 for details on segment performance. As you know, 2019 was challenging from an industrial demand standpoint and you can see that the organic growth rate in every one of our segments -- seven segments was lower in 2019 than in 2018. At the enterprise level, the organic growth rates swung from positive 2% in 2018 to down 2% in 2019 with the biggest year on year swings in our CapEx related equipment offerings and automotive.","Speaking of automotive, let's move to the individual segments results starting with automotive OEM. Organic revenue was down 5% as the GM strike reduced revenues by approximately two percentage points. Taking a closer look at regional performance. North America was in line with D3 builds down 13% Europe was essentially flat versus builds that were down 6% and China organic growth was 11% compared to builds up 1. Continued significant output in China reflects increasing penetration, particularly with local OEMs.","Moving on to Slide 6, food equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2% year-over-year despite a tough comp of 5% organic growth last year. The service business was solid up 4% in the quarter. Equipment growth of 1% reflects double-digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants against tough year-over-year comps for both of those. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor.","Test and measurement in electronics had a very strong quarter with test and measurement up 6% with 13% growth in our Instron business. The segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers. Electronics was up 2%. Margin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margins 330 basis points to a record, 28.1% the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. Also in the quarter, we divested in electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million.","Turning to Slide 7, welding organic revenue declined 4% against a tough comparison of 8% growth last year. North America equipment was down to 3% against a tough comparison of up 7% last year. The lower demand is primarily in the industrial business. While commercial, which includes smaller business and personal users, was pretty stable.","Oil and gas was down 2%, operating margin was 25.4% down 150 basis points primarily due to higher restructuring expenses. In the quarter, we divested an installation business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million which reduced weldings organic -- with overall growth rate by 250 basis points in the quarter.","Polymers & Fluids organic growth was down 2% versus a tough comp of plus 4% last year. Polymers was flat, automotive aftermarket was down 1%, fluids was down 6%. Operating margin was strong up 150 basis points driven primarily by enterprise initiatives.","Moving to Slide 8, construction organic revenue was down 1% with continued softness in Australia and New Zealand, which was down 4%. Europe was down 3%, but the U.K. down 14%, North America was up 2% with residential remodel up 2% and commercial up 5%. Operating margin was 22.2% down due to the inventory mark-to-market adjustments and higher restructuring expenses.","In specialty, organic revenue was down 3% which on a positive note is an improvement from the past couple of quarters. As in prior quarters, the main drivers are significant PLS and the relative performance of the businesses we have identified as potential divestitures. Excluding these potential divestitures, core organic growth was down 1.7%. By geography, North America was on 4 and international 3. We also divested a business in this segment with 2019 revenues of approximately $15 million and these divestitures reduced specialties of growth rate by almost 8 percentage point.","Now let's quickly review full year 2019 on Slide 9, and in a challenging industrial demand environment, organic revenue was down 1.9% with total revenues down 4.5% as foreign currency translation impact reduced revenues by 2.3% and divestitures by 30 basis points. GAAP EPS was 7.74 and included $0.09 of divestiture gains as well as $0.32 of headwinds from foreign currency and higher restructuring expenses year-over-year.","Operating margin was 24.1%, 24.4% excluding higher year-on-year restructuring expense as enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points, after tax return on invested capital improved 50 basis points to 28.7%. Our cash performance was very strong with free cash flow up 9% and a conversion rate of 106% of net income.","We made significant internal investments to grow and support our highly profitable businesses, increased our annual dividend by 7% and utilized our share repurchase program to return surplus capital to our shareholders.","A quick update on our various divestiture processes that overall remain on track. As a reminder, we're looking to potentially divest certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion and are targeted to complete the effort by year end 2020. The strategic objective with this phase of our portfolio management effort is to improve our overall organic growth rate by 50 basis points and improve margins by approximately 100 basis points. Not counting potential gains on sales, the plan is to offset any EPS dilution with incremental share repurchases.","In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of 3 businesses with combined 2019 revenues of approximately $135 million generating a pre-tax gain on sale of $50 million or $0.11 a share. In 2019, these businesses were a 20 basis points drag to our organic growth rate and 10 basis points to our margin rate.","In summary, a challenging demand environment -- in a challenging demand environment, the ITW team executed well and delivered strong financial results, made solid progress on our enterprise strategy and agenda, including our organic growth initiatives and positioned the company for differentiated performance in 2020 and beyond.","On Slide 10, we wanted to give you a quick update on the progress that we're making on our organic growth initiatives. We estimated the aggregate market growth rate or decline for each one of our segments and compared it to the segments actual organic growth rate in 2019. We also included the product line simplification by segment. As you know, full potential steady state PLS is expected to be about 30 basis points.","As you can see overall, we've made some good progress as our segments are all outgrowing their underlying markets except for specialty products. At the enterprise level, we estimate that we outpaced our aggregate blended market growth rates by approximately 1 percentage points. So overall good progress on our organic growth initiatives and by completing our Finish the Job agenda over the next several years, we expect to generate one or two percentage points of additional improvement in ITW's organic growth rate. As Scott mentioned, we look forward to providing a full progress update at our Investor day in March.","Now let's talk -- let's turn the page and talk about 2020 and starting with Slide 11. First, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $7.65 to $8.05 for 2020. Using current levels of demand, adjusted for seasonality. Organic growth at the enterprise level is forecast to be in the range of 0% to 2% for the year. At current exchange rates, foreign currency translation impact and the revenue associated with our 2019 divestitures each of 1 percentage point headwind to revenue.","PLS impact is expected to be approximately 50 basis points. We expect to expand operating margin from 24.1% in 2019 to a range of 24.5% to 25% in 2020 with enterprise initiatives contributing approximately a 100 basis points. After tax ROIC should improve to a range of 29% to 30% and as usual, we expect strong free cash flow with conversion greater than net income.","We have allocated $2 billion to share repurchases with core share repurchases of $1.5 billion and additional $500 million to offset the EPS dilution from the three completed divestitures. Additional items include an expected tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24.5% which represents a $0.10 EPS headwind and foreign currency at today's rates is also unfavorable $0.10 EPS.","Just a quick word as it relates to the Coronavirus situation in China and we are obviously in the same position as everyone else. At this point, we've baked into our guidance a last week of production, assuming that we all return to work in China on February 10th. But obviously, it's too early to tell and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely.","Overall, ITW is well positioned for a differentiated financial performance across a wide range of scenarios as we continue to execute on the things within our control and make meaningful progress on our path to full potential performance through the implementation of our Finish the Job enterprise strategy agenda.","Finally, we're providing an organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2020 on Slide 12. And as always, these are based on current run rates, adjusted for seasonality and are obviously influenced by year-over-year comparisons as we go through the year. It's important to note that there's no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance.","You can see that every segment is forecasted to improve the organic growth rate in 2020 relative to 2019. The same is true for margins as every segments expects to improve their margin performance in 2020.","With that Karen, I'll turn it back to you.","Karen Fletcher","All right. Thanks Michael. Julianne, we are ready to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys. Scott and Mike, you had a big pickup at Instron in the quarter and in Food Equipment, which are CapEx businesses that you've tended to watch over the year, so while recognizing all the uncertainty that's out there now, because of the virus, may be still some trade uncertainty, did you actually see some movement in CapEx decisions from your customers and what does it tell you about 2020?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think Q4 certainly the growth rates in those businesses were better than what we saw in Q3. Part of that was a number of orders in Q3 that were deferred into Q4. And so I think it's -- in our view, it's a little too early to talk about a pickup in demand here in those businesses. Certainly encouraging, but a little too early to tell Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I look at your enterprise strategy program, your margin benefit seems to be accelerating here. As these programs get mature, you would think that maybe they'd level off or decelerate. So I know you have your Analyst Day coming up, you'll talk about this, maybe just continuing to get better on 80\/20 as you evolve in enterprise strategy, is that, really what this is and do you expect your [indiscernible] enterprise strategy to be at least a 100 basis points, through that target date of 2023?","Michael Larsen","Well, I mean, let's take one year at a time here. I think the fact that we are eight years into this current enterprise strategy and still generating, 100 basis points of margin expansion in 2020 is certainly encouraging. We've talked about before why that is, 80\/20 today is significantly more powerful than when we began this journey. We've continued to learn and gotten better from an execution standpoint. The raw materials that we're working with in terms of the quality of the businesses are significantly higher after all the work we've done in the portfolio.","And so I think we're really encouraged by the continued progress. We're highly confident that we will reach our 2023 performance goals. 80, 20 will be a big -- continue to be a big part of that, but it's a little too early to tell what those contributions might be in 2021 and 2022, but you can rest assure that we are highly confident in achieving those margin objectives we've put out there.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks Mike. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Good to see that the divestiture activity picking up. Is it just that, some things kind of fell in place or do you expect actually the pace to be accelerated here? And can you remind us how many individual businesses are lefts, so these are all kind of one-at-a-time transactions, I would take it.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So I think this is -- the cadence here was in line with the process that we've laid out. We've got a number of businesses. So three divestitures completed. I think when we filed a 10-K, you'll see that there are another three at this point that are in that held for sale category. And then there will be a number of businesses beyond that. So, we're making good progress in a little bit more challenging macro than what we had expected maybe going into this, but the most important\u2026","Jeff Sprague","Which has slowed the process down a bit.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think, I was going to say, it's probably slowed things down maybe a little bit. I think the really important thing is we are -- we're still on track to achieve the 50 basis points of structural improvement in our organic growth rate and a 100 basis points of margin improvement, current expectations, we're targeting to get those done by the end of 2020, and we certainly have a shot at that, but as Scott said, I mean, just given the macro backdrop that might get pushed out a little bit. But overall these processes are on track.","Jeff Sprague","Well, on the flip side of that, obviously you've been hunting for deals given that you're kind of a cash rich strategic buyer, do you see things kind of getting easier? Is the pipeline filling up? Like what would you really expect to happen here in 2020 on the acquisition side?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think we have certainly been more active from the standpoint and we've talked about it before in terms of our willingness to consider adding to the portfolio, the right kind of assets. And we're certainly I had -- let's just call it maxed up by our activity in that regard in 2019. As it is obvious, we didn't hit on anything yet in that regard. And it's a combination always of sort of the fit in terms of strategy and also sort of the valuation environment. And I would say the overall color in 2019 is that we looked at some things that we're interested strategically that from a valuation standpoint didn't hit the screen, didn't meet the criteria, and we will continue to be active in assessing opportunities to add to our portfolios as we've talked about in the past, but we're going to remain a very disciplined posture in that regard. And I have no doubt that we will very successfully add to our portfolio as we go.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Good morning everyone. Just a quick question on the margin guidance. Have you factored in any restructuring at this point?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So the -- at this point Mig, we are guiding to margins for 2020 in that 24.5% to 25% range which includes restructuring. So on a year-over-year basis at this point we are assuming that restructuring will be flat and obviously we'll see how the year plays out and adjusts accordingly.","Mig Dobre","Flat in dollar terms or in terms of margin drag?","Michael Larsen","Flat in dollar terms and margin drag and therefore EPS neutral.","Mig Dobre","Okay. Then my follow up, I'm just trying to kind of wrap my mind on the buckets here. So, if I'm looking at the low end of your guidance the 24.5, I'm presuming that that's consistent with the low end of the revenue guidance or the volume that you're providing. And I'm comparing it to sort of what you've done in the prior year. Can you maybe help me with a bit of a bridge here? Obviously you've got the enterprise initiatives were a 100 basis points that helped, but there's some other items to price cost, maybe some other things that you are doing how do we get to the high-end and the low-end here?","Michael Larsen","So Mig, are you talking EPS or margins. What would you like to do?","Mig Dobre","Just margin, not EPS, just margin.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So I think for 2020, we provided quite of bit information already. And maybe one way to think about it is, the initiatives contribute a 100 basis points. We have positive volume leverage baked into our guidance. You can look at historically based on Europe organic growth rate, what the impact might be there. Price cost, we're assuming neutral at this point, maybe slightly positive and we'll see how that plays out. The divestitures that we completed in '19, that is a little bit of a favoribility to margins. And then, I'd say the remainder here is, we're going to continue to invest to support our organic growth initiatives. We're going to invest in our people and we're going to invest to sustain our core businesses as we always have. And so if you kind of look at the remaining buckets, 2020, maybe expect it to be similar to what we had in 2019.","Mig Dobre","Got it. That's helpful. And lastly, if I may, as you look at your segments into 2020, are there one or two that stand out to you as having more margin potential than margin expansion potential than average? Thanks.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think, Mig, this is really across the board as I think I said in my comments, we expect every one of our segments based on our bottoms up planning process, based on what they have told us really at the divisional level on up, we expect every segment to continue to make progress in 2020 over 2019.","Scott Santi","And I'd say that the other delta is, is what you talked about before, which is the volume leverage component, right? The more growth we get, the more increase in the margin we're going to get.","Michael Larsen","Yes. And I think you saw a good example of that. This quarter if you look at just the performance in test and measurement margins up, 330 basis points, two-thirds of that was the volume leverage and the enterprise initiatives. So, you can see what happens in these businesses when we get a little bit of volume, a little bit of organic growth coming through. So\u2026","Mig Dobre","All right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning. Just looking at your segment, organic growth forecast, could you just walk us through the various segments and where you see the upside versus the downside risks?","Michael Larsen","Well, I'd say these are all, first of all based on kind of current run rates. And so, I think there are a couple of segments here that have a slightly wider range automotive OEM, welding, which reflects maybe a little more market uncertainty in those. I think Food Equipment has a measurement those look pretty solid, Food Equipment in that two to four range, Test and Measurement one to three. And then, you can see the rest here, Polymers and Fluids, Construction, Specialty kind of in that low-single-digit at the mid point. So that's kind of -- I think how we characterize it. I mean, as you know Ann, this is a pretty uncertain environment, right? I mean this is -- 2019 is a challenging year. 2020, we've got to -- we have to see how this China situation plays out that we just talked about. And so as we sit here today, this is kind of our current forecast using the current levels of demand that we're seeing in these businesses.","Ann Duignan","Yes. And in that context, I mean, you're much closer to these businesses than we are obviously, but then Polymers and Fluids, I think of that business as being more consumer driven. And so, can you just talk about all of the guidance for on the downside, the negative one?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think -- so Polymers and Fluids, about half of the business is -- when you say consumer-driven you're pointing I think to the automotive aftermarket business. If you just look at kind of where retail numbers are in that space, they're probably down slightly. We've had some challenges this year on the MRO side.","Scott Santi","Which is more B2B.","Michael Larsen","More B2B, the fluids business on the MRO side, particularly in Europe. And then, you also have a couple of other end markets that are not exactly very favorable at this point, including some petrochemical exposure. There is some marine exposure and so overall, we'd say Polymers and Fluids flat in 2019 and slightly positive here in 2020.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate the color and then I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Michael Larsen","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning. A little bit of a clarification on the margin walk, you called out several things, inventory restructuring, non-repeat of an item. Would those in the past typically be included in other?","Michael Larsen","Yes, that is correct. Okay. So the inventory adjustment, sorry, I need to interrupt you, but the inventory adjustment, it's one that we make every year. And it's just that this year, because raw material costs have come down throughout the year that adjustments is a little bit larger than prior years as we mark-to-market the inventory. And so we decided to call it out as a separate item and kind of give you the transparency, the detail around that.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you. And then a few questions on the divestitures, on your earlier comment about the slower pace than expected due to the macro. Is that purely timing or are you encountering hesitancy from potential buyers of the assets because of the overall uncertainty? And then, for the three and the four sale category, you mentioned in the K, are they excluded from 2020 top-line guidance and what was their impact on 2019 margin performance?","Michael Larsen","Yes. So those -- but let me start with that one. So the ones that you'll see that are held for sale, we are assuming in our guidance that we are going to own those in 2020. So 2020 numbers exclude any further divestitures as well as any acquisitions. So this is really -- think of it as all in as we the businesses that we own today.","I think on your first question, I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think some of these, it's an element of timing. And I also think the\u2026","Scott Santi","The process is taking longer.","Michael Larsen","Process is taking a little bit more longer, maybe that has to do with the desire to do maybe more due diligence. And then, I think the other piece is, the macro backdrop, there is some uncertainty and so I think we've seen some of both of those, but -- and then I'll just say finally, I mean we're going to be disciplined as we divest these businesses. And if this is not, if this isn't the right time to do it from an evaluation standpoint, we might defer some of these processes into next year. So, we'll keep you posted as we go through the year and get on these earnings calls. And we'll get you an update on the processes.","Scott Santi","I'm just going to add. These are all high-quality businesses certainly on a relative basis. They are not businesses that we think are the right fit for us long term, but these are not distressed businesses by any stretch. So these are quality assets that have certainly a lot of appeal. And as Michael said to the extent that the macro environment creates a situation where we don't think we're able to trade at fair value, then we're going wait to cycle out and we'll get there eventually. But we've been able to do three so far. We've got another -- all the three versions.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks. Just as a follow-up on that, the three that are mentioned in the K. Should we expect those to have a similar type margin performance to the three that you have already been able to sell?","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think they're all pretty similar. I mean, there's a range. The average maybe it's the way to think about it is in that high-single digits EBIT percentage. So that's one way to think about it.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Larsen","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you. I was just wondering like, clearly, we are in a very choppy and challenging demand environment, but and you guys are continuing to expand margins even with that. But how do we -- how is the company thinking about the 3% to 5% organic objectives and at some point it's become counter productive to even be shooting for that in this type of environment. And can you remind us, where do you get to in your margins over the long-term in just sort of a flattish environment like we're in right now versus the plus three to five.","Scott Santi","I think from the standpoint of our core growth rate objectives, what we are really saying essentially is that this is a business that should out grow the underlying growth rates that the markets we're in from -- anywhere from say 2% to 4% on an average basis over time. We're in a situation right now where the market and our estimation of the blended market rate, these are -- sort of using our best assumptions was down 2.5 last year.","So, in a normal, let's call it a normal average GDP world of you pick whether it's two or three on a long-term basis and that's where the three to five essentially comes from in terms of the overall expectations that we have for this company. And there's nothing in this, call it industrial recessionary environment that would in any way change the view of what we think our long-term potential is. This is a highly differentiated portfolio.","We've talked before and again, we'll get into a lot more depth on this at the Investor Day, but we've got the ability to generate at least the point of incremental growth from innovation. And other point from penetration is the simple math. That's the bottom-line standard that we're working to position ourselves to execute consistently on. And we've got a lot of businesses that are already there and then some.","So, the last thing we'd want to do is take a point in time set of market conditions and ultimately get us off of our long-term view of what we think the potential of this company is. I think from a margin standpoint, we've got -- I'll let Michael jump in here, but we've got a set of performance objectives out into the future that we've laid out in the past that we expect to continue to make progress again.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think nothing has changed in terms of our view on the margin target as I said earlier. I mean, Ross, it might be helpful, the three to five, we know that we're not going to grow three to five every year. This is over a five-year period, we'd expect kind of in a normal macro that's the performance that we should be able to deliver. And with that comes to margins in that 28% range and EPS growth in the low double-digit, everything that we've laid out for 2023. So our views on those haven't changed just given the macro that we're in today.","Ross Gilardi","No. Thanks guys. I realize you're still outgrowing your end markets. I wasn't trying to pick on you for that at all. I was just trying to -- with respect to your long-term margin target, really just to remind me how much of that getting there was coming from your ability to hit the three to five versus if we're just in a flattish environment for the next several years.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I mean, again, I think the biggest driver here remains the continued strong execution on the enterprise initiatives. And then, there's a reasonable assumption of some volume leverage that comes with that. And you saw that, like I said earlier, if you look at Test and Measurement is a great example this quarter, you got a little bit of volume leverage. We get a normal macro environment. We're going to get there very quickly. I think that's what we're trying to say here. And over any five-year period, we expect that we'll average in that three to five range, but if we get a couple of really good years and we'll get there faster than that.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Since you mentioned, you reminded us of the semiconductors and I realize you weren't factoring any pickup into your guide by just ITW is obviously a great barometer for capital spending in general in the global economy. Are you seeing any signs of CapEx picking up anywhere or percolating or, it feels like discussions are getting a little bit more optimistic in any of your businesses?","Michael Larsen","No. Not at this point. I think, Q4 was really more of the same. This remains a pretty challenging, a pretty challenging environment, so.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Got it. And then just the last thing I want to ask about is, you've seen a return of the outgrowth in your European and China auto businesses. China now for a couple of quarters are -- do you feel like you're back to the point where that is firmly kind of set to continue or does it feel kind of quarter-to-quarter at this point, just given the weakness in the end market?","Michael Larsen","China is very solid. I mean, I think we have a long track record. The team has a long track record of outgrowing the underlying market there by a wide margin. And as I think we said in the prepared remarks, big drivers are continued penetration with local OEMs and there is a lot of runway still. And if you just look at the projects that have been locked in for the next two to three years, we're confident that that outperformance will continue.","Scott Santi","Yes. I think on the question of Europe and North America, I think the issues now, we're sort of using a very gross number in terms of builds and the underlying issues are given the volatility OEM to OEM in those builds and what's going on in the quarter-to-quarter. It's kind of -- a bit of a choppy comparison. I think on a full year basis, it's a better way to look at our relative performance in Europe and North America. We will be in a position to provide an update on that for '19 at the Investor Day.","So some of the -- my only point is, we have a big pipeline of penetration projects in Europe and North America and fully expect on a sort of -- let's call it even a medium term, that we will outgrow those markets by a minimum of two to four points. But some of the last things that have gone on over the last six quarters, both from the standpoint of how different individual OEMs are reacting to some of the current environment and how the supply chains react to those OEMs reacting. There's some sort of real volatility that I think sort of mucks up some of the ability to see through the underlying progress. But we track our penetration on a per vehicle basis with each of the OEMs. And on that basis feel really good about our ability to continue to penetrate at a rate well above market all around the world.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","John Inch","Good morning everybody. Hi guys. Michael, just a quick clarification, the repo is going from 1.5 to 2, is that delta of 500 to offset the 1.35 of the divestitures you announced or\u2026","Michael Larsen","Yes. That's correct. So let me just spend a second on that. So kind of the -- our estimate for surplus capital for the year is 1.5 billion, but that's currently allocated to share repurchases. I think of those as kind of the core share repurchases. And then there's an incremental 500 million to offset the EPS or the earnings that went away with those three divestitures. And to the extent that there are -- hopefully there are further divestitures this year. We will adjust that share repurchase number accordingly. So we could end up at a number that's higher than what's on the page today.","John Inch","Got it. Michael, is overall demand growth presumably begins to come back once we get past some of these China issues in this year and you're spending probably dollars up a little bit consistent with what other companies might be doing. How are you feeling about your confidence level of maintaining or how should we think about, say, a 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives that actually came in the past when growth was better in the environment? Does it, is it one of those things where maybe the -- you get better improvement because of the contribution benefits from improved growth by EI, enterprise initiative benefits sort of bounce back a little bit because of the spending or, , how would you think of the mix of that? I suppose on an improving\u2026","Scott Santi","Yes. I'll sort of piggyback on part of what Michael said earlier, which is -- the enterprise initiative visibility that we have is really about one-year forward, so that those are discrete projects, certainly underneath a broader strategy that is largely around two things at this point, strategic sourcing and continued improvement in the quality of our practice of 80\/20 across the company.","And so what we're saying now is, we've got another point in front of us in 2020 that certainly I can say with confidence if that's not the end of it. But we will continue to have that as some additional sort of fuel to the profitability story here for a while.","The other thing, I can tell you is on sort of the incremental contribution from organic growth as it accelerates. The best way I can frame that as I don't see any way, we don't generate somewhere in the range of 30% to 35% incremental contribution from every dollar of organic growth over and above enterprise initiative.","John Inch","That's helpful. Yes, no, it definitely helps. But just lastly, Scott and Michael, what are your -- what would you say your top personal priorities are for ITW to accomplish? Maybe as we look back in a year on 2020, if there's a way to sort of frame that out?","Scott Santi","You asked to go individually. Michael is going to say he is going to upgrade the quality of the CEO. But I think we're on it. I think the biggest things that we've got to continue to do the thing we've been, it's certainly been the largest part of our focus for the last, I'd say two years now is really continued to accelerate our focus or not just our focus, but our execution on organic growth. And this kind of environment, it's certainly hard to see the underlying progress. But I can tell you that all of us get up every morning thinking about -- our Vice Chair, Chris O'Herlihy, Michael and I and everyone of our AVPs get up every morning thinking about what are we going to do today to help to continue to get this company towards our full potential from an organic growth rate standpoint.","I think the other activities around the enterprise initiatives are -- there's a lot of potential there. Those are certainly things that need some level of attention to continue the momentum for sure. But ultimately I feel really good about both the structural and strategic things we're doing from the standpoint of organic growth acceleration. And I don't think that changes in 2020 regardless of what the macro is doing at the moment. Michael to give you his answer.","Michael Larsen","Mine is exactly the same. I would just add, John, that at Investor Day, we obviously going to spend a lot of time on this topic of organic growth including, we'll give you a progress update if you would call on the number of divisions that are in that ready to grow and growing category defined as consistently growing above market. We're not going to -- and we'll share those numbers with you and you'll see we made steady progress in 2019. And we expect to -- as we execute on some really focused plans in 2020 to continue to make progress on that. So we'll share those metrics with you and we'll also give you some real divisional examples because that's really where this work is taking place. To give you kind of some insights to what Scott's talking about. The whole company is focused on getting the organic growth rate going and we'll give you a lot more detail on that when we get together in March.","John Inch","I mean, the way you talked about Instron last time was very helpful. So yes, very much looking forward to it. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. I think most of my questions been answered. Just clarification -- or I guess two questions. One, on the welding side, I appreciate, your guide, just wondering, how you think about your organic growth guide relative to sort of what we saw in the 15, 16 time period and why we shouldn't be concerned? What you're seeing in the market to give you confidence that it couldn't be worse than that?","And then my second question, just given all the restructuring that you guys have done and obviously done a great job improving your margins, but assuming the markets were weak or is there any change if your sales declined on how we should think about decrementals? Thanks.","Michael Larsen","Yes. I think on the restructuring, maybe I'll start with that. I think, we'll see how the year unfolds. And if market conditions deteriorate similar to what we did last year, we'll pull forward some of these enterprise initiative projects specifically related to our 80, 20 front to a back pipeline. I expect we will play at the same way in 2020.","Welding, I think difficult comps. I'll start there. That's a business that was up 10% in 2018, it's slightly down in 2019 at current run rates. We're estimating down 2 to plus 2, and that's really, as much as we know at this point. We know that in all of our businesses, regardless of what the environment throws at us, we will react accordingly. And manage the cost side of the equation as we always do. Like we did in 2019 and 2020 will not be different, but I don't have a better -- we don't have a better crystal ball than you in terms of what welding might look like other than, we're using current run rates and\u2026","Scott Santi","And the underlying activity, it's far from terrible in terms of the amount of\u2026","Michael Larsen","Yes.","Scott Santi","The assumption going on. We saw a pretty big pullback in cap spending on, in welling and other places in '19, but I think our assumptions for 20 or certainly not for improvement in the CapEx investment side of that. But I think steady state is a reasonable assumption given the underlying. And input we're getting from our customers and we're seeing in terms of the actual sort of consumption of welding consumables, et cetera.","Jamie Cook","Thanks. I'll let someone ask a question. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Richie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Richie","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Happy Friday. So, my first question, I guess I'm trying to understand what comprises the low-end of your guidance. Since it would imply deceleration in earnings at a time when you're expecting, growth to be a little bit better and for margins to still be there?","Michael Larsen","Well, I mean, I think -- like I said earlier, we were in a pretty challenging demand environment. And in the guidance range, what we try to do is account for a wide range of possible scenarios. I think the biggest swing factor here will be the overall demand environment. And so if things remain where they are you know, we'll be likely closer to the mid point, if things accelerate from a demand standpoint, we'll be at the high end or, or above. And if things slow further, we'll be at the lower end. So I think that's really the, the best answer. I can give you the remainder of the items, you know, the initiatives.","We've clear line of sight as I think Scott said earlier, do all the projects and activities and that'll generate those savings. We know what the share repurchase program in terms of share count will do. Currency, tax we're using, the rates that we gave you. And so I think those are -- there's a lot less variation around those. The swing factor here is whether the overall demand environment and in the near-term this situation in China that needs to be sorted out. And so we're keeping a close eye on that. So that's probably the best I can give you.","Joe Richie","Okay. That's helpful Michael. And maybe -- my quick follow-up here is, I'm thinking about the cadence both from a growth and from a margin perspective, is the expectation as we kind of start 2020, that growth remains negative and then turns positive as the year progresses. And then, specifically on margins, you guys front end loaded, your restructuring last year. How should we think about that 40 basis point impact in 2020 you're going to front-end the 2020 as well.","Michael Larsen","No. That's not the current plan on the restructuring, I think it'll be more kind of equally spread throughout the year. If the demand environment deteriorates, we can obviously adjust. I think on your first question. So as you appreciate, we don't provide quarterly guidance anymore. I think if you look at kind of historically at how organic growth and margins and EPS kind of plays out through the year. If you look at historical averages, you can get pretty close to a reasonable scenario here. I think in Q1, we have this added uncertainty around China. So we'll have to see where the organic growth rate ends up. And then I think on margins, typically what you see in Q1 is some margin improvement year-over -ear. And then sequentially Q2 Q3 gets better. And then Q4 is slightly lower. So if you look at these historical trends Joe, I think you can -- I think that's pretty informative as you think about 2020.","Joe Richie","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. I know that the commercial construction piece of your construction business is not the biggest, but you've had some helpful and interesting perspectives on that in recent quarters. Just curious what your view is at this point, what you're seeing and assuming going forward on a commercial piece.","Michael Larsen","Yes. So the commercial business can be a little lumpy on a quarterly basis. Really they're related to the timing of projects. So 5% in the quarter was certainly one of the better numbers from that business. I think if you look at the full year the business construction and the commercial side is actually down low single digits. And so, I think we expect a current runway rates, it'll be a similar to that in 2020. So I wouldn't expect a significant acceleration in 2020 and again, the Q4 number at 5% is at the high-end of what this business typically does.","Steven Fisher","Okay. That's helpful. And then just to follow up again on welding, where does the current run rate of business puts you within that range of minus 2 to plus 2. I know you said you're, this is of the businesses where you're assuming a wider range of outcome. So just curious where that -- where it puts you in that range and because it, it does seem like, there could be some additional headwinds there. So I'm also wondering if within that consumable piece that's keeping it relatively steady overall, are there some of the drivers that are more positive and some that are more negative.","Michael Larsen","Well, I think to answer your question, we try to do is bracket kind of the mid point of what the runway would suggest for 2020, adjusted for typical seasonality. So that's probably the best I can give you pro welding. So, our capital goods to consumable ratio and welding is 60.","Scott Santi","I think as you know, our product mix, the geographic mix is quite different than some of our peers in this space. So we are more weighted on the equipment side. That's where the technology is. That's where the higher margins are relative to the consumable side. And you know, we're more weighted towards the North American market, which represents almost 80% of our business.","Steven Fisher","And there's no way within that segment the end markets that are driving the demand there. Any that are up in any that are down or you're all seeing them kind of moving in the same direction?","Michael Larsen","No, I think, the industrial side, so think more heavy equipment. There's certainly some contraction and demand there down those single digits. I think the commercial side, which is more the smaller businesses, personal users that's more flattish at this point. And I think we gave you oil and gas earlier. Was I think down 2%. And so that's probably as much color as I can give you a welding.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our last question will come from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking me in. I think you have covered a lot of ground here. So I want to keep this kind of fairly high level. So, I think we now in the eighth year of maybe seventh, eighth year of the enterprise initiatives and obviously it's been very successful. It seems like most of the benefits really come through on the SG&A line in the last sort of three or four years. You talked about strategic sourcing is a big 10 a driver this year, Scott and wanting to other things as well. But do you think that we're now at a level where the benefits will come more in the gross margin line and maybe on top of that, do you think there's more scope to take down SG&A below 16% going forward?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think Nigel, so far contributions from 80\/ 20 and sourcing have been fairly equal, we divided I think under the go forward basis we may see a little bit more impact on the VM side. But, I think overall the important thing is what we talked about earlier, another solid 100 basis points this year and from the enterprise initiatives, what the exact geography will look like. We'll see as the year unfolds.","Maybe a little bit more, like I said, on the variable side of things. But overall, what's really encouraging is every segment continues to execute and identify projects, just look at Q4, the range of contribution here is from 80 to -- all the way to 200 basis points and overall 130 basis points in the fourth quarter.","So that's probably as much as, yes\u2026","Scott Santi","I think the only thing I would add is the way this gets executed. We're not going after some ratio on the P& L. We're simplifying business processes. We're improving how we execute. In terms of certainly from the standpoint of productivity and efficiency, but also benefits around how we serve our customers. So none of it is that says, okay, this project, or the focus now is SG&A, the focus is how do we, how do we better support sort of the quality pieces of each of these individual businesses. And so it's hard for me to even think about your question in the sense of sort of where in the geography on the P&L, this is, we're simplifying and improving the effectiveness of the overall performance of the business.","And it certainly is going to adjust the ratios on the P&L as a result. I'm sitting here kind of trying to think about your question and it just is kind of outside of how it actually happens. We improve our practices and we generate outcomes in terms of -- and we're, we focus on the top-line and the bottom-line and ultimately to improve the bottom line, those ratios all have to get better in terms of margin, but ultimately it's not really focused at particular slice of the cost structure, but maybe that looks it up even further.","Nigel Coe","The ratios are not coming on inputs. I think I understand that. And then, just a quick follow-on, and this is definitely for Mike on the inventory. So the 40 bps adjustment, that's a LIFO charge, is that correct?","Michael Larsen","Yes. I mean it's really -- it's the mark-to-market of the inventory given that raw material costs have come down. So as we adjust the standards lower to reflect the lower raw material costs, that's the impact that you're seeing.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I've got a CPA, but inventory accounting is a way to escape me.","Michael Larsen","So, I can promise we will provide a lot of detail in the 10-K that should satisfy even the most advanced CPAs amongst us.","Nigel Coe","So, yes, I'm saying not about CPA, but they just conceptually, the little raw materials close through the price cost line, and then we've got a mark-to-market at year end, is that, does that sort of just in a very simplistic way to think about it?","Michael Larsen","In very simple terms, that's how it works. Yes.","Nigel Coe","Yes. Great. Thanks Mike.","Michael Larsen","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions. We turn the call back over to Ms. Fletcher for closing remarks.","Karen Fletcher","Okay. Thanks for joining us this morning. I know it's a busy day for everybody.

Thank you sir, you may begin.","Aaron Hoffman","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me this morning on our call our CEO, Scott Santi and Michael Larsen our CFO. ","During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our Q4 and full year financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. Before we get to the results let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 first quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking questions identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2014 Form 10-Q for the second quarter for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures; a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Santi ","Thanks, Aaron and good morning. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we continued to execute well on our enterprise strategy. In the fourth quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.18, which was an increase of 28% versus Q4 of last year and $0.07 above the midpoint of our forecast. This above forecast earnings performance was driven primarily by margin performance that came in at the high end of what we expected heading into the quarter. Q4 operating margin improved to 190 basis points year-on-year with a 120 basis points of that improvement coming from enterprise strategy initiatives.","Organic revenues in the quarter were up 2.3%, largely in line with our forecast with ongoing product line simplification activities reducing organic growth by roughly 1%. The quarter kept the solid year for ITW. For the full year, earnings per share increased 29%, operating income of 2.9 billion, and operating margin of 19.9% were above all time records for the company. After tax return on invested capital improved 260 basis points to 18.9%. In 2014, we made significant progress on the execution of our strategy as we simplified the company through our business structure simplification initiative and generated cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiative that exceeded our plan.","We also completed the heavy lifting with regard to divestitures associated with our portfolio management initiative, while our divisions continued to be very active in refining and narrowing the focus of their business portfolios through the implementation of our product line and customer base simplification initiatives. Free cash flow was strong in 2014 and came in at 110% of adjusted net income through the combination of our strong free cash flow and divestiture proceeds. In 2014, we were able to return a record 5 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and increased dividends.","In summary, ITW's unique and highly differentiated business model is delivering strong results as we continue to execute our strategy. As we enter year three of our five year plan, we are well positioned to deliver another year of solid progress in 2015. I\u2019d like to close by thanking all of our people around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. Starting with the financial summary on page 4, fourth quarter EPS was a $1.18, an increase of 28% versus prior year. The EPS number included $0.04 of currency related headwinds versus prior year. Enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion and led to operating margin of 19.6% and operating income of 686 million. Also good progress on the after tax return on invested capital metric with an improvement of 220 basis points to 18.6%. Revenues were 3.5 billion, up 2.3% organically after the expected 1 percentage point impact from product line simplification.","Foreign currency translation reduced revenues by 3.5% resulting in total revenues declining 1.4%. Cash generation was as expected with pre-operating cash flow conversion at 124%, and we allocated $800 million to our share repurchase program in the quarter. The ending diluted share count was 386 million. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the results in the quarter and the positive momentum going into 2015. Turning to revenue by geography, organic revenue was up 2.3% with positive growth in all major geographies. North America up 3% as a result of strength in welding up 10%, food equipment up 5%, and automotive OEM up 4%.","International growth was stable up 2% with Europe up 1% driven by automotive OEM up 12% and food equipment up 5%. Asia-Pacific and South America were both up 2% with China up 4% on strength in automotive OEM, food equipment, and Test & Measurement and Electronics all up 10%. So 2.3% organic growth after the ongoing product line simplification activities that reduced organic growth by roughly 1% in the quarter. ","On page 6, operating margin exceeded our expectations going into the quarter, had solid execution on the enterprise initiatives led to an operating margin of 19.6%, an increase of 190 basis points from last year.","Margin expansion was broad based with six of seven segments expanding margins by more than 100 basis points in the quarter. On the right side, you can see the key drivers of the margin expansion with the largest contribution, 120 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Operating leverage was 60 basis points and price cost was favorable for a total of 190 basis points of margin expansion.","So, overall solid progress in operating margin, and we continue to have significant potential to further leverage the enterprise initiatives and expand margin as we move forward.","On page seven the 2014 financial summary, just a couple of the highlights to recap the year and set the stage for 2015. Earnings per share of $4.67, increased 29% over 2013 with operating margin and operating income at all-time highs. Operating margin of 19.9% improved 210 basis points with 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue growth was 2.6% and in our expected range of 2% to 3%, and throughout the year PLS reduced revenues by about 1 percentage point.","Cash flow was strong with 110% cash conversion, and we returned over 5 billion to shareholders, 4.3 billion in buyback and 700 million in dividends across the key financial metrics, solid performance, and positive momentum going into 2015.","Turning to the segments, let\u2019s start with the left side with full year segment results for organic revenue growth and operating margin improvement as you can see good progress on margin improvement across the board with more run-way from enterprise initiatives in 2015. In the automotive OEM segment, another good quarter and a solid year. Organic revenue in the quarter grew 7% compared to worldwide auto builds of 1%. By geography, European organic revenues stood out up 12% with new products and strong penetration gains across all platforms.","In North America, our growth was in line with auto builds at plus 4% as at Detroit 3 where we have above average content, builds actually declined 4% versus the prior year. ","In China, we outperformed auto builds by 4 percentage points. Profitability also improved with operating margin of 22.3%, 190 basis points improvement from last year. We expect automotive OEM to continue to outperform auto builds in a meaningful way and this segment is well positioned for another solid year in 2015.","In our test and measurement and electronics segment, organic revenue decreased 1% in the quarter primarily due to challenging comparisons in test and measurement where organic revenue declined 4%. The electronics business increased organic revenue by 5% as the electronic assembly business grew 11% in the quarter. Operating margin declined slightly due to higher restructuring in the quarter.","Continuing its strong performance, food equipment\u2019s organic growth rate of 5% was broad based across the major product categories and geographies. In North America, equipment organic revenue grew 6% driven by new products and penetration gains in refrigeration and cooking. Internationally, equipment revenue increased 6% driven by strong warewash and refrigeration sales, our service organic revenues increased 2%. The segment operating margin of 21.7% was 220 basis points higher than the prior year, so a solid year for the food equipment group and significant positive momentum going into 2015.","In our polymers and fluids segment, organic revenue increased 1% and operating margin expanded by 150 basis points as this segment continues its progression to 20% plus operating margin. Automotive aftermarket had a good quarter up 2%, polymers was flat. The fluids and hygiene declined 2%.","The welding segment had a solid quarter with organic revenue of 4% driven by continued strength in North America where organic revenue increased 10% due to demand in both industrial and commercial end markets. International organic revenue was down as a result of the challenging year ago comparison and continued product line simplification in Europe. Welding delivered another 230 basis points of margin expansion this quarter bringing margin to 25.4%.","The construction product segment produced organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter. Enterprise initiatives drove 190 basis points of margin expansion this quarter. And as you saw on the previous slide, construction is now at 17% for the year, an increase of 310 basis points versus prior year and well on its way to 20% plus on a sustainable basis.","North America was up 8% with growth in renovation and commercial offset by decline in residential. Asia-Pacific increased 1% for the quarter and Europe organic revenue was down 4% largely due to continued product line simplification and weakness in France offset by strength in the United Kingdom","In the specialty product segment organic revenue was down 3% as a 5% decline in consumer packaging was offset by growth in appliance and ground support equipment. Operating margin of 19% was 110 basis points higher than the year ago period.","That wraps up our segment discussion and turning to our guidance for 2015 and the first quarter; our EPS guidance for 2015 has not changed since our December Investor Meeting. We are maintaining our annual EPS guidance of 5.15 to 5.35, an increase of 12% at the midpoint.","Let me walk you through some of the key assumptions included in our guidance starting with 2.5% to 3.5% organic revenue growth in line with current run rates and what we communicated in December.","As expected, PLS remains at 1 percentage point drag throughout the year. Total revenue is expected to be down 1% to 2% as a result of the impact of foreign currency translation, which creates a 4% headwind at current rates. As for 2015 operating margin, we expect enterprise initiatives to contribute an additional 100 basis points of improvement which will get us to approximately 21% for the full year. ","Our guidance today reflects current exchange rates, which creates $0.25 of EPS headwind, up from $0.15 when we met in December. As we sit here today, we expect the positive momentum that we\u2019ve generated with our enterprise strategy to offset this increased headwind. However, exchange rates remain highly volatile and we\u2019re keeping a close eye on the situation. ","The other topic likely on your mind is the potential impact of lower oil prices. As discussed at our December meeting, ITW revenues into the oil and gas industry are only in the 2% to 3% range and primarily in the welding segment. We continue to expect that any potential reduction in revenues from oil and gas related end markets will be offset by lower input cost for raw materials such as chemicals and resins as well as lower transportation and freight cost.","Overall, we continue to expect that this will be a net neutral for ITW. Couple of housekeeping items includes an expected tax rate of 30% to 31% and restructuring in the range of 70 million to 80 million for the year. Finally, on capital allocation free operating cash flow conversions expected to exceed 100% and we expect to allocate approximately 1.5 billion of our free cash flow to our share repurchase program in 2015. ","So for the year maintaining guidance and well positioned to deliver another year of solid progress towards our enterprise price performance goals. ","For the first quarter, we expect EPS to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.21 an increase of 16% at the midpoint of $1.17. This includes $0.07 of EPS headwinds from currency at current rates. ","Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 3% and our enterprise initiatives are expected to generate about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. ","Finally, share repurchase is expected to at least 500 million in the quarter. ","In summary, the positive momentum and strong execution in ITW\u2019s enterprise initiatives puts us in a solid position as we enter 2015. We expect 2015 to be another year of strong progress that keeps us firmly on track to deliver on our 2017 performance goals. With that, let me turn it back over to Aaron.","Aaron Hoffman","Thanks Michael. We\u2019ll now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question and remember our policy of one question and one follow up question only. So with that, let\u2019s turn to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO.","Joel Tiss ","Well, I usually barely make it at the end. How are you doing guys? It looks like you\u2019re kind of reaching or you\u2019re moving toward your 2017 goals a little faster than expected, is there more benefit you\u2019re getting from your initiatives or do you think you\u2019re going to finish early or I\u2019m just trying to or you\u2019re going to have to enhance your plans as we go down the road? I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s going on at the operating level?","Scott Santi ","Well, the way I would characterize it is, I think we\u2019re largely on track. We did update our margin goal in December for 2017 to be in the 23% range, that\u2019s certainly reflective of the progress generated to date and also what we see ahead in terms of additional opportunity around these initiatives, but again I think we\u2019re largely where we expect to be executing and making progress quarter-by-quarter and still remain on track with what we\u2019ve set out to do two years ago.","Operator","Thank you, next question is Andy Kaplowitz of Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz","Hey guys, how are you? Nice quarter. So Scott, you talked about welding a bit, you guys talked about oil and gas that is within welding, but it was up very strong 10% and we know oil and gas has been slow, but you\u2019ve also talked in the past about it being more downstream and midstream. So, as we look at welding in 2015, can you give us a little more clarity about what you think the non-oil and gas businesses will do and then maybe have you gotten more color since the December Analyst Day on what you think oil and gas will do in the business?","Scott Santi","I would say relative to the second part of your question, we haven\u2019t seen any real noticeable change in terms of buying behavior out the oil and gas segment to date. That certainly doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t expect there to be some impact from that as we go forward. But on the ground in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t see any significant change relative to the run rates we had from the oil and gas sector heading into the quarter. ","On an overall basis for \u201915, I think what we saw that was encouraging was some noticeable improvement in demand in North America through the back half of the year, given certainly the volatility of the current environment, I don\u2019t know that we have anything that we would say is leading us to believe that that won't continue as we go forward, and so I think we\u2019re pleased with the momentum that\u2019s been building there and expect it to continue at a moderate level through \u201915.","Andy Kaplowitz","And Scott let me back up to your last response and just ask you in general, you mentioned the volatility of the market, you can see some of the other guys report on what they\u2019re doing. But you guys have been doing pretty well, it looks like Europe is holding up for you, but it\u2019s pretty heavily weighted towards your auto outperformance and the food equipment. So is there a way to characterize what you see in the different geographies, specifically Europe and U.S., did you see any change in order patterns throughout the end of the year last year and as you started here in January or is it sort of just steady as you go and we can expect the outperformance that we usually get from ITW?","Scott Santi","Well, the answer to that is, we really haven\u2019t seen any change I think, from an overall demand standpoint, Q4 I think things held up pretty well right in line with our expectations certainly consistent with Q3 run rate. So, as we\u2019ve talked before, our planning is built on demand that we\u2019re actually seeing on the ground, and as it relates to Q4, things held up pretty well certainly on track again with expectations and consistent with Q3 run rates.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay, and throughout Europe as well and major businesses.","Scott Santi","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Good morning and nice quarter, I guess a couple of questions, one within the construction products division, the North America up 8% driven by renovation and commercial was encouraging. You guys have been less optimistic on commercial construction. So can you sort of talk about any change in your outlook, does this get you more excited in what you think potentially, the effect of energy is on the construction business? ","And then my last question just I am sorry if I missed it, what is your assumption on sort of price cost with -- you talked about some of the tailwinds that you could from resin chemicals, et cetera. Has that changed relative to your December outlook meeting? Thank you.","Scott Santi","So let\u2019s start on the construction side. So if you look at the total segment, we were up 2% in line with what we\u2019ve done really throughout 2014. And so, we\u2019ve been growing in the low single digits in the construction segment, and we\u2019re not expecting things to improve much as we go into 2015. Certainly, there are some encouraging headlines but that is -- we're not counting on it as we go into 2015.","North America was up 8%, we saw some strength in renovation, some slight growth on the commercial side and then a decline in residential. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about the number of North America 8%. We expect this to continue kind of along with the run rates that we saw in 2014, so low single digit type growth is how we would characterize the construction in North America with some optimism given some of the headlines.","On the price cost side, we had 10 points of favorability in 2014. That is still our base assumption for 2015, but clearly as we\u2019ve talked about the impact of lower crude oil prices and what that may mean to our purchase of chemicals, resins, certainly our transportation and freight costs, we would expect as those savings come through to see an improvement in our price cost metric. For now, we are holding on to the base assumption here at 10 basis points favorable and we\u2019ll keep you posted as we go through the quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andy Casey","Good morning everybody. A question on -- it\u2019s kind of a specific question, but in North America did you see any benefit in any of your business from the late passage through the Section 179?","Scott Santi","No I think as we went through the quarter here really this behaved in line with our expectations. We had a strong finish in December but we always do. And so there was really nothing unusual about the fourth quarter as it unfolded.","Andy Casey","Okay, thank you. And then as you look at polymers and fluids going through 2015, are you expecting full year pretty consistent impact from PLS initiatives or does that taper off as you go through the year?","Scott Santi","Well, I think that -- as it relates to that segment specifically they have been doing some real heavy lifting with respect to PLS and are getting close to -- getting through the end of that process. So we would expect that to start to dissipate here as we move through \u201915.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets.","Ajay Kejriwal","Thank you. Good morning. Scott just maybe on the enterprise initiatives I know you gave [a lot of] [ph] detail at the December meeting. Maybe an update on BSS in terms of what are some of the major items things that you\u2019ve been looking to achieve in the course of this year? ","And then also on sourcing does the recent moves in commodity pricing that has held that how you think about the sourcing gains during the course of this year?","Scott Santi ","Ajay the connection was a little static so I\u2019m going to -- I think the questions related to some commentary around where we with respect to BSS execution and the second is around sourcing impact relative to lower energy prices and the impact those might have on commodities. Regarding BSS I think we continue to make good progress. I have been very pleased with both the quality and the pace of execution and this is, there has been a lot of moving parts inside the company in support of this initiative and our mantra from day one with our divisions was that we had a lot of important work to do but ultimately we\u2019re going to do that in a way that didn\u2019t impair our ability to serve our customers or deliver for our shareholders throughout and I think we largely been able to sustain that from day one.","It is a five year process not a -- and we\u2019re certainly heading into the year three of that. I think organizationally we've got the organizations that we want in place but we\u2019re still doing a lot of work down at the individual division level in terms of plan consolidation, facility consolidations and really getting these businesses in a position to fully operate a single entity global divisions. That work continues. I think we\u2019re well on track but we have a fair load of work still to do in \u201915 and probably a decent amount in \u201916 on that as well.","As it relates to on the sourcing side we are -- any energy savings that accrued this year would be and that\u2019s something we would talk about as it relates to our sourcing initiative that would reflected in our price cost reporting. Sourcing initiatives is much more around permanent changes and structural cost as a result of a much more focused 80-20 driven effort around improving the efficiency with through which we source raw materials. So, as Michael talked about earlier there is certainly some potential for some benefit on this on the input cost side related to lower energy prices but that is something that we would not report as part of our sourcing initiative, we would talk about that as a price cost benefit as we moved down the road.","Ajay Kejriwal","And then Michael on FX, can you talk about hedging, how do you think about your FX exposures, how much is naturally hedged versus through contracts? Thank you.","Michael Larsen","Yes, so Ajay, I just maybe reiterate on the sensitivities around foreign exchange and when we were together in December we gave you a rough rule of thumb, I gave everybody a rough rule of thumb that said a penny change in the euro versus dollar rate equates to a penny of EPS on an annualized basis and obviously since then the euro has weakened versus the dollar to a tune of about $0.10 and so that\u2019s the $0.25 of headwind that we talked about now versus the \u201915 in December and obviously all currencies are moving. So, this is the rough rule of thumb.","Well in terms of hedging, we are well hedged naturally, so we\u2019re a company that manufactures in the regions that we sell into and so this is really just the translation impact for ITW, there are no mismatches in terms of revenues and cost, no structural issues to speak of that need to be addressed here and so beyond that we\u2019re all looking at the same currency rates, we told you what the sensitivities are and in terms of operationally our view hasn\u2019t really changed and the way we run the company hasn\u2019t really changed but obviously the way we report our earnings when we consolidate and back into the U.S. are impacted by currency.","Ajay Kejriwal","But we\u2019re not a hedger of translation risk.","Michael Larsen","That\u2019s correct, yes.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is Walter Liptak of Global Hunter.","Walter Liptak ","Hi, thanks. Good quarter guys. Wanted to ask you about the welding segment and if you could break out the North America and give us some indication of price versus volume.","Michael Larsen","We typically do not go into that level of detail for competitive reasons Walter, so we\u2019re not going to go there today I think there is really nothing unusual here.","Scott Santi ","The plus standard would be largely volume.","Michael Larsen","Yes, I mean it\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters nothing unusual.","Walter Liptak ","Okay, got it. And then another question, not a follow up but in the electronics segment you had that plus 11% growth and I wonder if we can get some color on that, the products that, that was going into the geographic regions and trying to get an idea if that's sustainable as you go further into 2015?","Michael Larsen","I think the increase we were talking about was in the electronic assembly piece primarily sold into Asia, that business can be a little bit lumpy. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into one or two quarters here, we\u2019re certainly encouraged by what we saw in the third and the fourth quarter but the long term growth rate here is unfortunately probably a little bit lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter and probably in the low to mid-single digits in that segment.","Operator","Thank you, next question is from Rob Wertheimer of Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer ","Hi, not to circle around again but it just seems as though that the risk -- the benefit on the materials cost side and we\u2019ve had a long period of inflation against this kind of flip flop in the last year or so. Have you had more pushback that you\u2019re hearing from your sales staffs on pricing on getting any kind of pricing through that they\u2019re being asked for pass-through or is it really the net risk really does lay your way?","Michael Larsen","I mean there\u2019s really been no changes in terms of how we look at price cost inside the company and no increased pushback to your question.","Robert Wertheimer ","Okay, thanks. And then just real quickly on food service, curious about the general feeling in the market propensity to spend whether you\u2019re seeing people do positive capital decisions or whether doing more replacement. I am just curious about what you feel the rest of the market like? Thanks.","Scott Santi ","The environment overall is still -- I would certainly not describe it as a market with a lot of tailwind. Lot of what we\u2019re benefiting from right now is at number of meaningful new product launches that are -- certainly given us an extra 2% or 3% of organic growth. I think that\u2019s the best color I can give you on it for now is no big changes in demand over the course of the last year but we\u2019ve seen our own growth rate accelerate as we move through the year largely because of some the product commercializations.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher","The test and measurement segment was down on tougher comps in the quarter. What do you expect there for 2015 and do you have any visibility to that showing some growth next year or this year?","Michael Larsen","Yes so if you recall in the fourth quarter \u201913 that business test and measurement was up 8% or 9% organically -- 9% organically. And I think as we look forward into 2015, we expect similar to what we saw in 2014 so in the low to mid-single digits as Scott said earlier and we\u2019ve said many times we in our guidance the way we model this is at current rates. So we expect that test and measurement to be at that low to mid-single digit type growth for 2015.","Steven Fisher","Okay, great. And not sure if I missed it but the China 4% growth in the quarter and how you see that playing out in 2015?","Michael Larsen","China for us is really primarily driven by the strong performance in our automotive business that continues to outperform in a meaningful way. We also had in the quarter food equipment primarily as a result of an acquisition we did little over year ago. And that\u2019s based strong growth in food equipment and then we talked a little bit about the polymers and fluids business also being positive in China.","So the offset here is primarily similar to what we talked about in the third quarter is the welding business where we continue to see some -- two things going on one is product line simplification where we\u2019ve exited some business lines that didn\u2019t meet our threshold from a large end standpoint and then some projects that are still being delayed in China. So I would expect China -- if you look at China for the year we\u2019ve kind of been in that mid-single digit type growth rate and based on the continued outperformance in automotive and food equipment we\u2019d expect that to continue.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time we\u2019re showing no further questions.","Scott Santi ","Thank you everyone for your time today. And we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you all again very soon. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Brooklier, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John L. Brooklier","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to ITW's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me on today's call is our President and CEO, Scott Santi. And I would also like to introduce and welcome a new member of the ITW team to today's call, our new CFO, Michael Larsen.","As many of you may recall, Michael joined us last month from Gardner Denver, where he served as both CEO and CFO during his time there. I know Michael looks forward to meeting both our current and prospective investors, as well as the analysts who cover us.","During today's call, Scott, Michael and I will discuss our strong Q3 financial results and also cover our newly updated Q4 and full year forecast. Before we continue, let me do a few housekeeping items. I'd like to remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the full year and the 2013 fourth quarter, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. I won't read through the entire slide, but I'll let you do that as I move to the next slide.","One other housekeeping item. The telephone replay for this conference call is (866) 431-5846. No passcode is necessary, and the playback for the call will be available until 12 midnight, the night of November 5, 2013.","Now let's move on. Let me introduce our CEO, Scott Santi, who will comment on our Q3 performance. Scott?","E. Scott Santi","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Overall, I was pleased with our third quarter performance. In an economic environment that remains choppy at best, we were able to deliver solid operating results while we continued to make meaningful progress in the execution of our enterprise initiatives.","From a geographic perspective, while we are seeing pockets of growth in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe appears to have stabilized, North America remains a mixed bag. Against this backdrop, our Automotive OEM segment continued to deliver strong growth with organic revenues up 11.5% in Q3 versus worldwide auto builds that were up 4% in the quarter.","In addition, we saw a noticeable improvement in the growth trajectory of our Food Equipment segment, where organic revenues were up 4.4% in the quarter. In terms of segment performance, one other element I would highlight is the 250 basis points of year-on-year margin improvement delivered by our Construction Products segment in the quarter. As I have noted previously, we are focused on getting our Construction margins up to ITW standards, and our Construction Products management team made solid progress in this regard in Q3.","Regarding earnings, Q3 EPS of $0.90 came in $0.02 higher than the midpoint of our forecast. Per our announcement last month, we revised our earnings forecast to reflect our plan to divest our Industrial Packaging business and the associated reclassification of the segment into disco. While this -- with this move, we believe investors now have a clear line of sight on our go-forward portfolio and its underlying earnings growth potential.","On our enterprise initiatives, our worldwide management team continued to lead solid execution throughout the organization in Q3. In the quarter, we got 80 basis points of margin contribution directly from our enterprise initiatives, which drove overall enterprise operating margins of 19% in the quarter, a rate that was among the highest in the history of the company.","A final word on capital allocation. We continue to remain return-focused on the best ways to utilize our capital. As you can see from our Q3 results, we continued to generate strong levels of free cash. Our free cash conversion rate through the first 9 months of 2013 was well over 100%. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","And as a reminder, we also announced last month that we intend to utilize our existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of EPS dilution associated with the divestiture of Industrial Packaging.","Now let me turn the call over to Michael, who will now cover Q3 financial highlights. Michael?","Michael M. Larsen","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. First, let me say that I'm very pleased to have joined the ITW team at such an exciting time for the company. I look forward to working with our talented worldwide management team on executing our enterprise strategy, with a strong focus on creating long-term shareholder value. It's great to be here.","Okay. Before I go through our third quarter results, let's start on Slide 5. And since there are a few moving pieces this quarter and not everyone's estimates have been updated since the announcement of September 24, I'd like to quickly walk you through EPS guidance versus actual for the third quarter and full year 2013.","On September 24, we announced the sales process for our Industrial Packaging segment and moved IPG to discontinued operations, which at the midpoint reduced third quarter EPS by $0.14 and the full year by $0.53. At the same time, we announced a $0.09 discrete nonrecurring tax item related to foreign earnings in Australia. And as a result, we reduced our 3Q EPS forecast midpoint from $1.11 to $0.88 and the full year 2013 from $4.20 to $3.58.","Our actual third quarter results had diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.90 or $0.02 better than the September midpoint, primarily as a result of better operational performance. Adding back the $0.09 tax item, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.99, an increase of about 12% versus prior year when you exclude the 2012 Decorative Surfaces operating results.","Turning to Slide 6, let me give you some additional detail on our third quarter performance. As Scott said, this was a good quarter as the ITW team executed well and delivered solid margin expansion and strong cash flows. Total revenues of $3.6 billion increased 2.9% versus prior year. Again, this is excluding Decorative Surfaces. Worldwide organic revenue was up 0.4% as growth internationally was partially offset by North America, and revenue from acquisitions contributed 2.4 percentage points.","While we continue to see a mixed economic environment and had some comp challenges in one of our segments, growth rates in the quarter were encouraging as they improved sequentially from the first half of 2013, and we saw solid growth in several of our segments. We'll get into more detail on geography and segments in a few minutes.","Operating income was $678 million, up 8.4% versus last year, and our operating margins were one of the highlights of the quarter at 19%, 110 basis points higher than last year. We're pleased with the progress and momentum on our strategic initiatives as we enter into the fourth quarter and 2014. And while 19% operating margins in the quarter and 17.8% on a year-to-date basis are positive signs, we clearly expect that there's more to come as we execute well on the strategy.","On Slide 7, organic revenue is up 0.4% for the quarter versus being down 1.1% in the first half of '13. We continue to see strength in Automotive OEM, up nearly 12% organically. And we're also encouraged by a 4% organic growth in Food Equipment, including growth in the higher margin service business. We also saw positive across-the-board momentum in our North American Construction business, which increased 9%. As usual, John will cover the segment performance in greater detail in a few slides.","Looking at organic growth by geography, our international revenues were up 2.9% in the quarter, with Asia-Pacific organic revenues increasing nearly 7%, led by strong growth in China. Our European organic revenues were positive, up 1% in the quarter, which marks the first quarter of organic growth in Europe since the first quarter of 2012.","While our North American organic revenues decreased 1.4%, the softness was largely driven by electronics assembly platform. As we mentioned last quarter, we're dealing with difficult comps from last year, which will ease here in the fourth quarter. Excluding the electronics assembly platform, our total company organic revenues are up 2.6% in North America and up 2.9% on a worldwide basis.","Acquisitions added 2.4 percentage points of revenue growth, led by 2 international acquisitions this quarter, a European Consumer Packaging equipment business and a Chinese Food Equipment business, which gives us entry to the fast-growing Chinese Western cooking industry. I should mention that while it's still early days, the acquisitions are performing in line with our expectations.","Like I mentioned, operating margins for the quarter were 19%, up 110 basis points from last year, as base business margins were up 120 basis points. Key drivers of the margin expansion was 80 basis points from our enterprise initiatives, largely related to our simplification initiatives, as well as benefits from strategic sourcing. Price cost favorability also improved margins 30 basis points.","In summary, we're encouraged by some of the recent revenue trends in the quarter and remain focused on executing on our enterprise strategy to deliver our margin expansion, cash flow and strong returns.","On Slide 8, free operating cash flow of $732 million for the quarter was an increase of 34% versus prior year. And on a year-to-date basis, net cash provided from operating activities was about $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $257 million, resulting in free operating cash flow of about $1.6 billion as we converted free operating cash on 110% of adjusted net income on a year-to-date basis. Returns are also trending well as adjusted return on invested capital on a year-to-date basis was 16.3%, 110 basis improvement versus last year.","On Slide 9, a quick update on our disciplined capital allocation. In the third quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares, and on a year-to-date basis, we repurchased 15.6 million shares. Our ending share count for the third quarter was 443.8 million shares.","The remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6.8 billion. And as announced in September, we intend to utilize it to offset the IPG divestiture-related EPS dilution by repurchasing approximately 50 million shares funded through a combination of sales proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional leverage. Our debt ratios, as you can see, are largely unchanged. And considering our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we continue to have plenty of flexibility from a capital structure standpoint.","With that, I'll turn it back over to John for some additional color on the quarter. John?","John L. Brooklier","Thanks, Michael. I'll take just a few moments to review our Q3 geographic trends on Slide 10. As Michael noted earlier, our reported organic revenues increased 0.4%, with international revenues growing 3% and North America organic revenues decreasing about 1%.","Internationally, an important number for us was European revenue growth of 1% in Q3. This gives us even more conviction that at a minimum, Europe has formed a strong base level. We also like what we saw in China and Australia\/New Zealand. Organic revenues grew 22% and 5%, respectively, in the quarter.","Now let's move to Slide 11. For our Q3 segment results, I'll cover the underlying organic growth details for these and other segments on the following slide. Let's focus on the profitability side. It's important to note that in aggregate, we had 6 out of 7 segments produce operating margin gains in the quarter, with Auto OEM, Polymers & Fluids and Construction Products generating operating margin improvement of at least 200 basis points in the quarter. We are encouraged by the breadth of contributions to our improving operating margin performance.","Now let's move to Slide 12 and take a brief look at our reporting segments. Starting with our Test & Measurement Electronics segment, organic revenues declined 12%. By category, total Electronics organic revenues fell 21%, largely due to the aforementioned comp issue related to our electronics assembly business. The better news is that we expect this comp to be far less negative in Q4.","Also, please note that our other group of electronics businesses, which include the majority of category revenues and consist of adhesives, contamination control, electronic packaging and electrostatic control products, that part of the portfolio grew 5% in Q3.","In Test & Measurement, organic revenues declined a very modest 1%. And to put this segment profitability in context, please remember that operating margins for the entire segment still totaled a solid 16.3% in Q3.","On the Automotive OEM segment, once again, it was ITW's fastest growing segment. In total, Auto OEM's organic revenues grew approximately 12% versus a worldwide auto build of 4%. In Q3, the story was the same as prior quarters. Our advanced value-added engineering of products to worldwide OEMs helped us grow well above auto builds.","By geography, international organic revenues grew 13%. And notably, European organic revenues increased 9% even as auto builds only grew 2% in that region. In Asia Pacific, our organic revenues grew 24%, thanks in large part to our rapidly growing China auto business, which was up 40% in Q3. And by comparison, China auto builds were only up 9% in the quarter.","And in North America, organic revenues grew 10% versus an auto build increase of 6%. All in all, this was another very strong quarter of growth and profitability from our Auto OEM business.","In our Polymers and Fluids segment, organic revenues were flat but showed sequential improvement from prior quarters as we started to anniversary easier comps based on some of the product line simplification activity from 2012. Segment organic revenues declined 7% in Q1 and decreased 4% in Q2.","In Q3, the best news stem from our auto aftermarket businesses that produced organic revenue growth of 2%. Growth in this category was driven by our North American engine repair and car care businesses. In our polymers and hygiene, as well as fluids categories, organic revenues declined 1% and 2%, respectively, due to residual PLS activities and assorted end market weakness in these platforms. In Q3, however, operating margins hit 18.1% for the segment. And as noted earlier, that's 220 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","Moving to Food Equipment. We clearly saw improving end market conditions and better sales focus drive the best organic performance of the year for Food Equipment. As Scott noted earlier, total organic revenues grew 4% in the quarter, with strong growth and profitability contributions from the North American and international equipment and service businesses.","In North America, equipment and service-related organic revenues grew 2% and 8%, respectively. The growth in North America service was due to new customer signings. Internationally, equipment and service produced organic revenue growth of 4% and 5%, respectively. And the growth in international equipment relates to new product launches from our European warewash business, as well as better sales from our U.K. refrigeration business. Operating margins of nearly 20% were 90 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","Moving to the Welding segment. Worldwide organic revenues declined 4%. Organic revenues for our international North American categories decreased 11% and 1%, respectively. Notably, equipment revenues were positive, but consumable revenues were negative in the quarter. Internationally, organic revenues fell largely as a result of our Asian business continuing to transition its portfolio from the low-margin shipbuilding revenues to higher-margin business associated with oil and gas as well as infrastructure projects.","In North America, organic revenues were modestly negative. Despite lower-than-expected organic revenues in this particular segment, operating margins continued to be very strong at 25.4% for the quarter, and that's 90 basis points of improvement versus last year.","We should note our Construction Products segment, we produced an array of encouraging numbers as organic revenues grew 3% for the entire segment in the quarter. North American construction organic revenues increased 9%, with residential up 13%, renovation up 16% and even our commercial construction category was up 5% versus the year-ago period. So good news on the North American side.","Internationally was a tale of 2 geographies. Asia-Pacific organic revenues grew 4%, largely on improving markets and better sales activity in Australia\/New Zealand. In Europe, organic revenues declined 4% as government spending and commercial construction projects remained a bit weak.","Notably, segment operating margins continued their upward climb during 2013 to 16.2% in Q3. As mentioned earlier, that's 250 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","In Specialty Products, segment organic revenues grew 2% in the quarter, and segment growth was helped by 3% worldwide organic growth from our Consumer Packaging business. Within Consumer Packaging, Q3 highlights include new business pickups at our Hi-Cone Brazil business, as well as growth in our warehouse automation category of businesses. The offset to that was worldwide appliance, where organic revenues declined 1% in the quarter as white good sales were sluggish in Europe. Q3 segment operating margins of 21.1% remain strong or 150 basis points higher than the year-ago period.","Now having done that, let's turn the call back over to Michael, who will update you on our Q4 and full year forecast.","Michael M. Larsen","All right. Thanks, John. So on Slide 13 and as a reminder, our forecast has IPG and discontinued operations and our 2012 comps on this page exclude Decorative Surfaces.","So starting with the fourth quarter, we expect diluted EPS from continuing operations to be within a range of $0.85 to $0.93, which assumes total adjusted revenue growth of 2% to 5%, and organic year-over-year growth slightly higher than the third quarter. Keep in mind the typical revenue seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter.","Fourth quarter restructuring is in line with the third quarter, and we expect a tax rate of approximately 29% in line with prior quarter guidance. As announced, we are actively repurchasing shares. And while we can't comment on the specific number and timing, we have plans to repurchase more shares in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter.","So for 2013, we expect diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $3.56 to $3.64, with the midpoint of $3.60, up 12% from prior year and up $0.02 from our September guidance, primarily as a result of our third quarter performance.","If you look at the walk at the bottom of the page, starting with our 2012 adjusted EPS of $3.21, base performance and initiative at $0.33 for the year and the other major positive driver here our share buyback program at $0.17 and partially offset by pension and restructuring, which takes us to our 2013 forecast midpoint of $3.60.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John for Q&A.","John L. Brooklier","Thank you, Michael. We'll now open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We will compete the call at the top of the hour, so that leaves roughly 40 minutes for questions. We're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jamie Cook.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. One, on the Construction side, if you could just give a little color on how you think about the margin improvement, what sort of revenue-driven versus what you've done internally? And it also looks like for the first time in a while, commercial construction has turned the corner. So if you could give any color on that front, that would be helpful as well.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I would say that from the standpoint of overall margin, significantly more than 1\/2 the improvement was what I would describe as structural cost improvement rather than revenue-driven. And from the standpoint of commercial activity in North America, what I would say right now is we're certainly encouraged by the uptick we saw in Q3, but I think it's a quarter or 2 more before we call it a trend.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Volkmann.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm going to switch to Automotive if it's all right. Obviously, you guys had been outperforming the market for quite a while here. I guess I'm just trying to think over the next few quarters. As you look at programs that you're on, I would think you'd probably have some visibility into sort of how long this can continue, and I'm curious about your thoughts there.","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I would say based on -- we have about 3 years worth of forward visibility in terms of new content that we are engineering and selling-in. And sitting here today, we feel pretty good about the next 2 or 3 years in Automotive, for sure.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So you'll continue to outperform whatever builds are?","E. Scott Santi","I would expect that, yes.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, where is your comfort level on whatever ratio you want to use, debt-to-cap or debt-to-EBITDA or whatever? And how much leverage theoretically would you be comfortable with as we go forward here?","Michael M. Larsen","Yes. So what I'd say is we're working through the plans here for 2014. Obviously, if you look at our balance sheet and our strong cash flows, we're comfortable with what I would describe as quite a bit more leverage. And really to utilize that for the 50 million shares that we are going to buy back for the IPG-related divestiture. So that will be -- really be a combination of continued strong free cash flow. We had a good quarter here in the third quarter, as well as the sales proceeds and then additional leverage. That would keep us within a range of, I'd say we'd be very comfortable with and wouldn't have a significant impact on our ratings. So I don't have a firm number for you as we sit here today because we're still working through the plans, but that's kind of the framework we're operating within.","Operator","Our next question is from Ajay Kejriwal.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Michael, welcome aboard. So maybe if on margins, obviously, a very strong quarter. A couple of things. One, if you can provide some color on sourcing. Sounds like that contributed to the quarter, so where we are versus expectations and how to think about '14. And then if you can step back, Scott, and maybe talk about the long-term margin goals that you laid out last year, how do you feel given the already very impressive performance, is that 20%-plus goal that is in sight now? Is that goal, you think, conservative?","E. Scott Santi","Well, sort of first question first. What I would say from the standpoint of enterprise impact in the aggregate, we are essentially right where we expect to be. We're tracking the plan. What we talked about a year ago was the fact that the business simplification was going to be more of a contributor towards the earlier half of the 5-year period, and the sourcing initiative was going to be a larger contributor towards the back half, and I think that's exactly how it's playing out. So out of the 80 bps of contribution, certainly, you can expect that more of that -- a larger percentage of that came from the simplification initiative in Q3. And again that's, I think, right in line with what we communicated when we announced this plan a year ago. We continue to build momentum in sourcing, and it's really made a meaningful contribution in the quarter. And I think we've said previously that our overall savings from sourcing will exceed our plan in 2013. As far as the long-term objectives, I think what we said all along was our goals were 20%-plus on both margin and ROIC. This was certainly a nice performance in the third quarter at 19%. I'll remind you that's a quarterly number, what we're -- what we have described in terms of enterprise goal is sort of annual performance, so we are clearly in the third quarter, from a seasonality standpoint, in a place where the revenue helps us in terms overall margins. So it's certainly nice to see the progress and the trajectory. We remain I think very -- very comfortable and very committed to the overall enterprise goals that I've talked about or that we've talked about a year ago. This quarter represents again some nice progress and some continuing momentum. We go back to the -- just the contributions from these initiatives over the prior 3 quarters, we had 40 basis points in Q1, 60 in Q2, 80 in Q3. So I'm pleased with the momentum, what we're building behind this. But ultimately, we're not at a place where we're declaring a new goal. I think the overall enterprise initiatives still are in place and are confident that by 2017, certainly encouraged by the progress we're making that the goals that we put in place are very achievable. I'll leave it at that.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And one quick one on weldings. The consumables business down in the quarter. Is that just a mix shift towards higher margin products or are you seeing any change in the underlying demand characteristics?","E. Scott Santi","I think the biggest impact on a global basis is really the continued downshift in China away from the shipbuilding business. That was largely a consumable position. I think North America, the overall color is and you've heard this from a lot of our customers in terms of the mining industry, some of the heavy equipment manufacturers. That's really where a lot of the sort of market pressure has been. And I think ultimately to see the equipment business be slightly positive in that environment, we feel pretty good about.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","You had called out the swings, I guess, in electronics assembly are -- previously with last year being very strong, this year, weak. Is that a business that's going to continue to sort of careen back and forth? Can you talk about where you think the normal volumes might be and whether you're -- which way you're sizing for?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I -- the way I would describe it is the real sort of volatility in terms of comps that we're dealing with relates to a single customer and what I would describe as a very one-off kind of situation last year. So obviously, a significant impact in the quarter when we're talking about almost 3 full percentage points of impact on organic growth. But I think we're very comfortable with the electronics business we have. We're not a producer of components. We are basically supplying mostly MRO-related products to that industry and where the sort of volatility as it relates to manufacturing equipment used in that industry. And on a go-forward basis, our intention is certainly not to -- or our expectation is we're not going to see this kind of volatility. We're not going to manage the business to either create or try to serve that kind of volatility on a go-forward basis. Another thing I would point out is that the core margins from an operating standpoint in the electronics business in Q3, even at obviously, a low point in the market of north of 20%, if you strip out the amortization and acquisition-related accounting. So from an operating perspective -- we had a lot of value in the business as we own in that sector, but our sort of intentions on a go-forward basis are, certainly, to manage it to -- in a way that we have much more diversity in terms of end customer and end market exposure.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","That was very helpful. And then sort of follow-up on growth, I mean, you guys have been doing great on Automotive, as Steve mentioned, for quite a while now. And you have, over the many years, invested a lot in innovation. Are you able to see down the road in any of your other sub segments whether you've had an acceleration in -- and what you think your innovation payoff is going to be? Can we expect that Automotive to be replicated anywhere else?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think the Automotive business is -- when we talk about sort of rebalancing of the overall growth focus of the company, we've talked about it before and really shifting from a growth model over the last 20 or 25 years, that was over 2\/3 acquisitive to on a go-forward basis now being 2\/3 organic. I think the Automotive business represents a great example of what the rest of the company ultimately is in the process of becoming. We get there, in large part, through a lot of the portfolio work that we've been doing. So as we refocus the portfolio only on areas that have the ability to drive innovation as a core part of the market characteristics in which we operate, it really elevates, from the standpoint of overall impact on the company, our ability to have a certain amount of our organic growth within our own control through the amount of innovation that we drive.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Scott, I'm really impressed with the Food Equipment growth in the quarter, especially compared to last quarter. John mentioned some of the reasons, new product launches and new customer signings. But we know that you're also focused more on fast food and casual dining. Have you seen any fruits of that? And then is it really the European business that turned in the quarter sequentially or Asia? I mean, what resulted in the strong performance?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think a little bit of all of the above. The European business, even the equipment sales, being positive year-on-year in Q3, was a nice step forward. And again some of that was driven back to the prior question on some new product launches in the warewash business in Europe. And what I would say overall in terms of Food Equipment, in terms of the sort of transition, that we've been on a fairly heavy focus around margin improvement in that business for the last 2 years. And I think largely, what this represents are some encouraging signs around our belief that now shift a much more focused business more front and center on a growth agenda. And one quarter in, it's important that obviously, we sustain it going forward from here, but I think it was -- we're very pleased to see growth in both the equipment and the service business in the quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, Scott. And if I could ask you about your 4Q '13 guide. Seasonally, usually in 4Q, you get a drop-off in margins, so I guess I'm not perturbed by what I see. But it's a pretty significant drop off at the midpoint of the revenue range, if I'm doing this right. Is there anything in there, like restructuring seems about the same between 3Q and 4Q. Is it just conservatism, given choppy end-markets? Am I missing something as I look at 4Q versus 3Q margins?","Michael M. Larsen","Yes, and I'd say there's really nothing unusual in here. I think if you go back and look over time, we typically see a 2% to 3% decline in revenues from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, driven by the seasonality in some of our businesses. And so if you take the flow-through on that, that really accounts for the majority of the margin decline here sequentially. I think year-over-year, in terms of margins, we're still going to put up some pretty good numbers, in part given some favorable comparisons. But this is really nothing unusual, kind of typical seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Duignan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can we talk a little bit about the North America construction businesses, the residential, renovation and commercial. You gave good color on Food Equipment about what was kind of market growth versus what ITW specifically did to outgrow the end-markets. Could you talk a little bit about that construction businesses in the same vein?","E. Scott Santi","Yes. What I would say about construction in North America is I think it was, probably, the bulk of the contribution was from overall market lift. As I've said earlier, it's an area that we are very focused around structural cost and margin improvement, so we certainly got innovation agenda there, but it's not one that is front and center at the moment.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, but -- good to know. And then on the price cost side, can you talk a little bit about that? How much is price? How much is cost? Is it the cost of steel has gone down? Or what businesses were impacted, just if you could expand on the price\/cost comment, I'd appreciate it.","Michael M. Larsen","Yes, I mean, we had some material deflation in the quarter in line with a little bit better than prior quarter. And then as the majority of the 30 basis points really came from the price line. And part of that is targeted price increases as a result of some of the PLS work done in some of our segments.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And any segment in particular benefiting or not benefiting?","Michael M. Larsen","Really across the board, I'd say if you look at maybe Polymers & Fluids, strong performance there.","Operator","The next question is from David Raso.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just wonder if you can help us set the parameters for the analyst meeting coming up in December, what we should expect.","John L. Brooklier","Well, you can expect us to give you an update on our enterprise strategies. I mean, that's first and foremost. That will be agenda #1 for us. Then we're also going to be looking at what underlying growth rates are going to be probably for 2014.","E. Scott Santi","I think the overall focus is going to be we're going to provide some sort of drilled-down examples of this enterprise strategy in action, so to speak, in a number of our different businesses.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And it seems like you mentioned you're maybe a bit ahead of plan thinking about maybe even next year on the benefits. I mean, should we expect a resetting of some of those goals or just simply an update on the progress maintaining those goals. I'm just trying to think through...","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think I wouldn't expect any resetting of goals. We said from the beginning that this was a 5-year plan, not a 5-month plan, and we are still on track relative to the 5-year plan. And a lot of the sort of pacing is ultimately going to come much more from the economy than in the kind of tailwind or headwind we get as we move through this 5-year period than any opportunity to accelerate. I think one of the things we've talked in a few of these calls in different forms is that managing the pace of execution is a really important imperative for us. And we've got to make sure that as we are implementing a lot of these changes that certainly are positive in terms of the overall performance of the company, that we are still allowing our businesses the ability to digest those changes at a rate where they can still serve their customers and perform as businesses on a quarter-to-quarter and month-to-month basis. So I wouldn't look for any resetting of goals.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then thinking about the end-market comment, give us some color on '14, just trying to gauge your confidence in Europe getting better. When I think Europe for you, I think Food Equipment and Construction are 2 of your bigger businesses. And Food does seem to be improving while Construction is still kind of down 4% in Europe. Can you just give us maybe a little more color on Europe, how you're thinking of setting up your framework for '14 on what you know at the moment on Europe?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think you've got it. I think Automotive is the third major business for us over there. I think that's -- looks like certainly more of the same. Food Equipment, as I said before, we're encouraged and would feel even better if we see another nice quarter in Q4 heading into '14. And then on the Construction side, I think the market remains weak. And we also have an agenda there that's really focused, as I said before, around sort of structural cost improvement and getting the margins up to a level that are accretive to the overall company's goals. And so regardless of the market environment, we're going to make a lot of progress in Europe next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Mig Dobre.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sticking with Food Equipment, looking at the margin there, I think this might be the best third quarter performance that you guys have had in the last decade or so. And I -- from what I understand, there's been a lot that's been done on the cost side in this segment. Is this basically how we need to be thinking about incremental margins in this segment going forward, looking at the third quarter performance? Can we extrapolate this basically?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think directionally, I think there is -- what you have to keep in mind is there are some business structure simplification and sourcing benefits that are contributing, that if your time horizon is further down the path, these incremental margins are not sustainable once we've sort of developed or sort of generated the full value of the benefits from those initiatives. But on a core margin basis, we've, for a long time, targeted 35% to 38-plus percent incremental margins depending on the business. And I think that's a very -- that will be a target that will stay in place.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then maybe a little more color on China. And obviously, a lot of positive commentary here, but I'm trying to, if you would parse out, what sort of ITW-specific, given your presence in the country and product introductions so on and so forth versus actual, if you would, improvement in demand in China. Can you kind of parse that out for us?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think -- a bit of this story is certainly some sequential overall improvement, but a big part of the overall results are largely driven by Automotive. And Welding's sort of a negative against the overall market pickup there. But in general, we saw modestly better results across the board with the exception of Welding. But in terms of the number -- the business really driving the overall percentage growth, that was largely Automotive.","Operator","Our next question is from Nigel Coe.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just -- I wanted to drill into the share repurchase and your earlier comments that significant scope to raise the leverage ratios. So I'm just wondering, maybe you could just think about how you're thinking about financing the repurchase. And maybe how contingent is the cadence of the repurchase on the actual sale proceeds from Industrial Packaging?","Michael M. Larsen","Well, I mean, obviously, the proceeds from the sale of the packaging business are largely going to be used to repurchase a portion of the 50 million shares that we've been talking about. So I think in terms of the financing kind of similar to the previous question, I mean, we're working through the specifics as we look into the fourth quarter and 2014, in terms of what we're comfortable with, in terms of the pace of the repurchasing of the shares here. And like I've said, I mean, we -- as we continue to perform well with -- on margins and free cash flow, as we look to increase our leverage here in the first half of '14. And then the third portion here is obviously the after-tax sales proceeds from the IPG divestiture. So all those things combined, as we look at kind of the timing and some different scenarios around the timing, are going to drive our repurchases here. What we said today was for the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase more than we did in the third quarter. So we did 5.2 million shares in the third, and we plan to do more than that in the fourth quarter and we'll kind of pace it as we continue to perform well with free cash flow and we get better visibility to the timing around the sale, which we should add that we're very pleased with the progress so far. We're seeing a high level of interest and obviously market conditions for the financing for a potential purchase remain very favorable. And so all those things combined, we'll look at that and kind of lay out our plan. And we'll update you as we go through the year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's really helpful. But just quickly, would you be open to the idea of maybe pre-funding some additional share repurchases with short-term debt . So raising the short-term leverage a little bit higher than, perhaps, the run rate and then taking down short-term debt with the proceeds?","Michael M. Larsen","I'd say right now, we're looking at all the options as we get ourselves ready and finalize the plans for 2014. When the process of rolling up the annual plan from our segments, and that will certainly give us a view of the operating performance. And an outcome of that is our -- the details around our capital allocation strategy for 2014. The big parameters will remain the same in terms of organic investments and the buyback, looking at acquisitions to a lesser extent. And so we'll continue to look at all the parameters and button that up as we wrap up the plan here for '14.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, Michael, you're obviously new to the team. You come at ITW with a fresh pair of eyes. Maybe just let us -- give us some color in terms what you see, where are the strengths and weaknesses of the organization? And I guess specifically, where do you think you can make the biggest impact?","E. Scott Santi","Let's start with the positive.","Michael M. Larsen","So while I am CEO accepted, right? Well, then let me just say, Nigel, I'm excited to be here. I mean, ITW is an American icon. It's been around for over 100 years. A long history of strong performance operationally and financially. I'd say really a unique differentiated business model, a great set of businesses. And I really look forward to working with the management team here and on executing the strategy. If I didn't think the strategy was right, I wouldn't be here, okay? And so I really think that as we continue to execute well and there's some, I'd say, some early indications that we're making good progress, we'll continue to generate a lot of cash. And I look forward to working on the capital allocation. And again, the focus here is on creating long-term shareholder value. So it's a little early, but very pleased to be a part of this.","Operator","Our next question is from Eli Lustgarten.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Very nice quarter. Can we just go back to Welding, and I guess a little more color what's going on. I mean, is Equipment still the dominant piece of that business? And if it is, it says that there's a big drop in consumables side. So can you give us how much the Asia Pacific, you said it was shipbuilding was more consumable. How much of that is the total? Is that -- and what would consumables look like x the big drop in China from -- moving away from shipyard?","E. Scott Santi","The first question, the U.S. is the easier of the series. But from a standpoint of equipment, as a percentage of the overall portfolio, we still remain about 60% equipment and 25% consumables and about 15% a variety of other accessories in Welding. From the standpoint of the overall consumable impact in China versus the rest of the world, I can't really give you that, but we can find that out and get back to you.","John L. Brooklier","The thing I would add is if you look at the North American numbers, Eli, I mean, North America basically down 1 with positive growth on the equipment side. So that tells you that clearly, there was a bigger falloff on the consumables side. We like the fact that the equipment side of the business has -- is still generating positive numbers, which is more of a sort of more of a CapEx story. So I think to the extent that Equipment has stayed up at higher levels for us is a good indicator longer term for the business. I mean, shorter term, consumables have been hit, which I think gets into the whole issue of what discretionary spending is -- what it's looking like in that particular category. But I think we like the long-term effect that or long-term implications for capital equipment in the business, which is the core of the business for us.","E. Scott Santi","And I was just going to add, just go back to the point John made earlier that despite a pretty tough market, we still got improved operating margins 90 basis points in the segment on down revenue.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I mean, the operating margins were fabulous, probably the best way to describe it. And I had one question. It looks like appliances are very -- are not a big part of the business at ITW at this point. Is that a market that you're targeting for future penetration or so? I mean, is...","E. Scott Santi","No, no. It's a business that in terms of the particular niches that we're in, we're very happy with the overall margin and return metrics in the business, but it's not a position that we expect to build out much bigger than it is today.","Operator","Our next question is from John Inch.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just to pick up on the North American Welding consumable aspect. I think you're, perhaps, maybe losing share and maybe even by design to either Colfax, Sea Sub [ph] or Lincoln or could this be a channel-related issue? I'm just curious why all of a sudden, consumables would drop if you're getting little bit of uplift in some other areas.","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think there was a question along these lines after the second quarter, and I think you have to let everybody else come in and see. I think our -- there's been no shift in strategy for us. Our overall approach to Welding is really around where can we add value, where can we innovate, where can we do something unique and special for our customers. And ultimately as we've talked at length, there are large percentages of the consumable business that are -- where that's very difficult to do. And that's sort of by design our overall Welding portfolio, being much more concentrated in equipment, is how we get there but that's not a new strategy in the last quarter. That's been the strategy for the entire 20-plus years we've been in the business. So you can -- whether we're losing share or not in the third quarter, you can wait and see what other competitors report and make your own assessment at that point.","John L. Brooklier","John, it certainly wasn't the case in Q2. We came out first with our number and the question came up and competition was significantly more negative than us.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No. But then I'm just wondering. I mean, obviously, you make more margin on Equipment, right? So as you go through this process of driving margins higher, your Welding margins are fantastic, as Eli suggested. So I don't know, maybe there was something about what you're doing deliberately, for example, you're walking away from some business or maybe you shuttered a plant or something that has an impact temporarily, but gives you a better margin uplift down the road. That's all I was trying to understand.","E. Scott Santi","Nothing strategic. What I would say is that in our view is it's market.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, it's market. Then, Scott, what about the playbook for electronics equipment? I mean, I understand -- I mean, first, I guess it's what, $400 million. I understand it's not going to be a big driver either way, but if you sort of think about what other industrial companies have been doing, right, Dover got out of their electronic assembly and test businesses. Emerson, unfortunately, got out of their power business at the bottom. But this business to your point, it does make pretty good margins even though it got hit on the top line. Maybe I'm trying to understand. I understand why you, perhaps, want to keep it. What's the playbook, though? Like you were sort of saying, \"Well, let's diversify the customer base and maybe do some other things.\" But is this on sort of a 6-month time line to kind of make it a little less volatile? Or is it -- are you going to give it a lot more flexibility than that?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I wouldn't put it on a 6-month time line. I think the overall playbook, what I would point to, is, first of all, the underlying profitability. We make a lot of money in this business and I'm not going to compare what we do versus what other companies might have done because the businesses themselves are different. But ultimately, the overall margin and return profile says that this is a pretty good business. Now we've got to find some ways to manage this volatility issue much more effectively than we have. There's no question about that, and I think it's -- there's certainly some things we can do around that. It's not something that we're interested in seeing get huge inside the company, but it's a good position, where again from a standpoint of the overall return and cash flow metrics, it's a pretty solid business. So I think -- I don't think it's on -- I wouldn't want to imply at all they've some sort of 6-month do-or-die kind of program here. But ultimately, we're very clear and the management team running that business is very clear that we're going to find a way to manage this business in a much less volatile fashion going forward. And I'm pretty confident today that we're going to be able to do that.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So let me ask it in a different way. How soon do you think you can get to a point -- you clearly have initiatives to diversify customers, maybe launch new products, stuff like that. How soon do you think you can get to a point where you're at least satisfied that this looks a lot more like an ITW-like business, far less volatile, and as you point out, very strong profit characteristics?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I think the comp issue is largely gone, we're going to feel just a piece of it in the fourth quarter, but nothing near what we saw in the second and third. So this was largely a one customer issue that was just some very large orders in 2012 that ultimately I don't expect to recur, I'll put it that way.","Operator","Our next question is from Deane Dray.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You can tell that there's been some fundamental changes at ITW if we got this deep into the Q&A and no questions about M&A. And Scott, I know this reflects the whole change in strategy to pivot from 2\/3 growth from M&A to 2\/3 from organic. So I know you'll be able to comment on this at the December meeting, but for today, could you give us some insight into what you're seeing in the organization changes in terms of freeing up all that capacity that used to do 30 to 50 deals per year, how that -- those resources are reallocated, how you're ramping up more focus on customer-backed R&D and so forth and how might that be reflected today and in the next couple of quarters?","E. Scott Santi","Yes, I think the -- what I would say to that, Deane, is that I think we're very clear across the extended management team about what our growth priorities are and what our growth focus is going to be on a go-forward basis. What I want to be careful about though is sort of managing expectations around accelerating organic growth while we've got things like business structure simplification happening in a pretty major way. So from the standpoint of what I talked about earlier in terms of managing the pace of execution, the focus right now is really getting through the large part of BSS. Again, everybody is clear on a go-forward basis that we are going to be much more organic-centric in our growth focus. There are certainly businesses in food -- we talked about several of them in Food Equipment and Auto OEM that are further down the path in that regard. So it's certainly having an impact in terms of strategy and focus, but we're also not yet in a place where we're really stepping on the gas pedal hard because we're also working on these other initiatives that I talked about. So what I expect to see is a sort of prolonged acceleration over the next couple of years in our organic growth rate, not some immediate impact from this flipping the switch, if that makes sense.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure, it does. And might we see spending on the R&D line, customer-backed R&D line begin to inch up? And would you ever separate that from the SG&A side?","E. Scott Santi","I think it's largely, from an R&D spending as a percent of revenue, I -- this issue for us is much more about the portfolio than it has been about any lack of investment in R&D and innovation. We have a patent portfolio of over 12,000 patents. We have had businesses like Welding and Auto OEM that have been investing heavily in customer-centric R&D for a long time. We've also had, prior to this portfolio move, about 25% of our portfolio were because of the sort of commoditizing characteristics of those businesses, the R&D spend has not been all that high. So from a standpoint of accelerated organic growth, the shift in portfolio focus is going to have a much bigger impact, in my view, than any need to sort of accelerate our spending or investment. We've never restricted our investment in R&D, but we've been very thoughtful about investing and only in places where it can really generate significant benefit. I'm sorry, Deane.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, just last question for me is on the M&A outlook. You've got 2 deals that completed that European Consumer Packaging business, the China Food Equipment. Are there -- what's that pipeline look like today? Is it just not actively cultivating? Or is there something that you might be announcing?","E. Scott Santi","Well, there's nothing that we're going to be announcing that's imminent that I'm aware of. I think the overall sort of strategy from an M&A standpoint is we're going to invest in businesses where we can use M&A to accelerate our organic growth rate. And I think the 2 that we did in the second quarter are good examples of that, where we're taking -- we're really positioning a couple of businesses that have some very strong organic prospects to expand those -- their ability to execute on those geographically. So it's certainly part of the conversation but much more down in the overall strategy at the segment level. And that strategy conversation starts with what's the organic growth focus and then, perhaps, how might we supplement that or accelerate that through some very targeted M&A.","Operator","Our last question is from Steven Fisher.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Similar question to Deane's, but on the growth rates. Given that your portfolio has now mostly been restructured, what's going to be the biggest thing to get you from lagging Industrial Production today to beating it over the next few years?","E. Scott Santi","Well, I'll go back to what I talked about before. We -- the portfolio today on a go-forward basis is characterized by a number of businesses that have outgrown Industrial production for a long time. So if you look at Welding as an example, it's been a high single-digit organic grower for the 25-plus years we've been in the business through the cycle. Auto OEM business we've talked about, that's clearly a 400-, 500-basis-point above market grower. Test & Measurement has been another one that, at least, in the relatively short time we've owned it, has been a high single-digit organic grower. So there's already a number of businesses inside the portfolio that have absolutely demonstrated the capability to grow organically well in excess of the underlying growth rates in their markets. Keep in mind that we've been averaging that kind of organic growth in with about 1\/4 of the portfolio for the last 5 or 10 years that have been basically given a 0 growth because of the commoditizing spaces and the negative year-on-year price pressure that you get in those kinds of spaces. So there's an element of just shifting the portfolio that gets us much growth here fundamentally organically. And then what I said before, I think the point that Deane was trying to make is we are absolutely shifting the overall growth focus from acquisitive to organic. And that's going to -- there's no question in my mind that that's going to help further accelerate the overall organic growth performance of the company.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, you've talked in previous quarters about Brazil. I'm not sure if I missed it. Did you give what the growth rate there was in the quarter and what's the underlying trend?","Michael M. Larsen","Yes, growth rate for Brazil was up over 2%, total company.","John L. Brooklier","Okay. Well, thanks, everybody. We appreciate you joining us for the Q3 call, and we look forward to talking to everybody again. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. All lines may disconnect at this time."],"11374":["Illinois Tool Works Inc.

(Operator Instructions) And now I'll hand the call over to your host, Mr. John Brooklier. Sir, you may now begin.","John Brooklier","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ITW's first quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me this morning is our President and CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen.","During today's call, Scott, Michael and I will discuss our Q1 financial results as well as provide more detail on the $0.15 EPS raise for our 2014 full year guidance. At the end, we will open the call to your questions, and per our practice, we ask for your ultimate cooperation on our one question and one follow-up question policy. We have scheduled approximately one hour for today's call.","Before I continue, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2014 second quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2013 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release, which can be found on our website at itw.com.","Couple of other housekeeping items. Replay conference call number is 800-841-8616. No passcode is necessary. The playback will be available until 12 midnight of May 6, 2014.","Finally, one other note, you'll notice that we have updated the format of the slides, which is intended to provide a more streamlined and concise presentation, while keeping the relevant content intact. We view this as another exercise in 80\/20.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Santi, who will comment on the quarter. Scott?","Scott Santi","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. On the whole, we've had a good start to 2014 and we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in executing our enterprise strategy.","In the quarter, operating margins of 18.7% were up 180 basis points and adjusted after-tax return on invested capital was up 240 basis points to 17.2%, representing continued solid progress towards our stated goals of 20%-plus for each of these key metrics by 2017.","Overall, organic growth was solid at 3.3% in the quarter, which we were able to achieve without any meaningful contribution from our Test and Measurement or Welding segments. Two of our strongest organic growth businesses historically due to a CapEx spending environment, they remain sluggish.","An additional note related to the company's organic growth performance in the quarter is that we estimate that the portfolio of actions we have taken over the past two years had roughly a 100 basis point positive impact on the company's overall organic growth rate in Q1.","Earnings per share of $1.01 were up 15% versus Q1 of last year, up 22% if you exclude a one-time gain of $0.05 a share in the prior-year quarter related to the acquisition of a majority interest in the joint venture.","As a result of our operational execution and the progress we were able to make in Q1 on our stated goal to repurchase 50 million shares to offset the earnings per share dilution associated with the divestiture our industrial packaging segment, we are raising our full year, midpoint guidance by $0.15 to $4.55.","The new full year midpoint represents EPS growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. Michael will provide more detail on our revised Q2 and full year EPS forecast during his comments in a couple of minutes.","Before turning the call over to Michael, let me conclude by recognizing and thanking the executive leadership team and all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving their customers and executing on our enterprise strategy. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2, ITW had a good start to the year, as margin expansion and share repurchases contributed to EPS of $1.01, which was the high-end of our guidance range and a year-over-year increase of 15%.","Total revenues were $3.6 billion, up 4.4% versus prior year with organic revenues up 3.3%. International growth was 6.3%, while North America was up 1%. In terms of end-markets, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products, all had good growth in the quarter. As usual, John will provide some more segment detail in a few minutes.","Operating income in the quarter was $667 million, an increase of 16%, as margins expanded 180 basis points to 18.7%. Our enterprise initiatives, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing contributed a combined 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis, with strong execution across our businesses, as five out of seven segments expanded operating margins by more than 100 basis points. We were also pleased with 60% incremental margins in the quarter.","Free operating cash flow for the quarter was $246 million. The conversion rate in the first quarter was driven by typical seasonality and we expect cash flows to increase from here, and our full year conversion rate should be greater than a 100% of net income.","The sale process for the Industrial Packaging business remains on track and we are working towards May 1 closing date. We've accelerated the timing of the IPG-related share repurchase program and bought more than 18 million shares in the first quarter. We now expect to substantially complete the announced 50 million share repurchase program by the end of Q2.","We anticipate that the ending diluted share count for 2Q is going to be approximately 400 million shares. We will discuss the positive impact of the lower share count in our updated guidance in a few minutes. So, in summary, a good start to the year, as the team continues to execute well on the enterprise initiatives.","On Slide 3, our international organic revenue growth was up 6.3%, outpacing North America up 1% in the quarter and total organic was up 3.3%. We continue to see improvement in Europe up 5% with growth across the board, including Automotive OEM, Food Equipments and Test and Measurement.","China and Australia are the key drivers of Asia-Pacific growth, up 7% with double-digit contributions from several businesses, partially offset by declines in Welding. Brazil is still fairly small for ITW, but led the way with an increase of 17%, as our South America organic revenues were up 18%.","Finally, North America up 1% in the quarter with continued strength in Automotive and Food Equipment, while our businesses that are more closely linked to the CapEx cycle, such as Welding and Test and Measurement, were essentially flat. Weather had a fairly limited impact on our North American revenues, although sequentially we did see a slightly stronger March and April is off to a decent start.","Moving to Slide 4. Solid execution across our segments led to margin expansion in the quarter with operating margins of 18.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from last year. In particular, Automotive OEM, Construction Products, Food Equipment and Polymers and Fluids put up some solid margin expansion numbers.","The key drivers of the first quarter margin expansion are listed on the right side of the page. Operating leverage on the topline was 80 basis points and the largest driver of our margin expansion was 120 basis points from the continued progress at our enterprise initiatives. Price cost was 10 basis points and acquisitions are performing well, but reduced margins by 20 basis points.","I'll be back in a few minutes to comment on second quarter and 2014 guidance, but let me first turn it over to John for some additional commentary on the quarter. John?","John Brooklier","Thanks, Michael. On Slide 5, you'll see the breakdown of total revenues and operating income per segment. Michael noted earlier, Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments led the way with 13% and 9% total revenue growth, respectively. Operating income for Auto OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products produced significant year-over-year increases.","Now, let me go further into each of our operating segments. Starting with Automotive OEM, this segment once again was ITW's fastest growing segment with organic revenues up 13% and that's outpacing worldwide auto builds by 8 percentage points.","By geography, Europe grew 14%, North America 11% and China 28%. In Europe, we outperformed European auto builds by 7 percentage points largely due to our successful fuel release and powertrain product lines. In North America, we outpaced auto builds by 5 percentage point led by fasteners and body components. And in China, we continue to gain share with new and existing products.","In sum, this was another very strong quarter of growth and profitability for our Auto OEM business, and the segment's strong operating margin of 23.3% was 350 basis points higher than the year-ago period. One thing I should note is auto builds are forecasted to moderate in the second quarter, but we still expect to maintain good penetration across all geographies.","Moving to the next Slide. In our Test and Measurement and Electronic segment, organic revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. On the Test and Measurement side of the business sluggish CapEx spending and order delays resulted in 1% decline in organic revenues. On the Electronic side, revenues were flat in the quarter as our other electronics category, which includes businesses in areas such as contamination control and pressure-sensitive adhesives, they produced organic revenue growth of 4%.","This was offset, however, by electronics assembly business, which saw organic revenues decline 7% in the quarter due to weak end-market demand. Looking ahead, we expect our Test and Measurement businesses to benefit from more recovery in end-markets and a push out of Q1 orders into the remainder of the year.","Q1 operating margins of 12.2%, down largely as a result of increased restructuring. But I would remind everyone that our core operating margins for this segment, when you adjust for amortization and other cost is still approximately 16%. So the underlying profitability in this segment continues to be good.","In Food Equipments, this segment delivered another very strong quarter globally of organic revenue growth, thanks to new product innovation and increased service capabilities. Total organic revenues grew 5% in Q1. In North America, equipment and service-related organic revenues grew 6% and 5% respectively. And internationally equipment produced strong organic revenue growth of 7% and service organic revenues 2%.","Both improvements over last quarter are driven by growth in Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland. The segment continues to show strong profitability with operating margins of 18.6% and at the 190 basis points higher than year-ago period.","On Slide 7. In our Polymers and Fluids segment, organic revenues were flat, primarily due to ongoing product line simplification, which we refer to as PLS here at ITW and the exiting of some low margin businesses. While growth is still lower than we'd like, the comps are easing, thanks to the work that was done in 2013.","Notably, we did see a pickup in organic revenues in worldwide Fluids and Auto aftermarket. I would note that the Polymers category reflects most of our current PLS activity. The segment's profitability continues to improve with operating margin of 16.6% in the quarter and that's an improvement of 200 basis points versus year ago.","In Welding, worldwide organic revenues declined 2% due to ongoing portfolio repositioning and slower pipeline activity in China as well as sluggish CapEx spending in North America. International organic revenues decline 10% in the quarter and that's mainly due to previously noted factors in China. And in North America, organic revenues grew only 1% and it was largely the result of weak CapEx spending from key customers and key sectors, such as heavy equipment. However, segment operating margins continue to be very strong at 25.7% and remains our most profitable segment company-wide.","Moving to Slide 8. We continue to be very pleased with the topline and profitability progress in our Construction Product segment. Organic revenues grew 5% in Q1 and that was led by Asia-Pacific, where organic revenues were up 14%. This was due to strong new housing, retail and commercial construction in Australia and New Zealand. European revenues grew a modest 1% in the quarter. North America construction organic revenues were flat, as improvement in residential construction were offset by declines in the commercial construction category.","Let me make a quick comment on our North American commercial construction business. While there has been talk of industry growth in the sector by both, peers and investors, our Dodge commercial data for Q1 on a square footage basis showed 13% less activity versus the year-ago period.","We do, however, think we'll see better commercial construction growth as the year progress, so stay tuned. Profitability continues to improve as we execute our enterprise initiatives across the segment. Q1 operating margin of 14.8% showed an impressive 310 basis point improvement over the year-ago period.","And in our final segment, Specialty Product segment, organic revenues grew 2% and was largely due to our consumer packaging businesses. Ground support grew 10% and appliance sector was flat. The segment continues to be very profitable with operating margins of 21.1%, that's 120 basis points higher than year-ago period.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Michael, who will update you on our Q2 and full year forecast. Michael?","Michael Larsen","Thanks, John. And as a result of our first quarter performance and lower share count, we're raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.45 to $4.65. The midpoint of our updated guidance, the $4.55, represents an increase of 25% versus 2013, and we now expect full year operating margins in the mid-19s.","We tighten the range for our full year revenue growth rate assumption and raising the low end from 2% to 3%, and we now expect total revenue growth to be in the 3% to 4% range. The organic revenue growth that goes with this assumption is unchanged at 2% to 3%.","Our second quarter guidance, we expect EPS within a range of $1.16 to $1.24, and this assumes total revenue growth of 3% to 5% and 100 basis points of margin expansions on a year-over-year basis from the initiatives.","So in summary, a good start to 2014. We're raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.45 to $4.65 and the midpoint being a 25% increase year-over-year.","With that, let me turn the call back over to John.","John Brooklier","Thank you, Michael. Now, we'll open the call to your questions. And in the interest of giving more people a chance to ask questions, please honor our one question, one follow-up question request. We're targeting to complete this call at the top of the hour. We'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Scott, maybe you can step back and talk about your geographic markets from a perspective that in the beginning of the year you said North America could grow in the 3% to 4% range and Europe could grow in the 2% range. 1Q performance was basically the opposite. Should we look for more growth in Europe from you this year and maybe less in North America or do you expect it to normalize over time? I mean we noticed that you said weather wasn't that much of an impact in 1Q.","Scott Santi","Well, I would say that based on our first quarter results, relative to our expectations heading into the year, I would say Europe has been a slight upside positive at 5% growth in the quarter, North America certainly at 1% was a lag. I don't know that that completely shifts our expectations for the year. I think we do see, again, based on some modest improvement in March and how April is tracking at North America at 1% probably we wouldn't expect that to be the number for the year.","We would expect some incremental improvement in North America from here. And again, I think the overall demand levels out of Europe that we're seeing are pretty broad-based across our businesses and I would consider that to be pretty encouraging at this point.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","I think a follow-up to that really is around the construction business overall. Asia really got stronger in the quarter. I think it was 4% year-over-year growth last quarter to 14% this quarter. Is it fair to say that you're actually seeing a nice recovery in Australia now? And you did mention some expected improvement in Q2 in North America and you mentioned that April was starting off well. Are you seeing them improvement as the weather has gotten better here in the U.S. in April?","Scott Santi","Yes, to both of your questions. I think Australia and New Zealand, clearly we're seeing some very positive overall demand improvement there. And we have sort of made a commitment not to talk about the weather as part of our results in the quarter, but what I would say is certainly North America for construction, along with the service business and Food Equipment were probably the two areas where it would be hard not to conclude that we had some pretty material weather impact on those businesses. And I think March and what we're seeing in April in construction in North America would suggest things are improving there for sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso.","David Raso - ISI Group","On the guidance increase of $0.15, can you quantify the way you're thinking about how much was from repo and how much was from essentially margins?","Michael Larsen","So what I'll tell you is, of the $0.15 approximately half is shares and the other half is better operational performance, which you're seeing in the operating margins. And we now expect to be in the mid-19s versus our previous guidance of 19, squiggle 19. So it's about half and actually if you -- well, talk about the first quarter for a second, the performance in the first quarter versus the guidance, the better performance was driven equally about half from shares and the other half from better operations.","David Raso - ISI Group","That's what I was thinking as well until you mentioned the more exact target on the margin, saying 19.5%?","Scott Santi","We've said mid-19s, yes.","David Raso - ISI Group","But before we were thinking 19%, correct?","Scott Santi","That's correct.","David Raso - ISI Group","Roughly, if you just add the 50 basis points there, I mean basically it looks like that alone at $0.10-plus. So I'm just making sure I'm not doing something wrong here in the sense of the margin improvement plus the repo would actually maybe a little more than $0.15, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand that 19% and 19.5% alone?","Scott Santi","I mean I can't really comment on your math. The math we're doing here internally is about half of the improvement here is from margins and the other half is from lower share count.","Operator","Next question comes from Rob Wertheimer.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research","I had a question about Brazil. There's been some mixed data in the economy and then I guess machinery and markets anyway coming out of there. I was curious where exactly you were strong, if it was content, if it was share, if it was what was going on there? And your thoughts on China as well, you mentioned the Auto, but just generally?","Scott Santi","Well, I think our position in Brazil was pretty concentrated in the Polymers and Fluids area and also with Welding and a few other businesses. And so what I would say about our own results in Brazil is it's much less about the overall economy. We are sort of transitioning from a period going back two or three years, where we did a fair amount of acquisition activity there to get ourselves positioned and are now starting to operate -- we're starting to operate these businesses and I think get focused on the areas of opportunity in terms of growth.","China for us, I think is right now clearly automotive is the leading business over there. We're seeing, what I would describe is more moderate overall economic activity across the number of our businesses. And the Welding business in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis was, Michael or John talked about it in his comments, a negative, primarily as a result of lower large oil and gas pipeline activity over there versus what was going on there last year.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research","If I can ask just one follow-up on Auto you mentioned in China. Can you talk just a bit just in principle about how the design curve works on your content wins? I mean you have done a great job obviously of growing auto markets. Is that something you can see reliably two years out, in three years at more that since your products aren't terribly complex, they can be engineered and faster? I'm just curious about how far out you'll take that?","Scott Santi","We talked about that before. This is the one part of the company where we have a fair amount of forward visibility. We are working on things today that are going into model redesigns that are going to be executed three years out typically.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research","And you're still seeing content growth throughout that three-year period?","Scott Santi","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from Jamie Cook.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","A couple of quick questions. Just to clarify, you increased your margin targets to mid-19 or so. Are you still expecting all the segments to show margin improvement in the quarter, because some of the results within the quarter, you know what I mean were mixed with some segments showing very strong improvement and some still showing decline. And then my second question, if you could just give a little more clarity on what you saw in the Test and Measurement on the order trend side, just sort of the trends you're seeing there and when you expect that to pick up and translate into revenue growth?","Michael Larsen","Why don't I do the margin expansion questions and then maybe Scott you want to comment on Test and Measurement. So yes, we do expect all of our businesses to expand margins in 2014 versus 2013. And I think you will see that progress again in the second quarter, here we'll continue that. We talk about Test and Measurement, little bit of an outlier, in terms of some increase restructuring spend, but we fully expect that business to be back on track in terms of margin expansion as we move forward from the second quarter and into the rest of the year. So now your second question was on?","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Just the second question, because you noted in the slides the order of trends in testing and measurement. It sounds like there were some delays or something like that. Can you just talk about, give a little more clarity there, the more insight as to translate it.","Scott Santi","What I would say about that is on the ground we're certainly seeing sort of better overall activity levels in terms of code activity levels, backlog is up. And from the timing and release standpoint, we're still seeing some fairly choppy customer demand from that standpoint. But again, I would say, the people in those business are feeling generally like things are heading in the right direction. The overall conditions are improving. I would say we're not in that mode with Welding at this point.","Operator","Next question comes from Ann Duignan.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","I know there have been a lot of questions about Automotive, but is it the right way to think about that business going forward that you'd be able to sustain growth at roughly the 2.5x to 3x global automotive build. Is that the right way to think about it for the next 12 to 18 months?","Scott Santi","2x to 3x, I don't think so. I think what we would be expecting on a longer term basis would be 300 to 400 basis points of market out performance on an annual basis.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","And then on the enterprise initiatives, they are at the 120 bps to margins. Can you just break that out sourcing versus product line simplification or the different initiatives that you're undergoing?","Scott Santi","They both contributed significantly to the 120 basis points.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","But equal, equal at this point?","Michael Larsen","We have said consistently we're not breaking this out, but to Scott's point they have both contributed significantly.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","And just on the same follow-up then, price cost added 10 basis points. It added 40 basis points in Q4. Is there anything we should be watching out for on the price cost side or is it just tougher comps?","Michael Larsen","No, there's really nothing unusual there. I mean I think the 10 basis points was a little bit lower than our assumptions for the year, which remains at 20 to 30 basis points of improvement. And so there is some timing and some FX headwind, but overall we continue to feel very comfortable about this 20 to 30 basis points for the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Deane Dray.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","Question for Michael. Post the close on industrial packaging you said, May 1, and you accelerated buybacks. Where do you expect leverage to come out on the second quarter and then the run rate exit for the year?","Michael Larsen","You're talking about debt to EBITDA leverage, right?","Deane Dray - Citigroup","Yes.","Michael Larsen","So we're currently little on the high side, at 2.4x, as we accelerated the repurchase program in part, because we saw the transaction closing sooner. Our target leverage ratio remains in the approximately 2.2x to 2.3x EBITDA on a go forward basis.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","And are you at all constrained -- and this is more directed to Scott also, but the idea on M&A, I know there is going to be -- we've shifted two-thirds core revenue growth, one-third M&A. How are you thinking about M&A for the balance of the year or might you be a bit constrained on the balance sheet?","Scott Santi","Well, I don't think given the cash flow of the company, the balance sheet isn't really the issue, where I would describe our position near-term is similar to what I've said I think couple of quarters ago on the call, which is given all that we are currently executing inside of the company around these initiatives and also our focus on organic acceleration, M&A isn't our near-term priority for us. But that being said, we did three really nice medium-sized deals last year that were really strong strategic fits and should similar opportunities emerge this year, we would not hesitate to pull the trigger.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","I think you called out some POS headwinds kind of on the topline for both Welding and Polymers and Fluids. I'm curious if you have visibility into sort of how long that lasts and when that's simplification kind of gets anniversaried and the growth rates might start giving a little better?","Scott Santi","I don't think we said that was an issue in Welding, in Polymers and Fluids, definitely. And what I would say is we're probably looking at in terms of drag another quarter or two maximum. And John pointed out, as we're seeing in the couple of businesses inside Polymers and Fluids that are coming out at the other end of that, in the Fluids platform that was up 4% organically.","John Brooklier","Auto, aftermarket also up.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","And on Welding I thought you were sort of trying to get away from shipbuilding or something?","Scott Santi","Well, I think that's really more of the portfolio repositioning we've done and that's been going out in the last couple of years there. So that's becoming less and less of the portfolio. I think they think they're going to probably be through most of that by the end of the year. This has been a two-plus year transition in the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","Can I get a one clarification on share count? You said you're going to finish your program at the end of second quarter, maybe roughly 400 million shares at the end of the quarter. Is that the number we should use for the second half of the year or do you intend to have some more normal share repurchases after that?","Scott Santi","The 400 million shares is the projected share count at the end of the second quarter. And so our focus here right now is on completing the IPG-related shares repurchase program, the 50 million shares that we announced back in September. And then we'll kind of reassess where we're at by the end of second quarter and we would be able to give you an update on the next earnings call.","But what I will tell you in terms of our capital allocation strategy, it has not changed. And so we remained focused on internal reinvestments in the business for future growth and margin expansion. We will continue the dividend obviously and then we'll balance acquisitions and share repurchases based on the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. And so that hasn't changed.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","I was just asking whether the guidance to $4.45, $4.65 assume that the share stay at 400 for the rest of the year? That's what I was just checking on that?","Scott Santi","That is correct.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","And from an operation, Welding has always been a problem child. Do you have any forecast for any improvement in Welding for the rest of this year or you'll have to wait until 2015?","Scott Santi","Well, let me first of all, Eli, disagree with your characterization that Welding is a problem child.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","Well, the value topline that I was talking about.","Scott Santi","Yes. So those of you that follow the company know that Welding has been historically one of our strongest organic growers, high single-digits through the cycle. The big thing that's going to get, Welding going again is North America honestly that we are still in the midst of a pretty significant contraction in the heavier equipment segments of the market that we serve. In our view, that's not a structural issue, that's a cyclical issue. We expect that to turn around hopefully some time this year. And at least our experience in Welding is once things do turn, we have six, eight quarters that are really solid organic growth.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Casey.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo","Just a couple of clarifications, I guess. On mid-19% operating margin guidance, is there any change in the anticipated restructuring or is that all driven by better operational performance?","Scott Santi","That's all better operational performance. So the restructuring for the year at approximately $100 million has not changed.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo","And then back on the sluggish CapEx trends specifically North American Welding. I am just curious -- and Scott, you kind of answered this, but can you comment on whether you saw any month-over-month improvement in that business in quoting or orders during Q1?","Scott Santi","Maybe some modest sequential improvement towards March, but nothing that I would say gives us any sort of enthusiasm at this point that we're seeing a real turn there.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo","And that typically how closely in line would that be with an increase in construction activity. I realize heavy equipment can be used in other stuff, but if there is an improvement as John indicated on the Construction Products business in the second half. Would that normally drive up Welding as well?","Scott Santi","Commercial construction will have some positive impact. Although the place of real softness again is more ag-equipment, mining equipment, et cetera.","Operator","Next question comes from John Inch.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Mike, what are the expected proceeds, net cash proceeds from the completion of the IP sale is expected to be?","Michael Larsen","The gross budget is $3.2 billion and we anticipate that the after-tax will be in the low-2s.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And then what exactly are you planning to do with the cash, because obviously you've sort of completed this, I realize what you just said that you're going to evaluate share repurchase at the end of the second quarter, but just help me, if there is some obvious earmark for in excess of $2 billion, because in theory, right, you can get your leverage targets simply by growing EBITDA as the outlook for the economy in your businesses continue to improve and you still get benefits of simplification. So I'm just curious on your thoughts toward deployment of the $2 billion?","Michael Larsen","So a little bit more than half of that will be utilized for the share repurchase program and get that completed by the end of the second quarter. And the balance will essentially be to reduce our outstanding commercial paper and get our debt to EBITDA leverage back into the 2.25 range that we discussed earlier.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Are there thoughts then just because interest rates are still very favorable toward -- again, as you grow your EBITDA, right, perhaps some more permanent swap of some of the commercial paper into term debt? Because otherwise you're going to have leverage that's -- financial leverage that's too low, if you continue on this track. So I'm just trying to understand how you're managing the product?","Michael Larsen","Right, so I think we've actually been fairly opportunistic here in terms of locking in rates and what we think is an attractive low interest environment and extending the duration of our debt portfolio. And so as I think you maybe aware we issued $2 billion worth of bonds here in the first quarter with an average duration little over six year, then a coupon that's on average in the low-2s. And we have some additional plans here for the rest of the year.","I think if you look at kind of a bigger picture, if you take a step back and look at where we were three years ago, so the average rate on our debt is about 200 basis points lower today than it was three years ago. The duration has been extended from fairly short-term in the three to four year range to well north of 10 years. So I think we've been fairly opportunistic in terms of our capital structure and are taking advantage of the current rate environment.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And then, Scott, if you will just take a look at simplification, enterprise initiatives, clearly this is paying pretty handsome dividends to ITW. Could you just remind us or give us your perspective, which of your segments are ahead of where you would have expected maybe a year ago and which still seem to have work to do? Because I don't think just a print of margins or performance alone gets at the underlying. So I'm very interested in your perspective of which of your segments kind of are ahead and which are behind?","Scott Santi","Well, I think where I would start on that is I think the sort of scope of work if you will that we had to do certainly varied at the front-end by segment and I would sort of point to -- if you look at the simplification initiatives as one example within Food Equipment and Welding, which were businesses that were the starting points was at a much larger overall division structure relative to the rest of the company. They had much less work to do.","The other end of the spectrum was Polymers and Fluids that was 130-odd divisions. So haven't really thought about it in terms of who's ahead or behind. But what I would say is I think overall the level of progress and execution remains robust and brisk. And there is a fair amount of runway left.","This isn't something we're wrapping up in the next couple of quarters, as we've talked before that we've got another couple of years easy of some continued work to do that is both accretive to our overall numbers, you know what our performance goals are and also it's going to result in a company that's much more focused and much more effective in terms of the growth agenda that we have going forward.","Michael Larsen","Right, but for instance Polymers and Fluids, I mean obviously it still has issues, but it might actually be ahead, which could in theory gives it a lot of operating leverage as the business starts to see better fundamental topline, for example, or Welding might be a little bit behind, which may help to explain a little bit of the margin. I don't know, I'm just -- is there any other sort of parsing that you might call out, Scott?","Scott Santi","I don't know. I was talking about construction before in terms of big margin improvement opportunity there. I think the progress, I think were up 250 basis points. Even the Auto business that I think is, there is sort of templates for kind of organic growth we want to build in all of our businesses has still got a pretty rigorous business structure simplification, an in sourcing agenda in front of it.","So a lot of leverage in terms of revenue growth, but margins up in the first quarter year-on-year, significant percentage of that was related to the initiatives as well. So it's hard for me to think in terms of who's ahead and behind. I think because the specific to-do list in each of the segments is pretty unique to those segments. But in general, I don't think we've got anybody dogging it. I think everybody is getting after it pretty good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ajay Kejriwal.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So I wanted to drill into the organic growth rate a little bit. Clearly a positive surprise as far as our model is concerned. And Scott, I know you've spent some time talking about China, Brazil and other markets. So the 6%that you're seeing in international markets 1Q, is there anything, as you analyze the performance there that jumps out as either channel related or anything that suggests that 6% may not be sustainable for the year?","Scott Santi","Nothing that I can think of Ajay.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So international continues at, say, around 6% and maybe better in the North America kind of based on what I heard earlier in the call, takes up, so we could expect growth rate to be better than what you printed in 1Q, right?","Scott Santi","I think we've talked about this before. Our forecasting approach in terms of what we're looking is that we're going to use run rates that we're seeing in the businesses today. You are certainly free to analyze the upside and downside opportunities and risks around that. But we've talked before about the fact that in our business model we have no incentive to get ahead of ourselves. We have a very fast reaction, fast cycle time, supply chain and manufacturing approach. And so from our standpoint, the most prudent planning assumptions for us are really deal with what we're seeing on the ground today.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Of course conservative is better as far as we are concerned, so good organic. Now, maybe on the incremental margins, real nice performance there, talk a little bit about Construction Products, so obviously it was an okay quarter, but margins picking up. How should we think about incrementals in that business as revenue start coming back?","Scott Santi","Well, I think the endgame there, as I've talked before, a number of us have talked is in terms of the raw material in that business from a performance standpoint, we expect that business to perform from a margin rate standpoint at or above the company goals on a long-term basis.","Given where they are today, despite a significant amount of improvement in the first quarter, as there is still some room to improve further between where they are in that 20%-plus goal. So the answer to your question is incremental margins for the next eight quarters are to be really good and accelerating topline helps us get there faster.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shivangi Tipnis.","Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities","My first question is on pricing. So you commented that it was about 10%. Was it linear across all segments?","Michael Larsen","No. The 10% is really an average.","Scott Santi","It wasn't 10%.","Michael Larsen","The 10 basis points.","Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities","Yes. Sorry, the 10 basis points.","Michael Larsen","So the 10 basis points is really an average, and I wouldn't read too much into it in terms of we have different timing around price increases in the various segments, and we had some FX impact in one business that we didn't see in another businesses. And so I would say we're still holding to the 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year and we're comfortable with that assumption.","Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities","But then what was the most pricing pressures and in what segment did you see the most headwinds that contributed to the lower expected EPS form the pricing? I think you were expecting at least 20 basis points even in the first quarter and you got about 10, can you talk about the headwinds?","Scott Santi","Yes. Again, I mean there is really nothing unusual in terms of head or tailwinds in the first quarter other than what I described. And so fairly normal quarter, in terms of price cost for us.","Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities","And one question on the auto build rates, can you talk a little bit about the near-term moderation in the auto build rates that you were talking about? And is this going to be globally, including China?","Scott Santi","We expect auto build rates in the second quarter to be in the sort of 1% to 2% range. That's a worldwide number. We would expect that virtually all of the geographies to be down sequentially from where they were in Q1. Into Q2, China looks like it's going to be roughly about the same. I don't think we see much of a change in China, but Europe looks like it's going to have a lower build rate based on the data we're seeing right now. North America looks like it's going to be a lower build rate. But remember, we continue to add our penetration numbers on top of that.","Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities","So just as a clarification, you mentioned that you would comfortably be able to outperform the auto build rates even with the moderation, is that correct?","Scott Santi","That's correct. But I think what we're basically trying to say is don't expect double-digit growth in Auto for next quarter based on a foundation of lower build rates.","Operator","Next question comes from Joel Tiss.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","I have just one quick question. Can you talk about some of the successes and maybe some frustrations on the organic growth and just what you're seeing, like you've done a great job of pointing out the gas cap, not having a gas cap anymore, those sorts of things, but just a little bit of color there?","Scott Santi","One of the things I would point out to is I would go back to the comment I made at the outset of the call, which is we've worked very hard on shaping the portfolio, so that we are in a collection of businesses that we have a lot of conviction about their ability to grow at a healthy clip organically. And again, those actions resulted in an overall organic growth rate for the company of a 100 basis points better in Q1 that would have been if we still were in some of the businesses that we have divested.","I would say, characterize our progress in organic as frustration at all. I think we're just getting in the position we've talked before about the fact that we've a lot of activity inside the company. We're trying to be very delivered. I'm talking about simplification and sourcing. We're trying to be very delivered about making sure that we're focused on the right things at the right time.","This year is a year we expect to turn our attention more to the organic growth agenda. But keep in mind we still have more than a fair amount of activity going on internally. But I think some of the acceleration on organic growth, we talked about Auto, Food Equipment now, Construction, Test and Measurement, it looks like its going to get going and then we've got a couple of other businesses that are not where we wanted them to be.","We talked about Welding, that's much more of a situation relative to the current market environment. And Polymers and Fluids, we got to get through this period of sort of reshaping and refocusing, but expect that business to certainly contribute from our organic standpoint. So I think we feel much better about the quality of the portfolio that we are going forward with, in terms of its organic growth potential and certainly expect to continue progress as we move down the road.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Krapfel.","Jim Krapfel - Morningstar","So you're still expecting a run rate of 100 basis points of margin improvements from your initiatives through the rest of 2014. Is that right?","Michael Larsen","That's correct. On a year-over-year basis, we expect 100 basis points a quarter from BSS and from sourcing.","Jim Krapfel - Morningstar","And then how much do you think you have left in the tank then for 2015?","Michael Larsen","Well, I think the way we'd answer that question is similar to what Scott talked about earlier, as we've laid out our goals very clearly for 2017, which is 20%-plus operating margins and 20%-plus return on invested capital on an after-tax basis. And so we're not going to give guidance for 2015 today, but the trajectory and the targets we've laid out as we continue to progress on this enterprise strategy, we're very confident that we will be able to achieve those targets.","Operator","Thank you. At this time there are no further questions on queue.","John Brooklier","So we thank everybody for joining us on today's call. And we look forward to talking to you again. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. So that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
